such remaining differences will be submitted to an Independent Accountant for
prompt determination. The Independent Accountant will determine those matters
in dispute and will render a written report as to the disputed matters, which
report shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties. The fees and expenses
of the Independent Accountant shall initially be borne fifty percent (50%) by
the Securityholders and fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer; provided that upon
resolution of the dispute by the Independent Accountant, the prevailing party,
if any, as determined by the Independent Accountant, shall be entitled to be
reimbursed in proportion to the amount by which the other party's
determinations of the items in dispute differed from the amount determined by
the Independent Accountant. Such amount shall be determined by the Independent
Accountant. Any fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant to be paid by
the Securityholders will be paid out of the Escrow Amount, and the Buyer and
the Securityholder Representative shall execute and deliver to the Escrow
Agent disbursement instructions for the amount of such fees and expenses to be
paid by the Securityholders from the Escrow Amount pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement.

  

  

(e) No Impairment of Other Rights. The Allocation Certificate (and the
agreement thereto) and the determination of the Final Adjustment Amount under
this Section 1.7 shall not impair any other rights of a party under this
Agreement, including any rights to indemnification; provided that no party
shall have any further rights with respect to (i) the calculation of Net
Working Capital or (ii) any disputed matters finally determined in accordance
with the resolution of dispute procedures set forth in Section 1.7(d)
(Resolution of Disputes); and provided further that there shall be no
duplication of recovery of any amounts hereunder.

shall send or cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of a
Certificate representing outstanding shares of the Company Stock (i) a letter
of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B-1 (the "Company Stock
Letter of Transmittal") specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates, and (ii) instructions for surrendering such Certificate in
exchange for the applicable Per Share Net Merger Consideration for each share
of the Company Stock represented by such Certificate. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation together with such Company Stock Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions, the Buyer shall cause the

22  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Consideration that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the
shares of the Company Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any portion of Merger Consideration payable to holders of
Certificates. It shall be a condition to the right of any Person, other than
the registered holder of a Certificate, to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable with respect to each share of the Company Stock
represented by such Certificate that (i) the Certificate be properly endorsed
or otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and (ii) the Person surrendering
such Certificate shall pay the allocable share, as determined under Section
6.6 (Certain Taxes) of any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than such
registered holder or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Buyer that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Buyer shall instruct the
Paying Agent to make payment of the foregoing consideration, for any
Stockholder who has submitted a Company Stock Letter of Transmittal duly
executed, and the related Certificates, prior to the Closing, by check or, if
wire instructions have been provided, by same day wire transfer, as soon as
practicable but in any event within one (1) Business Day after the Effective
Time, and for all other Stockholders, within two (2) Business Days following
receipt by the Paying Agent of a Company Stock Letter of Transmittal duly
executed, and the related Certificates.

  

  

(ii) Company Warrants. As soon as practicable after the Agreement Date, the
Buyer shall send or cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of the
Company Warrants (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit B-2 (the "Company Warrant Letter of Transmittal") specifying that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the applicable
Company Warrant shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the applicable
Company Warrant, and (ii) instructions for surrendering the applicable Company
Warrant in exchange for the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof. Upon surrender of the applicable Company Warrant for cancellation
together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such
instructions, the Paying Agent shall pay the applicable holder of the Company
Warrants the Company Common Warrant Net Merger Consideration or Company
Preferred Warrant Net Merger Consideration in respect thereof, as applicable,
and the Company Warrant so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any portion of the Company Warrant Merger
Consideration payable to any holder of the Company Warrants. The Buyer shall
instruct the Paying Agent to make payment of the foregoing consideration, for
any holder of Company Warrants who has submitted a Company Warrant Letter of
Transmittal duly executed, and the related Company Warrant, prior to the
Closing, by check or, if wire instructions have been provided, by same day
wire transfer, as soon as practicable but in any event within one (1) Business
Day after the Effective Time, and for all other holders of Company Warrants,
within two (2) Business Days following receipt by the Paying Agent of a
Company Warrant Letter of Transmittal duly executed, and the related Company
Warrant.

  

  

(c) Certificate Lost, Stolen or Destroyed. In the event that any Company
Warrant or any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Buyer shall issue or cause to be issued the respective Merger Consideration in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Warrant or Certificate
only following (i) delivery by the holder thereof of an affidavit of that fact
and such indemnities against any claim that may be made against the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent or the Paying Agent with respect to
the Company Warrant or Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed as are reasonably acceptable to the Buyer or otherwise required by
the Paying Agent, and (ii) in the sole discretion of the Buyer or otherwise
required by the Paying Agent, delivery of a non-refundable bond in such amount
as Buyer or Paying Agent may reasonably direct.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Return of Funds from Paying Agent. Any portion of amounts deposited with
the Paying Agent that remain undistributed to the Securityholders six (6)
months after their deposit with the Paying Agent shall, at the request of the
Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise
according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of
the Company Securities who have not surrendered such Company Securities in
compliance with this Section 1.10 shall after such delivery to the Surviving
Corporation, look only to the Surviving Corporation solely as general
creditors for the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 (Effect of the
Merger). To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any such amounts
deposited with the Paying Agent remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Securities immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(e) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this SECTION 1,
none of the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent, the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Securityholder Representative or any party hereto shall be
liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official in
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  

  

1.11 Dissenters Rights. Shares of the Company Stock held as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time by a Stockholder who has not voted such shares in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and with respect to
which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or forfeited before the
Effective Time (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted
pursuant to Section 1.8 (Effect of Merger), but shall thereafter constitute
only the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, in consideration of
the cancellation of such shares, such consideration as may be determined to be
due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. If a holder
of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Stockholder") forfeits or withdraws such
right to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then such holder's Dissenting Shares
shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be deemed to have been converted
as of the Effective Time into and to represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of the Company Stock pursuant
to Section 1.8 (Effect of Merger), without interest.

  

  

1.12 Tax Withholding; Treatment of Additional Payments. The Buyer, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, or Escrow Agent, as the
case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, the Company Equity Plan, the
Carve-Out Plan, the Company Warrants, the Letters of Transmittal or any
Ancillary Agreement, to or for the benefit of any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld and properly paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. The Company, the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders agree
to treat any adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.7(c)
(Post-Closing True-Up), if any, as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration
for all Tax purposes and shall take no position contrary thereto unless
required to do so by applicable Tax Law pursuant to a determination as defined
in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  

  

1.13 Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Sub, the officers and
directors from time to time of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized
in the name of the Company and the Merger Sub, as the case may be, or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action as is
consistent with this Agreement.

and identifying the respective responsible entity and including the aging
thereof. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, all such Accounts Receivable arose out of the provision of services
or the sales of goods in the ordinary course of business, are valid
obligations and are not subject to set-off or counterclaim, and, to the
Company's Knowledge, are collectible in the face value thereof using normal
collection procedures, net of the reserve for doubtful accounts (a) set forth
in the Interim Balance Sheet with respect to Accounts Receivable reflected in
the Interim Balance Sheet or incurred after the Interim Balance Sheet Date in
the ordinary course of business or (b) set forth on Schedule 2.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.8 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no discount or allowance from any Accounts
Receivable has been made or agreed to since the Interim Balance Sheet Date
other than in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice, and none of the Accounts Receivable shown on either the Interim
Balance Sheet or Schedule 2.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule represents
billings before actual receipt of a purchase order or a signed contractual
commitment. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the customers and other
debtors whose obligations comprise the Accounts Receivable shown on the
Interim Balance Sheet is subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, none of such Accounts Receivable has been
made subject to an assignment for the benefit of creditors. Since the Interim
Balance Sheet Date, (x) the collection of Accounts Receivable by the Company
has been pursued in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and
without any acceleration thereof, and (y) there has been no sale or other
disposition to a third party of any Accounts Receivable by the Company. All
accounts payable of the Company that arose after the Interim Balance Sheet
Date have been recorded on the accounting books and records of the Company.
All outstanding accounts payable of the Company represent valid obligations
arising from bona fide purchases of assets or services, which assets or
services have been delivered to the Company.

as set forth in Schedule 2.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there has

2.10 Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company have been timely filed.
All such Tax Returns are true, correct, and complete in all material respects,
and all Taxes owed by the Company, whether or not shown

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

on any Tax Return, have been paid when due. Except as set forth in Section
2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return.
Except as set forth in Section 2.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no
claim has ever been made in writing by any taxing authority in any
jurisdiction which the Company does not file that the Company is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

  

  

(b) All Taxes required to be withheld, collected or deposited by the Company
have been timely withheld, collected or deposited as the case may be, and to
the extent required, have been paid to the relevant taxing authority.

  

  

(c) No audit or other similar examination is currently pending with respect to
any Tax Return of the Company and the Company has not received any written
notice from any taxing authority that an audit or other review is forthcoming.
No deficiency for any Taxes has been asserted, proposed, or threatened against
the Company in writing, which deficiency has not been paid in full, and the
Company has not been notified of any such deficiency which is reasonably
likely to be asserted. No issue relating to the Company or involving any Tax
for which the Company might be liable has been resolved in favor of any taxing
authority in any audit or examination that, by application of the same
principles, would reasonably be expected to result in a deficiency for Taxes
of the Company for any other period. The Company has not participated or
engaged in any "listed transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4(b)(2) or any corresponding or similar provision of state,
local, or non-U.S. Tax Law.

  

  

(d) Schedule 2.10(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all United
States federal, state and local, and all foreign income Tax Returns filed with
respect to the Company for periods ending on or after December 31, 2011, and
indicates those Tax Returns that have been audited or subject to similar
examination by a taxing authority and those Tax Returns that currently are the
subject of audit or such examination. There are no outstanding agreements,
waivers or arrangements extending the statutory period of limitation (or any
other period during which any Tax can be assessed) applicable to any claim
for, or the period for the collection or assessment of, Taxes due from or with
respect to the Company for any taxable period, and no closing agreement
(within the meaning of Section 7121 of the Code) relating to the Taxes of the
Company is currently in force. The Company has delivered to the Buyer, or made
available the true, complete and correct copies of all Tax Returns of the
Company for which the statute of limitations has not terminated, and all audit
reports and statements of deficiencies for each of the last three taxable
years filed by or issued to the Company (or, insofar as such items relate to
the Company, by or to any affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group
of which the Company was then a member).

  

  

(e) The unpaid Taxes of the Company for all taxable periods (or portions
thereof) ending (i) on or before the Interim Balance Sheet Date did not, as of
such date, exceed the reserve for tax liability (rather than any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any
notes thereof) and (ii) on or before the Closing Date will not, as of the
Closing Date, exceed that reserve as adjusted to reflect the ordinary
operations of the Company after the Interim Balance Sheet Date and through the
Closing Date and the Transactions in accordance with the past customs and
practice of the Company in filing its Tax Returns.

  

  

(f) The Surviving Corporation will not be required to include any item of
income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any

of any (i) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date, (ii) "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax law) executed on or prior to the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Closing Date, (iii) intercompany transactions or any excess loss account
described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state or local income Tax law), (iv)
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, (v) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date, or
(vi) election under Section 108(i) of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law).

  

  

(g) No person holds the Company Stock that is subject to a substantial risk of
forfeiture (within the meaning of Section 83 of the Code) with respect to
which a valid election under Section 83(b) of the Code has not been made, and
no payment to any holder of the Company Stock of any portion of the
consideration payable hereunder with respect to Company Stock held by such
holder will result in compensation or other income to such person with respect
to which the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation would be required to deduct or
withhold any Tax, except with respect to such amounts (such as, for example,
imputed interest on deferred payments) for which withholding may be required
pursuant to an IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8 provided to the applicable withholding
agent, or pursuant to the presumption and other rules applicable to such
payments in the absence of such forms under the Code and the U.S. Treasury
Regulations thereunder. Schedule 2.10(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists (i) each person that has, to the Knowledge of the Company, disposed
since January 1, 2014 of any Company Stock in a transaction that would
constitute a "disqualifying disposition" (as defined in Section 421(b) of the
Code) together with a schedule of the stock disposed of in such transaction
and the exercise date of the option pursuant to which such stock was acquired
and (ii) each person for whom the Transactions would constitute a
disqualifying disposition.

  

  

(h) The Company has never been (i) a member of any affiliated group filing or
required to file a consolidated, combined, or unitary Tax Return or (ii) a
party to or bound by, nor does it have or has it ever had any obligation
under, any Tax sharing agreement or similar contract or arrangement. The
Company has no liability for the Taxes of any other Person under U.S. Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of applicable federal, state,
local, or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or
otherwise.

  

  

(i) The Company has not distributed to its stockholders or security holders
stock or securities of a controlled corporation in a transaction to which
Section 355 of the Code applies (i) in the two years before the date of this
Agreement or (ii) in a distribution which could otherwise constitute part of a
"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code) that includes the Transactions, and the Company was not
the subject of any such distribution pursuant to any transaction with respect
to which the Company has agreed to or is otherwise obligated to indemnify any
person for any Tax resulting from or attributable to such transaction.

  

  

(j) The Company is not and has not been during the applicable period specified
in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code, a United States real property holding
corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code.

  

  

(k) The Company is not a party to, or bound by, or has any obligation under,
any tax allocation or sharing agreement or similar contract or arrangement or
any agreement that obligates it to make any payment computed by reference to
the Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses of any other Person (other than
any "gross-up" and indemnification provisions in commercial lending contracts
and other contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business, the
principal purpose of which is not related to Taxes).

  

  

(l) Schedule 2.10(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all foreign
jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to Tax, is engaged in business
or has a permanent establishment (noting for each jurisdiction, which
categorization is applicable). The Company has not

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

   
 

entered into a gain recognition agreement pursuant to Treas. Reg. §
1.367(a)-8. The Company has not transferred an intangible asset the transfer
of which would be subject to the rules of Section 367(d) of the Code.

  

  

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company makes no representations and warranties with respect to the amount,
validity or usability of its net operating losses, Tax basis in its assets,
Tax credits, or other Tax attributes for taxable periods beginning after the
Closing Date. The representations and warranties set forth in this Section
2.10 and in the FIRPTA Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9.10 shall
constitute the only representations and warranties by the Company with respect
to Taxes and the other matters set forth herein.

(a) The Company is not and has not been in violation of any Order binding upon
it, or of any applicable Law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental
Entity applicable to its Business or assets, except for any such violations

Effect. The Company has not received any notice or other communication from
any Governmental Entity of any such violation or noncompliance, and there has
been no citation, fine or penalty imposed or, to the Company's Knowledge,
asserted against the Company for any violation of such laws, regulations or
ordinances.

comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are

correct copies thereof have previously been made available to the Buyer. No
proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to
revoke or limit any such Permit.

claim, legal, administrative or arbitration proceeding, or investigation
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving
the Company, any of its assets or properties or any of its directors or
officers in their capacities as such or that in any manner challenges or seeks
to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay any of the Transactions. To the Company's
Knowledge, there is no fact, event or circumstance that would reasonably be

which individually or in the aggregate would have a Material Adverse Effect.

all Employees and all consultants and contractors of the Company, have
executed such an agreement. The Company has recorded all assignments of any
Company Registered Intellectual Property assigned to the Company with the
relevant Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable laws and
regulations in each jurisdiction in which such assignment is required to be

commitment, or subject to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
administrative agency, that could interfere with such Employee's duties to the
Company, or that could conflict with the conduct of the Business.

  

  

(h) Except as set forth in Schedule 2.16(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Person has claimed or, to the Knowledge of the Company, has

cancelled, in its reasonable business judgment. The Company is not and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no other party to the Licenses Out relating to
Company Owned Intellectual Property is, in breach of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, its obligations under such
arrangements. The Company has implemented and maintained in effect reasonable
security measures, consistent with general industry practices, with respect to
third-party source code or other rights of any third party in any trade
secrets, in each case, including in the Company Intellectual Property. If the
terms of any License In require that customers of the Company enter into

reasonable manner by reasonably competent programmers certified in the

of any exclusive rights to use or joint ownership of, any Company Intellectual
Property, to any other Person, (ii) permitted the rights of the Company in any

Contract under which it has granted any covenant not to sue, assert or exploit
any such Company Intellectual Property, or (iv) entered into any Contract
under which it has granted any Person the right to bring a lawsuit for

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement do
not and will not conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or result in
any release of any source code of the Company Products or related materials

uses or disclosures, or other incidents of alleged compromises to the privacy
or security of any Personal Information. As used in this Agreement "HIPAA"

been and are being complied with in all material respects. The Company has and
maintains all applicable accounts, passwords, encryption algorithms and
programs or other access keys required by the Company and its Employees to
access the system programs and data files comprised by the Computer Systems.
The data processing and data storage facilities used by the Company in
connection with the operation of the business are reasonably protected in
respect of known security breaches. The Company has and maintains back-up
systems and disaster recovery and business continuity plans that are intended
to reasonably address the continuing availability of the functionality
provided by the Computer Systems in the event of any malfunction of, or other
form of disaster affecting, the Computer System. The Company is, on the
Agreement Date, in possession of the object code and available user manuals
for all third-party in-licensed software (other than off-the-shelf application

investigation by any Governmental Entity relating to the Antitrust Filings.
Buyer and the Company shall promptly inform the other of any communication

Governmental Entity relating to its Antitrust Filing. Buyer and the Company
shall give the other reasonable advance notice of, and the opportunity to
participate in any inquiry or investigation by, or any material meeting or
conference (whether by telecommunications or in person) with, any Governmental
Entity relating to the Antitrust Filings if, in the reasonable judgment of the
party that is subject to the inquiry, investigation, meeting or conference,
such participation by the other party is prudent and (based upon the advice of
legal counsel) legally permissible. Each of Buyer and the Company hereby
agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure termination or
expiration of any waiting periods under any applicable Antitrust Laws

require or be construed to require Buyer or any of its Affiliates, in order to
obtain the consent or successful termination or expiration of any review of
any Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions, to (i) sell or hold
separate, or agree to sell or hold separate, before or after the Closing Date,
any assets, businesses or any interests in any assets or businesses, of Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or to
consent to any sale, or agreement to sell, by Buyer, the Company or any

restriction on the operation by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of any assets
or businesses (including any assets or businesses of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries), (ii) modify any of the terms of this Agreement, or the
Transactions, or (iii) initiate or participate in any legal proceeding with
respect to any such matters.

  

  

(d) In the event that Buyer is requested, in order to obtain the consent or
successful termination or expiration of any review under any Law regarding the
Transactions, to take any of the actions set forth in Section 4.5(c) or if
such consent, successful termination or expiration has not been
unconditionally obtained by December 31, 2014, Buyer shall have the right to
abandon its efforts to obtain approval under such Antitrust Law of the
Transactions, notwithstanding this Section 4.5. If Buyer so elects to abandon
its efforts to seek such approval, it shall promptly give notice of such
abandonment to the Company.

Company or any of the Subsidiaries (any of the transactions described in

any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or
knowingly encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek, a
Third-Party Acquisition.

this Agreement, if the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any Representative
receives an inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a Third-Party Acquisition
from any Person, the Company shall (i) promptly notify Buyer of the same and
the details thereof (including the identity of the Person making same) and the

the status thereof.

  

  

4.7 Confidentiality; Potential Buyers. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
abide by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the

for such Potential Buyer to immediately destroy or return to the Company any
confidential information of the Company and the Subsidiaries, for distribution
immediately following the Closing.

  

  

4.8 Injunctive Relief. The Company acknowledges that any breach or threatened
breach of the provisions of Section 4.5 (Antitrust Filings), Section 4.6
(Nonsolicitation), or Section 4.7 (Confidentiality; Potential Buyers) of this
Agreement will cause irreparable injury to the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company and/or their respective Subsidiaries for which an
adequate monetary remedy does not exist. Accordingly, in the event of any such
breach or threatened breach, the Buyer (in the cases of Section 4.5 (Antitrust
Filings), or Section 4.6 (Nonsolicitation)) and the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company and/or such Subsidiaries (in the case of Section 4.7
(Confidentiality; Potential Buyers)) shall be entitled, in addition to the
exercise of other remedies, to seek and (subject to court approval) obtain
injunctive and other equitable relief, without necessity of posting a bond,
restraining the Company from committing such breach or threatened breach. The
right provided under this Section 4.8 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any other rights and remedies available to the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Company or such Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing,
it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by the
Company, by any of the Subsidiaries or by any of their respective
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

  

  

4.9 Section 280G Approval. If any Person is or may be or become entitled to
any payments, or is a party to any Contract that under certain circumstances
would reasonably entitle him or her to any payments, in either case that will
not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code if the stockholder approval
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code are not satisfied, then the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
stockholder approval as promptly as is practicable after the Agreement Date
and in any event prior to the Closing Date. Any submission for stockholder
approval shall be subject to the Buyer's prior review and approval, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

4.10 Public Disclosure. Except as contemplated by this Agreement or as
otherwise required by Law (including applicable securities Laws), regulatory
authority or court order or, with respect to the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, by listing agreement, no disclosure (whether or not in response to
an inquiry) of the existence or subject matter of this Agreement shall be made
by any party hereto (including any third-party representatives of Buyer, the
Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates) (other
than any filing by Buyer or any of its Affiliates with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or other Governmental Entity as required by applicable
Law, any communications with any Securityholder and third parties to obtain
the consents and approvals required under this Agreement and applicable Law,
or any communications by a Stockholder with its limited partners, members or
other investors), whether before or after the Closing, unless approved by
Buyer prior to release; provided that such approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, further that in no event shall any
party or Representative make any such disclosure prior to the Buyer issuing a
press release publicly announcing this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, in the event that either Buyer (or any
Affiliate thereof) or the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (or any of its or
their respective Affiliates) is required by Law or any listing or trading
agreement to make any such disclosure, such party shall notify the other prior
to making such disclosure and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
give the other an opportunity (as is reasonable under the circumstances) to
comment

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

   
 

on such disclosure. The Buyer shall provide the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any press release that the Buyer intends
to issue to publicly announce this Agreement.

  

  

4.11 Termination of Company Options and Company Warrants. The Company will use
all reasonable efforts to arrange for the termination of (i) the Company
Equity Plan, (ii) all Company Options, and (iii) all Company Warrants,
contingent upon the Closing and automatically effective as of immediately

Transmittal in respect thereof.

  

  

4.12 Source Code Remediation. The Company shall use its best efforts to (a)
complete to Parent's satisfaction the source code remediation and related
activities detailed on Schedule I, and (b) cooperate with Parent's efforts to

related activities.

  

  

4.13 Resignation of Officers and Directors. The Company shall obtain the
resignations of all members of the Company Board and all statutory officers of

4.14 Certain Deliveries. As soon as practicable after the Agreement Date, the
Company will deliver to the Buyer's outside counsel on one or more CD-Rom
disks, a complete and accurate (as of the Agreement Date) electronic copy of
the "data room" (the "Signing Disk"). Until the Closing, the Signing Disk and
the documents and other information thereon shall remain subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement. Delivery of any item included in the Signing
Disk shall constitute "delivery" within the meaning of SECTION 2 so long as
the relevant item was included in the "data room" and Buyer's legal
representatives had unrestricted access thereto for a continuous period of at
least three (3) Business Days immediately prior to the Agreement Date.

  

  

SECTION 5

  

  


 

  

  

COVENANTS OF THE BUYER

  

  

5.1 Representations and Warranties. Until the earlier of the Effective Time
and termination of this Agreement, the Buyer will not take any action that
would cause any of the representations and warranties made by the Buyer in
this Agreement not to be true and correct in all material respects on and as
of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if such representations
and warranties had been made on and as of the Closing Date.

  

  

5.2 Efforts. Pending the Closing, the Buyer will use all reasonable efforts to
cause the conditions specified in SECTION 8 (Conditions to Each Party's
Obligation to Close) and SECTION 10 (Conditions to Company's Obligation to
Close) to be satisfied as soon as practicable.

  

  

5.3 Confidentiality. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall abide by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

5.4 Director and Officer Indemnification.

  

  

(a) The Buyer agrees that, for a period of six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, (i) all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation by the Company or any Subsidiary now existing in favor of each
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Agreement Date or who
becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company, as

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

   
 

provided in the Company Certificate of Incorporation, Company Bylaws, the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary, the agreements set forth on
Schedule 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, and solely in their capacity as such (and not as a
Securityholder) (the "Company Indemnitees"), in each case as in effect on the
Agreement Date shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation or its successor
shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its successor
to, fulfill and honor in all respects all such rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company in favor of the Company
Indemnitees described above in clause (i) of this Section 5.4(a).

  

  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a fully prepaid "tail"
policy under the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, (ii) covers only those persons who are currently covered by
the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and only for matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) contains coverage terms comparable to
those applicable to the current directors and officers of the Company (the
"Company DandO Tail Policy"). The entire cost of the Company DandO Tail Policy,
including any and all premiums, expenses, fees and other costs, will be
treated as a Transaction Expense hereunder. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall deliver to the Buyer evidence of the amount of all such costs. If the
Merger is consummated, then the Buyer shall maintain the Company DandO Tail
Policy in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder, provided the obligations contained in this sentence shall not
require the Buyer to incur any expenses in connection therewith.

  

  

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.4 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnitees and their respective
heirs, personal representatives, successors and assigns. No party to this
Agreement shall take any action as to materially and adversely affect any
Company Indemnitees to whom this Section 5.4 applies without the prior written
consent of such Company Indemnitee.

  

  

(d) In the event the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.4.

  

  

5.5 Payment of Company Debt. At or immediately following the Effective Time,
the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to pay the Company
Debt Payoff Amount set forth on the Allocation Certificate to the applicable
third parties.

  

  

5.6 Employment and Benefits Arrangements.

  

  

(a) Within a reasonable period of time after the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall enroll the Continuing Employees and Non-Signing Employees in the Buyer's
employee benefit plans (including any severance plans) for which such
employees are eligible (the "Buyer Plans"), providing for benefits that, in
the Buyer's discretion, are substantially similar in the aggregate to the
benefits provided by the Buyer to its employees (excluding the Continuing
Employees and Non-Signing Employees) who are generally similarly situated
(i.e. regular full time, part-time, temporary, intern) to such Employees, and
the Buyer shall, to the extent permissible under such Buyer Plan, recognize
the prior service with the Company of each of such Employees for purposes of
eligibility to participate and vesting (but not benefit accruals) under the
Buyer Plans. Buyer shall cause each applicable Buyer Plan to waive, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the relevant insurance carriers,
eligibility waiting periods, evidence of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

   
 

insurability requirements and pre-existing condition limitations. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law and the relevant insurance carriers and to
the extent applicable in the plan year that contains the Closing Date and
subject to the timing of the addition of the Continuing Employees and Non-
Signing Employees to the Buyer Plans and subject to the reasonable cooperation
of the applicable Employee, the Continuing Employees and Non-Signing Employees
shall be given credit under the applicable Buyer Plan for amounts paid during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs under a corresponding
benefit plan of the Company for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments
and out-of-pocket maximums, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Buyer Plan. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
the provisions of this Section 5.6(a) shall not apply to the employees of the
German Sub.

  

  

(b) After prior consultation with the Company, the Hiring Affiliate may
contact the Signing Employees in connection with preparing, making or
determining whether to make offers of new employment with the Hiring
Affiliate, on terms and conditions that the Hiring Affiliate determines in its
sole discretion; provided that the Company may require, as a condition to the
Hiring Affiliate making such contact with a Signing Employee, that a member of
the Company's management team or human resources department be allowed to
participate in any call or meeting with such Signing Employee. The Company
shall cooperate with and use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist the
Hiring Affiliate in its efforts to secure satisfactory employment arrangements
with the Signing Employees and to obtain executed Offer Package Agreements
from each such Signing Employee receiving an offer of employment with the
Hiring Affiliate. Each Signing Employee (excluding, for the sake of clarity,
the Non-Signing Employees) who accepts an offer of employment with the Hiring
Affiliate, executes and delivers each Offer Package Agreement and actually
becomes employed with the Hiring Affiliate is hereafter referred to as a
"Continuing Employee". The employment by the Surviving Corporation of the
Signing Employees who are Continuing Employees shall continue following the
Closing and end on a date to be designated by the Hiring Affiliate and the
employment by the Hiring Affiliate of the Signing Employees who are Continuing
Employees shall commence at 12:01 A.M. on the day after such date. The
employment of the Non-Signing Employees shall continue following the Closing.
All Continuing Employees will be employed by the Hiring Affiliate on an at-
will basis (terminable with or without cause and with or without notice)
except for Continuing Employees located in a jurisdiction that does not
recognize the "at will" employment concept and with respect to the Signing
Employees who are Continuing Employees on terms of employment determined by
the Hiring Affiliate as set forth in the Offer Package Agreements.

  

  

(c) Each Signing Employee who is a Continuing Employee shall be required, as a
condition to employment with the Hiring Affiliate, to execute and deliver to
the Buyer, such Signing Employee's Offer Package Agreement.

  

  

(d) Buyer or an Affiliate of the Buyer will distribute the aggregate amounts,
if any, payable under the Carve-Out Plan on the terms and conditions set forth
in the Carve-Out Plan and as set forth in Section 1.9(c). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, solely with respect to the distributions under the Carve-Out Plan
that have been submitted for approval of the Stockholders under Section
280G(b)(5)(B) and for which approval was not obtained, such distributions
shall not be paid to the extent they would result in a "disqualified
individual's" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) receipt of
"parachute payments" under Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code. The Company will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each recipient of an
award under the Carve-Out Plan an acknowledgement of receipt and waiver (the
"Carve-Out Waiver Agreement") in form and substance satisfactory to the Buyer.
Without the prior written consent of Buyer, the Company will not amend,
cancel, modify or terminate the Carve-Out Plan or any Carve-Out Waiver
Agreement.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) Buyer shall pay, or cause the Hiring Affiliate to pay, to each Continuing
Employee and Non-Signing Employee an annual cash bonus for the 2014 calendar
year at the time such annual cash bonus would otherwise have been paid by the
Company in the ordinary course of business in accordance with the terms of the
applicable Company Benefit Plan existing as of the Agreement Date, based on
the performance level actually achieved; provided, however, that such
aggregate bonus amount shall not be less than the amount set forth on Schedule
5.6(e). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the provisions of this Section 5.6(e)
shall not apply to the employees of the German Sub.

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Section 5.6, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
upon any person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Section 5.6. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of
this Section 5.6 will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current
or former employee, director or consultant of Company in respect of continued
employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this
Section 5.6 is intended (i) to amend any Company Benefit Plan or any benefit
plans or programs of Buyer or the Hiring Affiliate, (ii) interfere with
Buyer's or the Hiring Affiliate's right from and after the Closing Date to
amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan or benefit plan or program of
Buyer or the Hiring Affiliate, or (iii) interfere with Buyer's or the Hiring
Affiliate's right from and after the Effective Time to terminate the
employment or provision of services by any director, employee, independent
contractor or consultant.

  

  

SECTION 6

  

  


 

  

  

TAX COVENANTS

  

  

6.1 Consistent Tax Reporting. The Securityholders, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the Buyer shall (a) treat and report the Transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in all respects consistently with the
provisions of this Agreement for purposes of any federal, state, local or
foreign Tax and (b) not take any actions or positions inconsistent with the
obligations of the parties set forth herein.

  

  

6.2 Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Surviving
Corporation shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns of the Company for taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Taxable Periods") that have not been filed
prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall permit the Securityholder
Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the
prior sentence at least ten (10) days prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Securityholder Representative. The Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or extend the statute of limitations period in
respect of any such Tax Return without the written consent of the
Securityholder Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. All Tax Returns to be prepared by or for the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the past practice of the Company, except as otherwise required
by law. The Securityholders shall be responsible for all Taxes of the Company
for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods including Taxes resulting from any
Contest, and shall pay to (or as directed by) the Company any Taxes of the
Company for all Pre-Closing Taxable Periods except to the extent that such
Taxes are taken into account in the final determination of Net Working Capital
or otherwise deducted from the Merger Consideration under Section 1.7(a) or
taken into account in determining the Final Adjustment Amount. Such payments
shall be made no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for
paying such amount of Taxes to the relevant tax authority.

  

  

6.3 Tax Periods That Include But Do Not End on the Closing Date. The Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the
Surviving Corporation for taxable periods that include but do not end on the
Closing Date. The Buyer shall permit the Securityholder Representative to
review and comment on each such Tax Return at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

66  

  

 

 

 

   
 

filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably
requested by the Securityholder Representative. The Securityholders shall be
responsible for all Taxes that relate to the pre-Closing portion of such
Taxable periods as determined under this Section 6.3, including any such Taxes
resulting from any Contest. The Securityholders shall pay to (or as directed
by) the Surviving Corporation, amounts equal to such Taxes except to the
extent that such Taxes are taken into account in the final determination of
Net Working Capital or otherwise deducted from the Merger Consideration under
Section 1.7(a) or otherwise taken into account in determining the Final
Adjustment Amount. Such payments shall be made in each applicable case by no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the due date for paying such amount
of Taxes to the relevant Tax authority. For purposes of this Section 6.3, in
the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for
a taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the
portion of such Tax that relates to the pre-Closing period shall (a) in the
case of any property Taxes and Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income, payroll, sales or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and
(b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, payroll, sales or
receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant
Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits relating a taxable
period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated
on a basis consistent with the allocations made pursuant to the preceding
sentence.

  

  

6.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters.

  

  

(a) The Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Securityholders, and the
Securityholder Representative shall cooperate fully, to the extent reasonably
requested by the others, and shall cause their respective Affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors and other representatives reasonably to
cooperate, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to Sections
6.2 (Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date) and 6.3 (Tax Periods
That Include But Do Not End on the Closing Date) or otherwise, and any audit,
examination, litigation, or other proceeding with respect to Taxes (each, a
"Contest") and will provide prompt written notice thereof. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return filing or Contest and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

  

  

(b) The Securityholders and the Securityholder Representative agree that all
books and records in their possession with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company, the Surviving Corporation are the property of the Company and,
subsequent to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation. The
Securityholders shall deliver all such books and records to the Company prior
to Closing. After the Closing the Surviving Corporation shall make available
to the Securityholder Representative such books and records to the extent
reasonably necessary for the Securityholder Representative's review and
comment of Tax Returns pursuant to Section 6.2 (Tax Periods Ending on or
Before the Closing Date) or for any other reasonable purpose related to the
Securityholders' ownership of the Company prior to the Closing.

  

  

(c) If requested by the Buyer, the Company, the Securityholders and the
Securityholder Representative will cooperate with the Buyer to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could
be imposed upon the Company or the Surviving Corporation (including, but not
limited to, with respect to the Transactions contemplated hereby).

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) The Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Securityholders and
the Securityholder Representative further agree, upon request, to provide the
other parties with all information that any party may be required to report
pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Department Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

  

  

6.5 Control of Audits. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in the
remainder of this Section 6.5, the Surviving Corporation shall control the
conduct, through counsel of its own choosing, of any Contest involving any
asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the Surviving Corporation or
any of the Subsidiaries. In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date that
relates solely to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Surviving Corporation shall
control the conduct of such Contest, but the Securityholder Representative
shall have the right to participate in such Contest at the expense of the
Securityholders, and the Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise
and/or concede any portion of such Contest that could affect the Tax liability
of the Securityholders for any taxable period (or portion thereof) after the
Closing Date without the written consent of the Surviving Corporation (not to
be unreasonably withheld). If a Contest does not relate solely to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, but the resolution of such Contest would result in a Tax
for which the Securityholders are responsible pursuant to Section 6.2 or
Section 6.3, or affects the amount of a refund payable to the Securityholders
pursuant to Section 6.7, then the Surviving Corporation shall control the
conduct of such Contest through counsel of its own choosing, and the
Securityholder Representative shall have the right to participate in such
Contest at the expense of the Securityholders, and such Contest shall not be
settled without the written consent of the Securityholder Representative (not
to be unreasonably withheld). In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of this Section 6.5 and the provisions of Section 11.4 (Notice and
Opportunity to Defend), the provisions of this Section 6.5 shall control.

  

  

6.6 Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, real property gains,
stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees incurred in connection with
this Agreement shall be shared equally by the Buyer and the Securityholders.
The Surviving Corporation will file all excess Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, real
property gains, stamp, registration, and other such Taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable law, the Buyer and the Securityholders will join in the
execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The Securityholders
shall satisfy their share of such Taxes, and will pay on a several (and not
joint) basis any remaining deficiency, to the Surviving Corporation when due.

  

  

6.7 Refunds and Tax Benefits. Any refunds that are received by Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation that relate to a Pre-Closing Period or that portion of a
Straddle Period ending on or before the Closing Date of the Company shall be
for the account of the Securityholders, and Buyer shall pay over to the
Securityholders any such refund (net of any Taxes of the Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation attributable to such refund or credit) within five days
after receipt or entitlement thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such
refunds of Taxes shall be for the account of Buyer to the extent such refunds
of Taxes are attributable to the carryback of items of loss, deduction or
credit, or other Tax items, of the Company (or any of their respective
Affiliates, including Buyer) for a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.

  

  

6.8 Carve-Out Payments. The parties hereto shall treat the Carve-Out Payments
paid on the Closing Date as properly allocable to the portion of the day after
the Closing shall occur, which shall be treated for all federal income tax
purposes as occurring at the beginning of the day following the Closing, and
which therefore shall be deductible by the affiliated group of which Buyer and
the Company will be members on the day following the Closing.

in Section 9.1 (Compliance; Certificate); provided that none of such
supplemental information shall constitute an amendment of any statement,

or warranty is made only as of a specific date, in which event such
representation and warranty shall be true and correct in all material
respects, as the case may be, as of such specified date), except that those
representations and warranties that by their terms are qualified by
materiality or a "Material Adverse Effect" (or words of similar effect) shall
be true and correct in all respects; each of the Buyer and the Merger Sub
shall have performed and complied with all covenants and agreements required

SECTION 11

  

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

11.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants.

  

  

(a) Representations. The representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered by or
on behalf of a party pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, any investigation by or on behalf of the
Buyer, the Merger Sub, the Company or the Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective Affiliates, and the Effective Time. No action for a breach of the
representations and warranties contained herein or in the certificates
delivered pursuant to Sections 9.1 or 10.1, shall be brought more than twenty-
four (24) months after the Closing Date, except for claims arising out of: (i)
the IP Representations, which shall survive until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on
the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (ii) (x) the
Fundamental Representations, and (y) the Tax Representations, which shall
survive until 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on the date on which all applicable
statutes of limitation (as the same may be extended or waived) shall have
expired, and except, in all cases, with respect to any Loss, claim or breach
of which any Indemnified Party shall have provided written notice to the
Securityholder Representative or Buyer, as the case may be, prior to such
termination. The representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.1
(Organization and Qualification), 2.2(a) and (b) (Capitalization;
Subsidiaries), 2.3 (Authority; Enforceability), 2.23 (Brokers) are sometimes
referred to herein as the "Fundamental Representations". The representations
and warranties of the Company and/or any of the Subsidiaries, set forth in
Section 2.16 (Intellectual Property), and Sections 2.9(p) and 2.21(a)(v) are
sometimes referred to herein as the "IP Representations". The representations
and warranties of the Company and/or any of the Subsidiaries, set forth in
this Agreement and related to Taxes, including those set forth in Section 2.10
(Tax Matters) or in the FIRPTA Certificate delivered pursuant to Section 9.10
are sometimes referred to herein as the "Tax Representations".

  

  

(b) Covenants. The respective covenants, agreements and obligations of the
Company, the Buyer, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders and the Securityholder Representative set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, any investigation by or on behalf of any party hereto, and the
Effective Time without limitation and shall terminate on the expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitation (as the same may be extended or waived),
except (i) as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or in such
certificate, document or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto and (ii)
only such covenants, agreements and obligations which by their terms
contemplate complete performance prior to the Closing shall survive the
Closing to the extent of such pre-Closing obligations only until the date that
is twenty-four (24) months after the Closing Date.

  

  

(c) Effect of Survival Periods. The survival periods set forth in this SECTION
11 are intended to operate only as the time periods within which a party must
deliver to the other party a written notice of Loss, claim or breach, and
following such delivery the notifying party shall be entitled to pursue its
available remedies with respect thereto pursuant to the provisions of and
subject to the limitations in this Agreement regardless of the survival
periods set forth in this SECTION 11. It is the express intent of the parties
that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated by this SECTION 11 is
shorter than the statute of limitations that would otherwise have been
applicable, then, by contract, the applicable statute of limitations shall be
reduced to the shortened survival period contemplated hereby.

  

  

11.2 Obligation of the Securityholders to Indemnify.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

72  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(a) General Matters. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.5
(Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies) hereof, after the Effective
Time, as an integral term of the Merger, the Securityholders shall, severally
and not jointly based on his, her or its respective Pro Rata Share, indemnify,
reimburse, compensate and hold harmless the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective directors, officers,
employees, partners, members, agents, Affiliates and assigns (collectively,
the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee directly or indirectly, as a result of, with
respect to or in connection with:

  

  

(i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the Company in
this Agreement or any certificate, document or other instrument delivered by
or on behalf of the Company pursuant hereto, either as of the Agreement Date
or as of the Closing (disregarding for purposes of this Section 11.2(a)(i) any
"material", "in all material respects", "Material Adverse Effect", or similar
qualifiers, both for purposes of determining whether a representation or
warranty is inaccurate or has been breached and for purposes of calculating
Losses);

  

  

(ii) any failure by the Company (prior to the Effective Time) or the
Securityholder Representative to fully perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement set forth herein or in any certificate, document or other instrument
delivered by such party pursuant to this Agreement;

  

  

(iii) any Dissenting Share Payments and any Change in Control Payments to the
extent not included in the Allocation Certificate;

  

  

(iv) the failure of any item set forth in the Allocation Certificate to be
accurate, true and correct in all respects as of the Closing (regardless of
any approval of such Allocation Certificate by the Buyer pursuant to Section
1.7 (Merger Consideration));

  

  

(v) any Company Debt as of the Closing to the extent not included in the
Company Debt Payoff Amount set forth in the Allocation Certificate;

  

  

(vi) any claims by (a) any current or former holder or alleged current or
former holder of any equity, membership or ownership interest or equity
security of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, including Company
Securities, Purchase Rights with respect thereto, relating to or arising out
of (A) the Transactions, this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, including
the calculation and allocation of the Merger Consideration or Carve-Out
Payments, or (B) such Person's status or alleged status as an equity holder,
member or owner of equity or ownership interests in the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries at any time at or prior to the Closing, whether for breach of
fiduciary duty or otherwise, (b) any Person to the effect that such Person is
entitled to any equity, membership or ownership interest or equity security or
any payment in connection with the Transactions other than as specifically set
forth on the Allocation Certificate, or (c) any Person with respect to any
Purchase Right, stock option scheme or plan, unit option scheme or plan or any
other scheme, plan, policy or Contract providing for equity or ownership
interest compensation to any Person;

  

  

(vii) any "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of
the Code) made by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries on or prior to the
Closing Date or otherwise required to be paid by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries pursuant to Contracts, Change in
Control Agreements or Employee Benefit Plans entered into or adopted on or
prior to the Closing Date;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

73  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(viii) any claims for indemnification or expense reimbursement by or in
respect of any Employee or any agent of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
with respect to any matter which, if brought against the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, would have been a Loss for which an Indemnified Party would have
been entitled to indemnification pursuant to any of the other provisions of
this Section 11.2;

  

  

(ix) any Taxes due with respect to periods (or portions thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, as determined pursuant to SECTION 6 (Tax Covenants);
and

  

  

(x) the items set forth on Schedule 11.2(a)(x).

  

  

(b) Individual Stockholders. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
11.5 (Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies) hereof, after the
Effective Time, as an integral term of the Merger, each Stockholder shall,
severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees
from and against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnitee, directly or indirectly, as a result of, with respect to or in
connection with any breach of or noncompliance with the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in such Stockholder's Letter of
Transmittal.

  

  

11.3 Obligation of the Buyer to Indemnify. Subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 11.5 (Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies) hereof,
after the Effective Time, as an integral term of the Merger, the Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Securityholders from and against any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by any Securityholder directly or indirectly, as a
result of, with respect to or in connection with any breach or violation of
the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Buyer, the
Merger Sub or, subsequent to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this Agreement.

  

  

11.4 Notice and Opportunity to Defend.

  

  

(a) A party or parties entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified
Party") with respect to a Third-Party Claim (a "Third-Party Claim") will give
the party or parties required to provide such indemnification (the
"Indemnifier") prompt written notice of any legal proceeding, claim or demand
instituted by any third party (in each case, a "Claim") in respect of which
the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided that
the failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifier of its
indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) that the Indemnifier is actually and materially prejudiced by the
failure of the Indemnified Party to provide such prompt notice.

  

  

(b) If the Indemnifier provides written notice to the Indemnified Party within
twenty (20) days after the Indemnifier's receipt of written notice from the
Indemnified Party of such Claim, the Indemnifier shall have the right, at the
Indemnifier's expense, to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal
with such Claim and to have the Indemnified Party represented by counsel,
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, selected by the Indemnifier;
provided that (i) the Indemnified Party may participate in any proceeding with
counsel of its choice and at its expense, (ii) the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, at any time when the Buyer believes in good faith that any Claim
is having or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Buyer or the Business, or involves a Tax liability for a post-Closing
period, may assume the defense and otherwise deal with such Claim in good
faith, with counsel of its choice, (iii) the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
at any time when the Buyer believes that a claim for indemnification relates
to or arises in connection with any criminal matter, may assume the defense
and otherwise deal with such Claim in good faith with counsel of its choice,
(iv) the Indemnifier may not assume the defense of any Claim if a material
conflict of interest exists between the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

74  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Indemnifier and the Indemnified Party that precludes effective joint
representation or the amount of any claims exceeds or reasonably could exceed
the limitations set forth in Section 11.5(b), if applicable, and (v) the
Indemnified Party may take over the defense and prosecution of a Claim from
the Indemnifier if the Indemnifier has failed or is failing to diligently
prosecute or defend such Claim following the provision of written notice to
the Indemnifier of such failure and the failure of the Indemnifier to cure
such failure within fifteen (15) days of receipt of such notice; and provided,
further that the Indemnifier may not enter into a settlement of any Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, unless such settlement provides
the Indemnified Party with a full release from such Claim and requires no more
than a monetary payment for which the Indemnified Party is fully indemnified.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
neither the Indemnified Party nor any of its Affiliates may settle or
otherwise dispose of any Third-Party Claim for which the Indemnifier may have
a liability under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifier, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense or is otherwise
negotiating any such Third-Party Claim, (x) the Indemnifier may participate in
any proceeding or negotiation with counsel of its choice and at its expense,
and (y) the Indemnifier may take over the defense and prosecution of a Claim
from the Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party has failed or is failing
to diligently prosecute or defend such Claim following the provision of
written notice to the Indemnified Party of such failure and the failure of the
Indemnified Party to cure such failure within fifteen (15) days of receipt of
such notice.

  

  

(c) Any notice that a Buyer Indemnitee shall be required to give to the
Securityholders shall be satisfied by the delivery of notice by the Buyer
Indemnitee to the Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder
Representative may respond to the Buyer Indemnitee on behalf of all
Securityholders.

  

  

11.5 Limitations on Indemnification; Other Remedies. The indemnification
provided by SECTION 11 (Indemnification) shall, except as provided in Section
(i) (Fraud), be subject to the following limitations:

  

  

(a) Basket. No indemnification shall be payable pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i)
(other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation or a Tax
Representation for which this Section 11.5(a) shall not apply) unless the
total amount of all indemnifiable Losses incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees,
including those subject to all previous claims, exceeds $750,000 (the
"Basket"), whereupon indemnification shall be payable for the amount of such
Losses without deduction (and not merely the excess over the Basket).

  

  

(b) Cap. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 11.5:

  

  

(i) each Securityholder's aggregate liability for all claims for
indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a
Fundamental Representation, Tax Representation or an IP Representation) shall
not exceed their respective Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount;

  

  

(ii) each Securityholder's aggregate liability for (x) all claims for
indemnification described in the preceding subclause (i) and (y) all claims
for indemnification under Section 11.2(a)(i) with respect to any inaccuracy or
breach of an IP Representation, shall not exceed their respective Pro Rata
Share of the IP Indemnity Cap; and

  

  

(iii) the aggregate liability of a Securityholder for all Losses indemnifiable
under Section 11.2 (including the claims described in the preceding subclauses
(i) and (ii)) shall

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

75  

  

 

 

 

   
 

not exceed the Merger Consideration actually received by such Securityholder,
including deemed receipt of the applicable amount of the Escrow Amount and the
Expense Fund.

  

  

(c) Escrow Amount. Subject to the remaining provisions of this Section 11.5,
all claims for indemnification under Section 11.2 (Obligations of the
Securityholders to Indemnify) shall be satisfied first from the Escrow Amount
to the full extent thereof. For clarity, indemnifiable Losses under Section
11.2(a)(i) (other than with respect to a Fundamental Representation, Tax
Representation or IP Representation) shall be satisfied solely out of the
Escrow Amount and recovery against the Escrow Amount constitutes the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Buyer Indemnitees for all such Losses.

  

  

(d) Reduction for Insurance. The amount of any Losses that are subject to
indemnification under this SECTION 11 shall be reduced by the amount by which
(a) any insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party relating
to such Loss exceeds (b) the amount of expenses incurred by such Indemnified
Party in procuring such insurance recovery, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses and any increased premiums or costs as a result of such claim for
which insurance proceeds are received. This Section 11.5(d) shall not imply
and shall not be construed to imply any obligation on the part of any Person
to seek or pursue any such recovery and the failure to seek or pursue any such
recovery shall not be a defense to any indemnification obligation hereunder.

  

  

(e) Mitigation. Each party shall take commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate the Losses that any such party reasonably expects will result from an
event or circumstance for which it may seek indemnification hereunder (it
being understood that nothing herein shall limit the right to seek
indemnification hereunder with respect to any costs of such mitigation) upon
becoming aware of any such event or circumstance which would reasonably be
expected to, or does, give rise thereto; provided that the Indemnifier shall
not be required to materially alter its conduct in connection therewith.
Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve either party of any common Law or
other duty to mitigate any loss, liability or damage suffered by it.

  

  

(f) No Duplication of Recovery. Losses shall be determined without duplication
of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such Losses
constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation. To the extent that a portion of any indemnifiable
Loss is specifically included as a liability in the calculation of Net Working
Capital or the Final Adjustment Amount, then the amount specifically included
as a liability will be subtracted from the total indemnifiable Losses payable
in respect of such indemnifiable Loss. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Loss to the
extent such Loss consists of liabilities that were included in the
determination of the Merger Consideration, as adjusted by the Final Adjustment
Amount.

  

  

(g) Limitations on Tax Representations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the liability of the Securityholders for Taxes of
the Company pursuant to this Agreement, other than Taxes attributable to a
breach of the representations in Sections 2.10(f), (g), (h), (i), (j) or (k),
shall be limited to Taxes of the Company incurred in Tax periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

  

  

(h) Sole Remedy. Subject to Section (i) (Fraud), after the Effective Time, the
sole and exclusive remedy for money damages for any matter arising under this
Agreement or any certificate, document or other instrument delivered pursuant
hereto shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

(i) Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
survival periods, limitations, caps, thresholds and other provisions set forth
in this SECTION 11

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

76  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(Indemnification) shall not apply with respect to (i) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach or willful misconduct, or (ii) any
equitable remedy, including a preliminary or permanent injunction or specific
performance; provided, that no claim of fraud may be brought pursuant to this
Agreement subsequent to five (5) years after the Closing Date and any other
claim with respect to the matters in clause (i) above brought subsequent to
the five (5) years after the Closing shall be subject to the survival periods,
limitations, thresholds and other provisions set forth in this SECTION 11
(Indemnification); provided, further that the liability of a Securityholder in
respect of all claims brought pursuant to this Agreement may not exceed the
Merger Consideration actually received by the Securityholder, including deemed
receipt of the applicable amount of the Escrow Amount and Expense Fund, if
applicable, except in the case of the fraud, intentional misrepresentation,
willful breach or willful misconduct of such Securityholder. No Securityholder
shall have any liability for the fraud, intentional misrepresentation, willful
breach or willful misconduct of any other Securityholder.

  

  

(j) Merger Consideration Adjustment. The Company, Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation, the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholders agree to
treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this SECTION 11 as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law
pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

  

  

(k) Limitation of Liabilities. UNLESS SUCH DAMAGES ARE ACTUALLY PAID TO A
THIRD PARTY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SECTION 11 IN CONNECTION WITH A THIRD-
PARTY CLAIM, IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY OR OTHER PERSON
FOR (I) ANY SPECIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS AND
OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL DAMAGES OF ANY
KIND OR (II) PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
SUCH PARTY WILL BE ADVISED, WILL HAVE OTHER REASON TO KNOW, OR IN FACT WILL
KNOW OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FOREGOING.

  

  

(l) No Subrogation. Following the Closing, no Securityholder shall have any
right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries with respect to any indemnification payment made by or
on behalf of any Securityholder under Section 11.2 if the Merger and the
Transactions are consummated.

  

  

SECTION 12

  

  


 

  

  

TERMINATION

  

  

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the
other Transactions abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, regardless
of any approval by Stockholders as follows and in no other manner:

  

  

(a) by written agreement of the Company and the Buyer;

  

  

(b) by the Buyer, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under
this Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 9.1 (Compliance; Certificate) would not be
satisfied, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to the
Buyer's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the Buyer gives
the Company written notice identifying such breach, failure or
misrepresentation;

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

77  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) by the Company, if the Buyer shall have breached or failed to perform in
any material respect any of its obligations, covenants or agreements under
this Agreement, or if any of the representations and warranties of the Buyer
set forth in this Agreement shall not be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 10.1 (Compliance; Officer Certificates) would
not be satisfied, and such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured
to the Company's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the
Company gives the Buyer written notice identifying such breach, failure or
misrepresentation;

  

  

(d) by the Buyer, if the conditions set forth in SECTION 9 (Conditions to the
Obligation of Buyer and Merger Sub To Close) become incapable of satisfaction;

  

  

(e) by the Company, if the conditions set forth in SECTION 10 (Conditions to
Company's Obligation To Close) become incapable of satisfaction;

  

  

(f) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 2014 which date may be extended by mutual agreement
of the Company and the Buyer (which date shall be automatically extended on a
day-to-day basis until March 31, 2015 in the event that on each such date all
of the conditions to Closing set forth in SECTION 8, SECTION 9 and SECTION 10
are capable of satisfaction on such date or have been waived, other than the
condition in Section 8.3 because of an ongoing antitrust or competition
matter, unless, after December 31, 2014, Buyer has given notice to Company
that it is abandoning its efforts to seek such approval, in which case such
extension shall terminate upon the date of the delivery of such notice) (the
"Closing Deadline"); provided that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 12.1(f) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Closing
Deadline;

  

  

(g) by either the Buyer or the Company if: (i) any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or ruling
or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
Transactions, and such Order or ruling shall have become final and
nonappealable, or (ii) there shall be any Law enacted, promulgated or issued
or deemed applicable to the Transactions by any Governmental Entity that would
make consummation of the Transactions illegal;

  

  

(h) by the Buyer if there shall have been any action taken, final decision
made or any Law enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the
Transactions, by any Governmental Entity which would: (i) prohibit Buyer's or
the Company's or any Subsidiary's ownership or operation of any portion of the
business of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, or (ii) compel Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or the Company to dispose of or hold separate, as a
result of the Transactions, any portion of the business or assets of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates or the Company and the Subsidiaries;

  

  

(i) by the Buyer if there is a Material Adverse Effect; or

12.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 12.1 (Termination), it shall forthwith be void and have no effect,
without liability or obligation as a result of such termination on the part of
any party, its directors, officers or stockholders, except that the
Confidentiality Agreement, this Section 12.2, Section 4.7 (Confidentiality;
Potential Buyers), Section 4.10 (Public Disclosure), Section 5.3
(Confidentiality) and SECTION 13 (Miscellaneous) shall survive termination;
provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall relieve any Person
from liability for any material breach of this Agreement occurring before such
termination; provided, further that if the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

78  

  

 

 

 

   
 

Agreement is terminated under Section 12.1(b), (d), (h), (i), or (j)
subsequent to a breach of Section 4.6 (Nonsolicitation), the Company shall, in
addition to any other amounts owed by the Company hereunder, be obligated to
make a payment of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) (the "Termination Fee") in
immediately available funds to the Buyer within five (5) Business Days of
termination of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 12.2 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, that without these agreements Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 12.2 do not constitute a penalty.

13.2 Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver.

  

  

(a) This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the schedules and exhibits hereto and thereto, the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the documents and instruments and other agreements
among the parties hereto referenced herein and therein constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the Transactions, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, with respect
thereto, including the Non-Binding Memorandum of Understanding, dated June 5,
2014, other than the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, prior to the Closing, this
Agreement may be amended at any time, notwithstanding the adoption hereof by
the Stockholders, but subject to the limitations of Section 251(d) of the
DGCL, only by a written instrument signed by Buyer and the Company. Except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, after the Closing, this Agreement may be
amended at any time, only by a written instrument signed by Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative.

  

  

(c) At any time prior to the Effective Time, Buyer, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations of the other party hereto, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, or (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. From and after the Effective Time, Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Securityholder Representative, on the other, may, to the
extent legally allowed, (x) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations of the other party hereto, (y) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, or (z) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall
be valid only if, and to the extent, set forth, in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such party.

  

  

(d) This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the schedules and exhibits
hereto and thereto are not intended to confer upon any person any rights or
remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective
Time, in Section 5.4 (Director and Officer Indemnification) or SECTION 11
(Indemnification).

  

  

(e) No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests
or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other
parties, except that the Buyer may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates, so long as the Buyer remains
ultimately liable for all of the Buyer's obligations hereunder.

13.3 Governing Law; Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof, as to all matters,
including matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies.

  

  

(b) The parties (i) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the
jurisdiction of the state courts of Delaware and to the jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purpose of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement, (ii) agree not to commence any suit, action or other proceeding
arising out of or based upon this Agreement except in the state courts of
Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and
(iii) hereby waive, and agree not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense,
or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not
subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its
property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the suit,
action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of
the suit, action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the
subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court.

  

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE ESCROW AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER ANCILLARY AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS OR THE FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING TO EACH PARTY'S EXECUTION
OR PERFORMANCE OR ANY ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES OF
ANY OTHER PARTY RELATED THERETO.

  

  

(d) EACH OF THE SECURITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE, THE COMPANY, BUYER AND MERGER
SUB (1) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTIES HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS, (2) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (3) IT MAKES
SUCH WAIVERS KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY, AND (4) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE
OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 13.3.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

81  

  

 

 

 

   
 

13.4 No Prejudice. The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and the rights and remedies that may be
exercised by the Indemnified Parties based on such representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations, will not be limited or affected by any
investigation conducted by Buyer or Merger Sub or any agent of Buyer or Merger
Sub with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired)
by Buyer or Merger Sub or any agent of Buyer or Merger Sub at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with or
performance of any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, and
no Indemnified Party shall be required to show that it relied on any (and each
Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have relied on each) such representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation of the Company in order to be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11. The waiver by Buyer or Merger Sub of
any of the conditions set forth in SECTION 8 or SECTION 9 will not affect or
limit the provisions of SECTION 11.

  

  

13.5 Specific Performance and Other Remedies. Each party hereby acknowledges
that the rights of each party to consummate the Transactions and the covenants
of the parties are special, unique and of extraordinary character and that, in
the event that any party violates or fails or refuses to perform any covenant
or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching party may be without an
adequate remedy at Law. In the event that any party violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such party herein, the
non-breaching party shall be entitled, in addition to the exercise of other
remedies, to seek and (subject to court approval) obtain injunctive and other
equitable relief, without necessity of posting a bond, restraining such party
from committing such breach or threatened breach. Except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

  

  

13.6 No Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

  

  

13.7 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties and their respective successors and legal
representatives.

  

  

13.8 Construction. Whenever the context requires:

  

  

(a) the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include the masculine and feminine genders.

  

  

(b) Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not be applied in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement. The words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  

  

(c) Whenever this Agreement requires the disclosure of an agreement or
Contract on the Company Disclosure Schedule or the delivery to the Buyer of an
agreement or Contract, that disclosure requirement or delivery requirement, as
applicable, require disclosure or delivery of the entire, unredacted document
and shall also require the disclosure or delivery of each and every amendment,

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

82  

  

 

 

 

   
 

extension, exhibit, attachment, schedule, addendum, appendix, statement of
work, change order, and any other similar instrument or document relating to
that agreement or Contract.

  

  

(d) References to "Dollars" and "$" mean dollars in lawful currency of the
United States of America.

  

  

(e) All references to accounting terms shall be interpreted in accordance with
GAAP unless otherwise specified.

  

  

(f) Any reference to any party to this Agreement shall include such party's
successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(g) Any reference to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries in this Agreement
shall include any of its respective predecessor entities, including any entity
that merged with and into such predecessor entity.

  

  

(h) Except as otherwise set forth herein, the specificity of any
representation or warranty contained herein shall not be deemed to limit the
generality of any other representation or warranty contained herein.

  

  

13.9 Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
hereto in two (2) or more separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument. Any signature page delivered
by facsimile or electronic image transmission (including in the form of a PDF
file) shall be binding to the same extent as an original signature page. Any
party that delivers a signature page by facsimile or electronic image
transmission shall deliver an original counterpart to any other party that
requests such original counterpart.

  

  

13.10 Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule) are a part of this Agreement as if fully set
forth herein. All references herein to Sections, subsections, clauses,
exhibits and schedules shall be deemed references to such parts of this
Agreement, unless the context shall otherwise require.

  

  

13.11 Headings. The table of contents and the headings in this Agreement are
for reference only, and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

  

  

13.12 Expenses. Except as set forth herein, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions, including all legal, accounting, tax and
financial advisory, consulting, investment banking and all other fees and
expenses of third parties shall be the obligation of the party incurring such
fees and expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any action, claim or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements or the
enforcement of any provision thereof is brought against any party, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
costs and disbursements, in addition to any other relief to which the
prevailing party may be entitled.

  

  

13.13 Severability. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the
commission of any act contrary to Law. Should there be any conflict between
any provisions hereof and any present or future statute, Law, ordinance,
regulation, or other pronouncement having the force of Law, the latter shall
prevail, but the provision of this Agreement affected thereby shall be
curtailed and limited to the extent necessary to bring it into compliance
therewith, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

83  

  

 

 

 

   
 

13.14 No Strict Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements and
documents contemplated herein. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises under any provision of this Agreement or any other
agreement or documents contemplated herein, this Agreement and such other
agreements or documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties thereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of authoring any of the provisions of this
Agreement or any other agreements or documents contemplated herein.

  

  

13.15 Securityholder Representative.

  

  

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Securityholders and without any further action of any of the Securityholders
or the Company, (i) Fortis Advisors LLC shall serve as the Securityholder
Representative, and in such capacity as the exclusive agent and attorney-in-
fact for and on behalf of the Securityholders other than the Dissenting
Stockholders, if any (the "Securityholder Representative") and (ii) each
Securityholder (A) agrees that all actions taken by the Securityholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement shall be binding
upon such Securityholder and its successors as if expressly confirmed and
ratified in writing by such Securityholder, and (B) waives any and all
defenses which may be available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of
the Securityholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement. The Securityholder Representative shall, on behalf of
the Securityholders:

  

  

(i) take all action permitted in connection with the implementation of those
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement that require or permit
action by the Securityholder Representative;

  

  

(ii) take all action permitted in connection with the defense and/or
settlement of any and all claims for which the Securityholders may be required
to provide indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11 (Indemnification) hereof
(including rejecting, contesting, negotiating, settling and resolving any such
claims) and any claims that may be made against the Escrow Amount;

  

  

(iii) comply with Orders of courts and determinations and awards of
arbitrators with respect to claims;

  

  

(iv) review and take action with respect to Tax Returns or other Tax matters
pursuant to SECTION 6;

  

  

(v) review and take action pursuant to Sections 1.7(c) (Post-Closing True-Up)
and 1.7(d) (Resolution of Disputes) or any;

  

  

(vi) give and receive all notices and service of process required or permitted
to be given or received by the Securityholders or the Securityholder
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

  

  

(vii) execute and deliver all amendments and waivers to this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement that the Securityholder Representative deemed necessary or
appropriate, whether prior to, at or after the Closing; and

  

  

(viii) take any and all such additional action or refrain from doing any
further act or deed as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of the
Securityholders by the terms of

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

84  

  

 

 

 

   
 

this Agreement or of the Escrow Agreement or as may be necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing.

  

  

(b) All notices provided to and/or legal process served upon the
Securityholder Representative in accordance with this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement shall be deemed to be provided to and/or served upon the
Securityholders and shall be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders.
All decisions, actions, agreements, and instructions by the Securityholder
Representative, including any consent, waiver, or agreement between the
Securityholder Representative and any Buyer Indemnitee relating to the defense
or settlement of any claim for which the Securityholders may be required to
provide indemnification pursuant to SECTION 11 (Indemnification) hereof, shall
be conclusive and binding upon the Securityholders; and the Buyer, each other
Buyer Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively
thereon. The Buyer, each other Buyer Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to inquire into the authority of any person reasonably believed
to be the Securityholder Representative and no responsibility or liability for
any action or omission thereof, and no party shall have any cause of action
against the Buyer, any other Buyer Indemnitee or the Escrow Agent for any
action or omission by such party in reliance upon the instructions or
decisions of any person reasonably believed to be the Securityholder
Representative.

  

  

(c) In the event that more than one Person shall at any time serve
collectively as the Securityholder Representative, decisions of such Persons
shall, as between them and with respect to the rights of the Securityholders
in relation to the Securityholder Representative, be made by majority vote;
provided, however that they shall designate a single Person as "Securityholder
Representative" for all purposes involving the Buyer, any other Buyer
Indemnitee, or the Escrow Agent.

  

  

(d) The Securityholder Representative is authorized to act on behalf of the
Securityholders notwithstanding any dispute or disagreement among the
Securityholders. In taking any actions as Securityholder Representative, the
Securityholder Representative may rely conclusively, without any further
inquiry or investigation, upon any certification or confirmation, oral or
written, given by any person he or it reasonably believes to be authorized
thereunto. The Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely
upon the Allocation Certificate, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it
to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper
authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Securityholder or other
party. The Securityholder Representative may, in all questions arising
hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the Securityholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Securityholder for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Securityholder Representative based
on such advice. The Securityholder Representative undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement
and/or the Escrow Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement against the Securityholder
Representative and for purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the
Securityholder Representative in any other Ancillary Agreement, schedule,
exhibit or the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

  

(e) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to wire to
the Securityholder Representative the Expense Fund, which will be held by the
Securityholder Representative as agent and for the benefit of the
Securityholders and will be used for the purposes of paying any professional
fees and expenses of any attorney, accountant or other advisors retained by
the Securityholder Representative and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Securityholder Representative in connection with the
performance of the Securityholder Representative's duties under this Agreement
("Representative Expenses"). The Securityholder Representative will hold the
Expense Fund separate from its corporate funds and will not voluntarily make
it available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Securityholder
Representative is not providing any investment supervision, recommendations or
advice. The Securityholder Representative shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund other than as a result
of its gross negligence or

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

85  

  

 

 

 

   
 

willful misconduct. The Securityholder Representative is not acting as a
withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the Expense
Fund, and has no tax reporting or income distribution obligations hereunder.
As soon as reasonably determined by Securityholder Representative that the
Expense Fund is no longer required to be withheld, the Securityholder
Representative shall distribute the remaining Expense Fund (if any) to the
Escrow Agent (or directly to the Paying Agent, Buyer or Surviving Corporation,
if so instructed) for further distribution to the Securityholders.

  

  

(f) Certain Securityholders have entered into a letter agreement with the
Securityholder Representative to provide direction to the Securityholder
Representative in connection with the performance of its services under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (such Securityholders, including their
individual representatives, collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Advisory Group"). Neither the Securityholder Representative (together with
its members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees)
nor any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the "Securityholder
Representative Group"), shall have any liability to any Securityholder for any
action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Securityholder Representative Group
hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under any Securityholder
Representative engagement agreement without gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Securityholders shall, in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares, indemnify, defend and hold the Securityholder Representative
Group harmless from and against any loss, claim, damage, Tax, Liability, cost,
fee and expense (including fees, disbursements and costs of counsel and other
skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery from insurers),
judgments, fines or amounts paid in settlement that may be incurred or paid by
the Securityholder Representative arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties (except as caused by the
Securityholder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct),
including the legal costs and expenses of defending the Securityholder
Representative Group against any claim or Liability in connection with the
performance of its duties, to the extent such losses, damages, Taxes,
Liabilities and expenses exceed the Expense Fund. The Securityholders will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Expense Fund. The Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to recover from the Stockholders any
Representative Expenses reasonably incurred by the Securityholder
Representative in connection with actions taken by the Securityholder
Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
or under any Securityholder Representative engagement agreement, without the
requirement of any consent or approval by Buyer or any other Person. All of
the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Securityholder
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Merger or any
termination of this Agreement.

  

  

(g) If not paid directly to the Securityholder Representative by the
Securityholders, the Representative Expenses shall be satisfied (i) from the
Expense Fund, (ii) to the extent the amount of the Representative Expenses
exceeds the amounts then available in the Expense Fund, from any amounts
payable to the Stockholders from the Escrow Amount solely to the extent the
Securityholders would otherwise then be paid such amounts from the Escrow
Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
(as applicable) and (iii) to the extent the amount of the Representative
Expenses exceeds amounts immediately available to the Securityholder
Representative under (i) and (ii), from each Securityholder, severally and not
jointly and in proportion to its Pro Rata Share; provided that while this
section allows the Securityholder Representative to be paid from the Expense
Fund and the Escrow Amount, this does not relieve the Securityholders from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Expenses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. The
Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholder Representative shall not
be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or administration of its duties.

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

86  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(h) The Securityholder Representative shall have the power to designate its
successor hereunder. In the event that the Securityholder Representative
resigns from such position or is unable to continue in such position without
having designated a successor, Securityholders holding among them the rights
to receive at least a majority of the amount then remaining in the Escrow
Amount to be distributed to the Securityholders (or, if no Escrow Amount
remains, representing a majority in interest of the Pro Rata Shares) (the
"Majority Holders") shall promptly appoint another representative to fill such
vacancy, and such substituted representative shall be deemed to be the
Securityholder Representative for all purposes of this Agreement; provided
that a resigning Securityholder Representative shall continue to perform its
duties and obligations until its successor is appointed and has become a party
to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the absence of such
appointment, the Securityholder Representative or the Buyer may apply to a
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Securityholder Representative, and the costs, expenses and reasonable
attorneys' fees incurred in connection with such proceeding shall be paid from
the Expense Fund or, to the extent exhausted, the Securityholders. The
Securityholder Representative may be removed at any time upon the written
consent of the Majority Holders with not less than thirty (30) days' prior
written notice to the Buyer; provided however, that a successor Securityholder
Representative must be concurrently appointed and become a party to this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The immunities and rights to
indemnification shall survive the resignation or removal of Securityholder
Representative or any member of the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(i) The provisions of this Section 13.15 (including the powers, immunities and
rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholder Representative and the
Advisory Group hereunder: (i) are independent and severable, are irrevocable
and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any
rights or remedies that any Securityholder may have in connection with the
Transactions, (ii) shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence,
bankruptcy or liquidation of the respective Securityholder and shall be
binding on any successor thereto, and (iii) shall survive the delivery of an
assignment by any Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or
its interest in the Escrow Amount. Remedies available at Law for any breach of
the provisions of this Section 13.15 may be inadequate; therefore, the Buyer
and each other Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to seek temporary and
permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages or
posting any bond if such person brings an action or proceeding to enforce the
provisions of this Section 13.15.

  

  

13.16 Privilege.

  

  

(a) All communications in any form or format whatsoever between or among
Goodwin Procter LLP, on the one hand, and the Company, its Subsidiaries, the
Securityholder Representative and/or any Securityholder, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on the
other hand, if and only if such communications primarily relate to (i) the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions or (ii) any
dispute arising under this Agreement, in the case of either (i) or (ii), to
the extent that they occur prior to the Closing Date (collectively, the
"Privileged Communications") shall be deemed to be attorney-client privileged
and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto belong solely to the
Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders, shall be controlled by
the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Securityholders and shall
not pass to or be claimed by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and a third party other than the Securityholder Representative
or a Securityholder, on the other hand, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
or its Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Communications to such third party; provided,
however, that none of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In the

  

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

87  

  

 

 

 

   
 

event that Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation is legally required by governmental order or otherwise legally
required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged
Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by Law, and (y) advisable in the
opinion of Buyer's counsel, then the Buyer shall immediately (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Securityholder Representative
in writing (including by making specific reference to this Section) so that
the Securityholder Representative can seek a protective order.

  

  

(b) If and to the extent that files or other materials maintained by Goodwin
Procter LLP consist of Privileged Communications and constitute property of
its clients, only the Securityholder Representative and the Securityholders
shall hold such property rights and Goodwin Procter LLP shall have no duty to
reveal or disclose any Privileged Communications by reason of any attorney-
client relationship between Goodwin Procter LLP, on the one hand, and the
Company or its Subsidiaries, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 13.16(b) does not apply to any portion of such files or other
materials that do not consist of Privileged Communications.
