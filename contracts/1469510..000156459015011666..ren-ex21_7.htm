Article IV 
Title Matters

 

Section 4.01Examination Period. Buyer's due diligence examination shall run
from the Execution Date until December 15, 2015 at 5:00 p.m., local time in
Denver, Colorado (the "Examination Period"). During the Examination Period,
Seller shall permit Buyer or its authorized representatives to examine, during
normal business hours, in the offices of Seller, the Records and all abstracts
of title, title opinions, title files, ownership maps, lease files, contract
files, assignments, division orders and royalty accounting records pertaining
to the Assets insofar as same may be in existence and in the possession of
Seller or its Affiliates, subject to such restrictions on disclosure by Third
Parties as may exist under confidentiality agreements or other agreements
binding on Seller or such data (Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain a waiver of any such restrictions from Third Parties,
provided however, Seller shall not be required to incur any cost, expense or
other obligation in connection with obtaining such waiver). Such examination
shall be upon reasonable notice and shall not unreasonably disrupt the
personnel and operations of Seller or otherwise materially interfere with the
efforts of Seller to comply with its other obligations under this Agreement.
Any such examination by Buyer shall be at Buyer's sole cost and expense. All
information made available to Buyer, whether disclosed pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise, shall be maintained confidential by Buyer as provided
in the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 7, 2015, between Resolute
Energy Corporation and Independence Resources Management, LLC (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated into this
Agreement by this reference and made a part of this Agreement. To the extent
provided in the Confidentiality Agreement, Buyer shall take whatever
reasonable steps as may be necessary to ensure that Buyer's employees,
consultants, representatives and agents comply with the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and Buyer shall be responsible for any disclosure
or other breach of such provisions by any such Persons. Buyer shall not
contact any of the customers or suppliers of Seller or Seller's working
interest co-owners or operators, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, whether in person or by telephone, mail or
other means of communication, without the specific prior written consent of
Seller, which consent may be withheld at Seller's sole discretion. For the
purpose of this Agreement, the term "Business Day" means any calendar day
excluding Saturdays, Sundays and other days on which national banks are closed
for business in Denver, Colorado.

   

Section 4.02Defensible Title and Permitted Encumbrances.

4.04(a) or Section 4.05(d) or any other provision of this Agreement; and

 

(xvii)Title Defects that have been cured or remedied by possession under

Section 4.03Title Defect. The term "Title Defect," as used in this Agreement,
means any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity, defect in or objection to
Seller's ownership of any Asset that causes Seller not to have Defensible
Title to that Asset. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, the following matters shall not constitute, and shall not be
asserted as a Title Defect: (a) defects or irregularities arising out of lack
of corporate authorization or a variation in corporate name, unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that such corporate action or variation was not
authorized and/or results in another Person's superior claim of title to the
relevant Asset; (b) defects or irregularities that have been cured or remedied
by the passage of time, including applicable statutes of limitation and
statutes for prescription or preemption; (c) defects or irregularities in the
chain of title consisting of the failure to recite marital status in documents
or omissions of heirship proceedings; (d) defects or irregularities resulting
from or related to probate proceedings or the lack of probate proceedings if
the defects or irregularities have been outstanding for five (5) years or more
unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that such defect or irregularities
results in another Person's superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; or
(e) to the extent not triggered, conventional rights or reassignment normally
actuated by an intent to abandon or release a Lease and requiring notice to
the holders of such rights and any defect or irregularity as would normally be
waived by Persons engaged in the oil and gas business when purchasing
producing properties.

 

Section 4.04Notice of Title Defects.

 

(a)If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify
Seller of the alleged Title Defect as promptly as reasonably possible,
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to provide weekly updates
with respect to Title Defects, but no later than the expiration of the
Examination Period. To be effective, this notice (a "Title Defect Notice")
must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by Seller prior to the expiration of
the Examination Period; (iii) describe the Title Defect in sufficient,
specific detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest or
Working Interest); (iv) identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by the
Title Defect; and (v) include the value of the Title Defect as determined by
Buyer. Any matters that otherwise may have constituted Title Defects, but
that are not so described in a timely Title Defect Notice complying and
delivered in accordance with this Section 4.04(a), shall be deemed to have
been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted
Encumbrances. The foregoing sentence shall not constitute a waiver of

   

Buyer's rights under (A) Section 16.04(b) or (B) the special warranty of title
contained in the Assignment.

 

(b)After receipt of an effective Title Defect Notice, Seller shall have the
option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure the Title Defect at
Seller's sole cost and expense.

 

(c)The value attributable to each Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value") that
is asserted by Buyer in a Title Defect Notice shall be determined in good
faith based upon the criteria set forth below:

 

(i)If the Title Defect is a lien on any Asset, the Title Defect Value is the
amount necessary to be paid to remove the lien from the affected Asset.

 

(ii)If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable
to any Well is less than that stated in Exhibit B and there is a proportionate
decrease in the Working Interest attributable to such Well stated in Exhibit
B, then the Title Defect Value shall be the product of the Allocated Value of
such Asset, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the difference
between the Net Revenue Interest set forth in Exhibit B and the actual Net
Revenue Interest, and the denominator of which is the Net Revenue Interest
stated in Exhibit B. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Allocated
Value" means, with respect to any Asset, the amount allocated to that Asset
under Section 11.01.

 

(iii)If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance, burden or
charge on the affected Asset (including any increase in Working Interest for
which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest or any
decrease in the Net Revenue Interest attributable to any Future Well) for
which the economic detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title
Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of
the affected Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the
legal effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of
the Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, the probability that a
potential title failure will result in an actual title failure, the Title
Defect Value placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller, and any such
other reasonable factors as are necessary to make a proper evaluation.

 

(iv)If a Title Defect is not in effect, affects only certain depths, or does
not adversely affect an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such
Asset, the consequences of that fact shall be taken into account in
determining the Title Defect Value.

 

(v)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Title
Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without duplication of any
costs or losses included in another Title Defect Value.

 

(vi)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the Wells, units,
Future Wells or other Assets affected by it.

   

Section 4.05Remedies for Title Defects.

 

(a)If Seller elects to attempt to cure any Title Defect pursuant to Section
4.04(b), but is unable to do so prior to Closing, the affected Assets shall
nevertheless be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, the Purchase Price at Closing
shall be adjusted downward by the Title Defect Value of the applicable Title
Defect, and Buyer shall pay (i) an amount equal to such Title Defect Value to
the Escrow Agent at Closing, and (ii) if the Allocated Value exceeds the Title
Defect Value, an amount equal to the difference between the Allocated Value
and the Title Defect Value to Seller at Closing. If Seller cures the
applicable Title Defect on or before the date that is sixty (60) days after
the date Buyer delivered the respective Title Defect Notice to Seller pursuant
to Section 4.04(a) (provided however, that if Buyer materially supplements or
modifies such Title Defect Notice prior to the Defect Notice Date, such sixty
(60) day period shall run from the date of such supplement or modification),
then the Parties shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release the Title
Defect Value to Seller. If Seller elects to cure a Title Defect so as to
remove the Title Defect pursuant to this Section 4.05(a) but is unable to do
so within the time period set forth in this Section 4.05(a), then the Parties
shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release an amount equal to the
Title Defect Value to Buyer.

 

(b)Subject to Seller's right to cure a Title Defect after Closing pursuant to
Section 4.05(a) and the continuing right of Seller to dispute the existence of
an asserted Title Defect or the asserted Title Defect Value, pursuant to
Section 4.05(c), and subject to the rights of the Parties under Section 9.04
or Section 10.04, if any Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer in accordance
with Section 4.04(a) is not waived in writing by Buyer or cured on or before
Closing, the Parties shall mutually agree to:

 

(i)subject to Section 4.05(d), reduce the Purchase Price by the Title Defect
Value for the Title Defect as determined in accordance with Section 4.04(c) or
Article XVIII (which reduction shall cause such asserted Title Defect to
become an Assumed Obligation under Section 16.02);

 

(ii)have Seller indemnify Buyer against all claims resulting from the Title
Defect (an "Indemnified Title Defect") pursuant to an indemnity agreement (the
"Title Indemnity Agreement") in a form mutually agreeable to the Parties; or

 

(iii)have Seller retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to the Title
Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of the Asset and
the associated Assets;

 

provided, however, that if the Parties cannot mutually agree on a remedy for a
Title Defect prior to Closing, then the Parties shall be deemed to have
elected the remedy set forth in Section 4.05(b)(i) with respect to such Title
Defect.

 

(c)If at or before the Closing, Buyer and Seller have not agreed on the
validity of any asserted Title Defect or the Title Defect Value attributable
to the Title Defect, Buyer or Seller shall have the right to elect to have the
Dispute regarding the validity of the Title Defect or the Title Defect Value
determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with

   

Article XVIII. In that event, the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall be
reduced with respect to the disputed Title Defect or Title Defect Value, in
each case, in an amount equal to the average of the Title Defect Value
proposed by Buyer in Buyer's Title Defect Notice and the Title Defect Value
determined by Seller in good faith, and Buyer shall pay such amount to the
Escrow Agent at Closing. Upon the final resolution of the Dispute, the
Parties shall promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to release such amount
(together with interest accrued thereon) to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, in
accordance with the resolution of the Dispute, within five (5) Business Days
of such resolution.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if the
value of a particular individual Title Defect does not exceed $50,000, then no
adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for the Title Defect, (ii) if
the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with
this Agreement for the difference between all Title Defects (each exceeding
$50,000) less all Title Benefits (each exceeding $50,000) does not exceed one
and one quarter percent (1.25%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, then no
adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made on account of Title Defects,
and (iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in
accordance with this Agreement for the difference between all Title Defects
(each exceeding $50,000) less all Title Benefits (each exceeding $50,000) does
exceed one and one quarter percent (1.25%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price,
then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted only by the amount of the excess.

 

Section 4.06Special Warranty of Title. The documents to be executed and
delivered by Seller to Buyer transferring title to the Assets as required
hereby, including the Assignment and Bill of Sale attached hereto as Exhibit D
(the "Assignment"), shall provide for a special warranty of title warranting
title by, through and under Seller and/or its Affiliates, but not otherwise,
subject to the Permitted Encumbrances. 

 

Section 4.07Preferential Rights To Purchase.

 

(a)With respect to each preferential right to purchase, right of first
refusal, or similar provisions relative to any Asset (each a "PPR") within
five (5) Business Days following the Execution Date, Seller shall send to the
holder of each such PPR a notice in compliance with the contractual provisions
applicable to such PPR requesting a waiver of such PPR. Unless otherwise
provided in the instrument creating the PPR, such PPR must be exercised
subject to all terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. Seller shall
use reasonable efforts, but without any obligation to incur any additional
cost or expense, to comply with all PPRs prior to the Closing. From time to
time, and in any event prior to the Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer of the
existence of any known PPRs and if any PPRs are exercised or if the requisite
period has elapsed without said rights having been exercised. 

 

(b)If, as of the Closing Date, a Third-Party holder of a PPR has timely and
properly notified Seller that it elects to exercise its PPR with respect to
the Assets to which its PPR applies (determined by and in accordance with the
agreement in which the PPR arises) or if the time for exercising such PPR has
not expired, then the Assets covered by such PPR will not be sold to the Party
originally executing this Agreement as "Buyer" (subject to the remaining
provisions in this Article) and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced
by the Allocated Value of such Assets. Subject to Buyer's rights under
Section 13.01(d), Buyer shall remain

   

obligated to purchase the remainder of the Assets not affected by an exercised
PPR. Upon the consummation of the sale of any Assets to the holder of such
PPR, any such Assets shall be deemed for all purposes to constitute "Excluded
Assets".

 

(c)Within ninety (90) days following the Closing, if for any reason the
purchase and sale of the Assets covered by a PPR exercised prior to Closing
(or after Closing if the time for exercising such PPR had not expired prior to
Closing) under (b) above is not or cannot be consummated with the holder of
the PPR that exercised its PPR or the time for exercising such PPR expires
without exercise by the holder thereof, then Seller shall so notify Buyer and
within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller
shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept
from Seller such Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the
Allocated Value of such Assets (except the Closing Date with respect to such
Assets will be the date of assignment of such Assets from Seller to Buyer) as
adjusted pursuant to Article XII with respect to such Assets.

 

(d)All Assets for which any applicable PPR has been waived or as to which the
period to exercise the applicable PPR has expired (and such PPR has not been
exercised), in each case, prior to Closing shall be sold to Buyer at Closing
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 4.08Consents to Assignment.

 

(a)With respect to each consent necessary to assign the Assets, within five
(5) Business Days following the Execution Date, Seller shall send to the
holder of each such consent a notice in compliance with the contractual
provisions applicable to such consent seeking such holder's consent to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall use reasonable
efforts, but without any obligation to incur any material out-of-pocket cost
or expense, to obtain all necessary consents from Third Parties to assign the
Assets prior to the Closing (other than approvals of any relevant Governmental
Authority that are customarily obtained after the Closing), and Buyer shall
use its reasonable efforts (without the obligation to incur any expenses) to
assist Seller with those efforts. If the holder of any consent requires that
the Buyer deliver proof of its creditworthiness for the approval of such
consent, then the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller and the holder
of such consent and deliver to such holder any reasonably-requested credit or
other information concerning the business, operations, property, condition
(financial or otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of Buyer. 

 

(b)To the extent (i) any such consents are not obtained prior to Closing and
an express provision of the document providing for the consent would (A)
render the assignment of some or all of the Assets void or voidable, (B) give
rise to a claim for specified liquidated damages, (C) cause the termination of
the Lease or other Asset to be assigned as a result of the failure to obtain
that consent, (D) cause a violation of a maintenance of uniform interest
provision, (E) prevent Buyer from participating, in any material respect, in
the exploration, drilling, development and production operations, with respect
to the Assets affected by the instrument for which the consent was required or
(F) be required from a Governmental Authority (other than a Customary Post-
Closing Consent) (in each case, a "Required Consent") or (ii) such consent was
denied in writing, then, in each case, the Assets affected by such unobtained
Required Consent or consent denied in writing shall be excluded from the
Assets to be assigned

   

to Buyer at Closing and the Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Assets as adjusted pursuant to Article XII with
respect to such Assets. 

 

(c)Within ninety (90) days following the Closing, if any Required Consent not
obtained under (b) above is obtained, then Seller shall so notify Buyer and
within ten (10) Business Days after Buyer's receipt of such notice, Seller
shall sell, assign and convey to Buyer and Buyer shall purchase and accept
from Seller such Assets pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and for the
Allocated Value of such Assets (except the Closing Date with respect to such
Assets will be the date of assignment of such Assets from Seller to Buyer) as
adjusted pursuant to Article XII with respect to such Assets.

 

Section 4.09Title Benefits; Remedies.

 

(a)If Seller discovers, or Buyer obtains actual knowledge of, any Title
Benefit during the Examination Period affecting the Assets, it shall promptly
notify the other Party at or before the expiration of the Examination Period.
Seller shall be entitled to offset the value of any Title Benefit that exceeds
$50,000 against those Title Defect Values that exceed $50,000. The value of
any Title Benefit shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties. For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "Title Benefit" means the Seller's interest in any
Asset that is greater than or in addition to that set forth in Exhibit B,
including a Net Revenue Interest that is greater than that set forth in
Exhibit B or Seller's Working Interest in any Asset that is less than the
Working Interest set forth in Exhibit B (without a corresponding decrease in
the Net Revenue Interest).

 

(b)If, with respect to a Title Benefit, Buyer and Seller have not agreed on
such amount at or prior to the Closing, Seller or Buyer shall have the right
to elect to have the Dispute regarding the amount of the Title Benefit
determined by an Independent Expert in accordance with Article XVIII. 

 

Article V 
Environmental Matters

 

Section 5.01Environmental Review.

 

(a)Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant reasonably
acceptable to Seller ("Buyer's Environmental Consultant") to conduct an
environmental review of the Assets prior to the expiration of the Examination
Period (or such longer period as set forth in this Section 5.01) ("Buyer's
Environmental Review"). The cost and expense of Buyer's Environmental Review,
if any, shall be borne solely by Buyer. The scope of work comprising Buyer's
Environmental Review shall be limited to a Phase I review and otherwise as may
be agreed by Buyer and Seller prior to commencement. The Environmental Review
shall not include any intrusive test, sampling, boring, or procedure without
the prior written consent of Seller. If Buyer's Phase I review provides a
reasonable basis for conducting a Phase II review or any other invasive review
with respect to any Asset and Seller does not consent to such requested
invasive review, then Buyer shall have the option to exclude such Asset from
the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing (and the Unadjusted Purchase
Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such Assets as adjusted
pursuant to Article XII with respect to such Asset). If

   

Buyer's Phase I review provides a reasonable basis for conducting a Phase II
review or any other invasive review with respect to any Asset and Seller
consents to such requested invasive review, then Buyer shall have 30 days from
such consent to complete its requested invasive review, provided that if
Buyer's review is not completed prior to Closing, then such Asset will be
excluded from the Assets to be assigned to Buyer at Closing (and the
Unadjusted Purchase Price will be reduced by the Allocated Value of such
Assets as adjusted pursuant to Article XII with respect to such Asset).
Following Buyer's completion of its invasive review, any Environmental Defect
with respect to such Asset shall be resolved (and such Asset retained or
conveyed) in accordance with this Article V, with Seller having ten days to
attempt to cure such Environmental Defect prior to the Parties electing among
the remedies set forth in Section 5.04(a) and (b). Buyer shall, and shall

conducting any work comprising Buyer's Environmental Review, (ii) perform all
such work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably
interfere with the operation of the Assets and (iii) comply with all
applicable Laws. Buyer shall be solely responsible for obtaining any consents
from a Third Party that are required to perform any work comprising Buyer's
Environmental Review, and Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to requesting
each such consent. Seller shall have the right to have a representative or
representatives accompany Buyer and Buyer's Environmental Consultant at all
times during Buyer's Environmental Review. With respect to any samples taken
in connection with Buyer's Environmental Review, Buyer shall take split
samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified,
to Seller without charge. Buyer releases, and shall defend, indemnify and
hold harmless, Seller Indemnitees from and against all Losses (INCLUDING THOSE
RESULTING FROM SELLER'S SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR
STRICT LIABILITY, BUT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLER'S
GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AND ANY MATTERS EXISTING PRIOR TO
CONDUCTING SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW) arising out of, related to, or caused by
Buyer's Environmental Review.

 

(b)Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause
Buyer's Environmental Consultant to, treat any matters revealed by Buyer's
Environmental Review and any reports or data generated from such review (the
"Environmental Information"), in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Environmental Information to Seller, which
Environmental Information shall become the sole property of Seller without
charge.

 

(c)Upon completion of Buyer's Environmental Review, Buyer shall, at its sole
cost and expense and without any cost or expense to the Seller Indemnitees (i)
repair all damage done to the Assets in connection with any Buyer's
Environmental Review, (ii) restore the Assets to the same or better condition
in existence prior to commencement of any Buyer's Environmental Review, and
(iii) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Assets in
connection with any Buyer's Environmental Review.

Section 5.02Environmental Definitions.

 

(a)Assumed Environmental Obligations. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "Assumed Environmental Obligations" means all Losses related to the
operation of the Assets or the condition of the Assets and any surface or
subsurface depths used or affected in connection with the Assets, including
any pooled, communitized or unitized acreage by virtue of the Assets being a

prior to, on, or after the Effective Time, including the cost of correcting
such violations or noncompliance and any fines or penalties arising out of
such violations or noncompliance; (ii) the release, discharge or disposal of

(b)Environmental Defects. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Defect" means an environmental condition identified with
specificity in Buyer's Environmental Review that constitutes a violation of
Environmental Laws in effect as of the Execution Date in the jurisdiction in
which the affected Assets are located, excluding, however (i) any
environmental conditions that do not exceed the threshold and deductible
values in Section 5.04(c) and (ii) any environmental conditions that are
listed on Schedule 5.02(a), in each case, which environmental conditions shall
be deemed not to constitute Environmental Defects, but which shall nonetheless
be Assumed Environmental Obligations.

 

(c)Environmental Defect Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Environmental Defect Value" means, with respect to any Environmental Defect,
the value, as of the Closing Date, of the estimated costs and expenses to
correct the Environmental Defect, in the most prudent manner reasonably

non-permanent remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous
Substances, including monitoring site conditions, natural attenuation, risk-
based corrective action, institutional controls or other appropriate
restrictions on the use of property, caps, dikes, encapsulations, leachate
collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost-effective manner reasonably
available, (ii) the continuing long-term need to operate the Asset, (iii)
customary industry practices, (iv) the net present value of such Environmental
Condition, and (v) the requirements of Environmental Laws.

 

(d)"Environmental Laws" means all Laws pertaining to health (as relates to
exposure to Hazardous Substances), the environment, wildlife or natural
resources, or the use, storage, emission, discharge, clean-up, release, or

Section 5.03Notice of Environmental Defects. If Buyer discovers any
Environmental Defect affecting any Asset, Buyer shall notify Seller of the
alleged Environmental Defect as promptly as possible, but no later than the
expiration of the Examination Period. To be effective, such notice (an
"Environmental Defect Notice") must (i) be in writing; (ii) be received by
Seller prior to the expiration of the Examination Period; (iii) describe the
Environmental Defect in sufficient, specific detail, including (A) the written
conclusion of Buyer's Environmental Consultant that an Environmental Defect
exists, which conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated by the factual data
gathered in Buyer's Environmental Review; and (B) a separate specific citation
of the provisions of Environmental Laws alleged to be violated and the related
facts that substantiate such violation; (iv) identify the specific Asset or
Assets affected by the Environmental Defect; and (v) state Buyer's estimate of
the Environmental Defect Value, including the basis for such estimate, for
which Buyer would agree to adjust the Purchase Price to accept such
Environmental Defect if the Parties elect Section 5.04(a)(i) as the remedy for
it. Any matters that may otherwise have constituted Environmental Defects,
but that are not so described in a timely Environmental Defect Notice
complying with this Section 5.03, together with any environmental matter that
does not constitute an Environmental Defect, shall be deemed to have been
waived by Buyer for all purposes and constitute an Assumed Obligation. The
foregoing sentence shall not constitute a waiver of Buyer's rights under (A)
Section 16.04(a), (B) Section 16.04(b) with respect to any breach by Seller of
Section 6.20 or (C) Section 16.04(c) with respect to any breach by Seller of
Section 15.01. After receipt of an effective Environmental Defect Notice,
Seller shall have the option, but not the obligation, to attempt to cure the
Environmental Defect at any time prior to the Closing.

 

Section 5.04Remedies for Environmental Defects.

 

(a)Subject to the continuing right of Seller to dispute the existence of an
asserted Environmental Defect or the asserted Environmental Defect Value and
subject to the rights of the Parties under Section 13.01(d), if any
Environmental Defect timely asserted by

   

Buyer in accordance with Section 5.03 is not waived in writing by Buyer or
cured on or before Closing, the Parties shall mutually agree to:

 

(i)subject to Section 5.04(c), reduce the Purchase Price by the Environmental
Defect Value for the Environmental Defect as determined in accordance with
Section 5.02(c) or Article XVIII (which reduction shall cause such alleged
Environmental Defect to become an Assumed Obligation under Section 16.02);

 

(ii)have Seller indemnify Buyer against all claims resulting from the
Environmental Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement (the "Environmental
Indemnity Agreement") in a form mutually agreeable to the Parties; or

 

(iii)have Seller retain the entirety of the Asset that is subject to such
Environmental Defect, together with all associated Assets, in which event the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Allocated Value of
the Asset and the associated Assets.

 

provided, however, that if the Parties cannot mutually agree on a remedy for
an Environmental Defect, then they shall be deemed to have elected the remedy
set forth in Section 5.04(a)(iii) with respect to such Environmental Defect.

 

(b)If at or before the Closing Buyer and Seller have not agreed on the
validity of any asserted Environmental Defect or the Environmental Defect
Value attributable to the Environmental Defect, Buyer or Seller shall have the
right to elect to have the Dispute regarding the validity of the Environmental
Defect or the Environmental Defect Value determined by an Independent Expert
in accordance with Article XVIII. In that event, the Purchase Price paid at
Closing shall be reduced with respect to the disputed Environmental Defect or
Environmental Defect Value, in each case, in an amount equal to the lesser of
(i) the average of the Environmental Defect Value proposed by Buyer in Buyer's
Environmental Defect Notice and the Environmental Defect Value determined by
Seller in good faith, and (ii) the Allocated Value of such Asset, and Buyer
shall pay such amount to the Escrow Agent at Closing. Upon the final
resolution of the Dispute, the Parties shall promptly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release such amount (together with interest accrued thereon) to Buyer
or Seller, as applicable, in accordance with the resolution of the Dispute,
within five (5) Business Days of such resolution.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) if the
Environmental Defect Value for a particular individual Environmental Defect
does not exceed $50,000, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be
made for the Environmental Defect, (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the
Purchase Price determined in accordance with this Agreement for Environmental
Defects (each exceeding $50,000) does not exceed one and one quarter percent
(1.25%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, then no adjustment of the Purchase
Price shall be made on account of Environmental Defects, and (iii) if the
aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in accordance with this
Agreement for Environmental Defects (each exceeding $50,000) does exceed one
and one quarter percent (1.25%) of the Unadjusted Purchase Price, then the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted only by the amount of the excess.

   

Section 5.05No Warranty Regarding Environmental Matters. EXCEPT AS SET FORTH
IN SECTION 6.20 and subject to Buyer's rights under (i) Section 16.04(a), (ii)
Section 16.04(b) with respect to any breach by Seller of Section 6.20 or the
Closing certificate delivered by Seller and (iii) Section 16.04(c) with
respect to any breach by Seller of Section 15.01, SELLER WILL CONVEY THE
ASSETS TO BUYER WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS OR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED, NOT EVEN FOR
RETURN OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. SUBJECT TO BUYER'S RIGHTS under (A) Section
13.01(d), (B) SECTION 16.04(A), (C) sECTION 16.04(B) WITH RESPECT TO A BREACH
OF SECTION 6.20 and (D) Section 16.04(c) with respect to any breach by Seller
of Section 15.01, BUYER'S SOLE REMEDY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECTS OR OTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFECT PROCEDURE UNDER THIS ARTICLE
V.

 

Section 5.06NORM. Buyer acknowledges that some oilfield production equipment
comprising the Assets may contain asbestos or naturally occurring radioactive
material ("NORM"). In this regard, Buyer specifically acknowledges that NORM
may affix or attach itself to the inside of wellbores, materials and equipment
as scale or in other forms, and that wells, materials and equipment comprising
the Assets or located on a Lease may contain NORM and that NORM containing
materials may have been disposed of on a Lease. Buyer expressly understands
that special procedures may be required for the removal and disposal of
asbestos and NORM from the Assets if and where they may be found, and Buyer
assumes Seller's liability for or in connection with the assessment,
remediation, removal, transportation or disposal of any such materials present
on the Assets at or after the Effective Time in accordance with all
requirements of any Governmental Authority (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM
SELLER'S SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
LIABILITY).

 

Article VI 
Representations and Warranties of Seller

 

Seller represents and warrants to Buyer that:

 

Section 6.01Seller's Existence. Seller is a limited liability company duly
formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of

(i)any provision of Seller's organizational or other governing documents;

 

(ii)assuming the receipt of all waivers of any preferential purchase rights
and consents to assignment (including Customary Post-Closing Consents), any
material agreement or instrument to which Seller is a party or by which Seller
is bound that affects any of the Assets; or

 

(iii)any judgment, order, ruling or decree applicable to Seller as a party in
interest or any Law applicable to Seller's interest in any of the Assets; and
.

 

(b)other than any Required Consent, will not result in the creation of any
encumbrance on any Asset or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation, or acceleration under any of provision of any Lease or Contract
to which Seller is a party (relating to the Assets) or by which any of the
Assets may be bound.

 

Section 6.03Execution. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement has been, and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party will
be, duly and validly authorized by the requisite limited liability action, as
applicable, on the part of Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller (and all Transaction Documents this Agreement requires be
executed and delivered by Seller at Closing will be duly executed and
delivered by Seller) and this Agreement constitutes (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer), and at the Closing the
Transaction Documents to which Seller is a party will constitute (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Buyer, if Buyer is a party thereto),
the valid and binding obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in
accordance with their terms except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy or other similar Laws affecting the rights and remedies
of creditors generally as well as to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law).

 

Section 6.04Brokers. No broker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or
finder's fee, or to any commission, based in any way on agreements,
arrangements or understandings made by or on behalf of Seller or any Affiliate

satisfy any such judgments promptly in accordance with their terms (taking
into account the maximum probable amount of such judgments in any such actions
and the earliest reasonable time at which such judgments might be rendered) as
well as all other obligations of Seller. The cash available to Seller, after
taking into account all other anticipated uses of the cash, will be sufficient
to pay all such debts and judgments promptly in accordance with their terms.

 

(c)To the Knowledge of the Seller, the Assets contemplated to be transferred,
conveyed and sold by Seller pursuant to the terms set forth in this Agreement
and in the Assignment are being sold for reasonably equivalent value.

 

(d)There are no bankruptcy, reorganization, or similar arrangement proceedings
pending, being contemplated by or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened against
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller.

 

Section 6.06Proceedings. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.06, there is no
suit, action, claim, investigation or inquiry by any Person or entity or by
any administrative agency or Governmental Authority and no legal,
administrative or arbitration proceeding, (in each case) that is pending or,
to Seller's Knowledge, threatened against Seller or any Affiliate of Seller
(a) with respect to the Assets, or any of them, or Seller's ownership or
operation thereof or (b) that has materially affected or will materially
affect Seller's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

Laws or relating to Taxes, which are addressed exclusively under Article V,
Section 6.20 and Section 6.08, respectively. 

 

Section 6.07Royalties. To Seller's Knowledge, during the Seller Ownership

of the Asset and ending at the Closing. 

 

Section 6.08Taxes. Except as set forth on Schedule 6.08, (a) all Tax Returns
relating to or in connection with Seller's acquisition, ownership or operation
of the Assets required to be filed have been timely filed and all such Tax
Returns are correct and complete in all respects, (b) all Taxes based on or
measured by the ownership of the Assets or the production of Hydrocarbons or
the receipt of proceeds of production that have become due and payable
(whether or not shown on such Tax Returns) have been paid in full prior to
becoming delinquent, except for such Taxes that are being contested in good
faith and are set forth in Schedule 6.08,

between Seller and any other Persons, whether owning undivided interests
therein or otherwise, that is treated as or constitutes a partnership for
federal or state income Tax purposes, and in the case of any such Asset that
is scheduled on Schedule 6.08(h), the partnership has in effect a valid
election under Section 754 of the Code. Seller is a disregarded entity as
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii). For U.S. tax
purposes (including Section 1445), Resolute Parent will be the transferor of
the property and not the Seller. Resolute Parent is neither (i) a "foreign
person" within the meaning of Section 1445 of the Code, or (ii) an entity
disregarded as separate from any other Person within the meaning of Section
301.7701-3(a) of the regulations promulgated by the United States Department
of Treasury pursuant to and in respect of provisions of the Code. 

 

Section 6.09Contracts.

 

(a)All Contracts material to the ownership or operation of the Assets are

(iii)any Hydrocarbon purchase and sale, gathering, transportation, processing
or similar Contract unless terminable by either party without penalty on 30

communitizing or unitizing agreement or order; and

 

(xiii)any Contract that is a seismic or other geophysical acquisition
agreement or license that will be binding on Buyer after the Closing.

 

(b)Copies of all such Material Contracts (and any amendments thereto) have
been made available by Seller to Buyer prior to the Execution Date. 

 

(c)All Material Contracts (i) are in full force and effect, and (ii) Seller is
not (and has not been claimed in writing to be) in default or otherwise in
breach with respect to any of its material obligations under any of such
Material Contracts and, to Seller's Knowledge, no other Person is in default

under such Material Contracts. Except for such matters that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, no event has

default under any such Material Contract by Seller or, to Seller's Knowledge,
by any other Person who is a party to such Material Contract.

operator. This Section 6.11 shall not be deemed to include any matters
arising under Environmental Laws or relating to Taxes, which are addressed
exclusively under Article V, Section 6.20 and Section 6.08, respectively.

 

Section 6.12No Prepayments. There have been no advance, take or pay or other

agreements or operations relating to the Assets, except as set forth in
Schedule 6.13, there are no outstanding calls or payments in excess of

payments relating to the Assets which are due or which Seller has committed to
make which have not been made or that relate to the period from and after the
Effective Time. 

 

Section 6.14Suspense Revenues. Except as set forth in Schedule 6.14, Seller
does not hold (in escrow or otherwise) any third-Person funds in suspense with
respect to production of Hydrocarbons from any of the Assets. All funds

Section 6.17Wells. There are no Wells included in the Assets in respect of
which Seller or any of its Affiliates (or to Seller's Knowledge, any Third
Party operator) has received an unresolved order from any Governmental
Authority requiring that such wells be plugged and abandoned. All plugged and
abandoned wells that have been plugged and abandoned by Seller (or, to
Seller's Knowledge, any Third Party operator) have been plugged and abandoned
in

   

compliance in all material respects with applicable Laws. All Wells included
in the Assets that have been drilled and completed by Seller (or to Seller's
Knowledge, by any Third Party operator) have been drilled and completed within
the limits permitted by all applicable Leases and pooling or unit agreements
or orders. Schedule 6.17 sets forth all shut-in, temporarily abandoned or
other inactive Wells located on the lands covered by the Subject Interests or
on lands with which the Subject Interests may have been pooled, communitized
or unitized.

compliance by Seller or the Assets with any Environmental Law or the terms of
any permits, licenses, orders, approvals, variances, waivers, franchises,
rights or other authorizations issued pursuant thereto; or (ii) gives rise to
or results in any common law or other liability of Seller to any Person which,
in the case of either clause (i) or (ii) hereof, would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

law).

 

Section 7.04Brokers. No broker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or

Article XI

 

Purchase Price Allocation and Tax Matters

 

Section 11.01Purchase Price Allocation.

 

(a)The Unadjusted Purchase Price has been allocated among the Assets by Buyer
as set forth in Exhibit B. Buyer represents that the Allocated Values
constitute reasonable and good faith allocations of the Unadjusted Purchase
Price among the Assets. Seller and Buyer agree that the Allocated Values
shall be used to compute any adjustments to the Unadjusted Purchase Price
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b)Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, under Section 1060 of the Code (and any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate), Buyer and
Seller must report information regarding the allocation of the Unadjusted
Purchase Price (as adjusted by the Purchase Price Adjustments and plus Assumed
Obligations, to the extent properly taken into account under the Code) to the
United States Secretary of Treasury by attaching Department of Treasury,
Internal Revenue Service, Form 8594 to their federal income Tax Returns for
the Tax period which includes the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
and Seller will mutually agree regarding the allocation of the Purchase Price
(plus Assumed Obligations, to the extent properly taken into account under the
Code) (the "Allocation Schedule") and shall prepare their respective Forms
8594 with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule. The Allocation Schedule shall
be delivered by Seller to Buyer no fewer than 10 days prior to the Closing for
Buyer's approval. Seller and Buyer shall work in good faith to resolve any
disputes relating to the Allocation Schedule within 5 days. If Seller and
Buyer are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be resolved
promptly by a nationally recognized accounting firm acceptable to Buyer and
Seller, the costs of which shall be borne by equally. The Allocation Schedule
shall be prepared consistent with the Allocated Values set forth in Exhibit B
and shall be revised to take into account the Purchase Price Adjustments
(including pursuant to Section 11.04(b)) consistent with the provisions set
forth in this Section 11.01. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall take any position
inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule, on any income Tax Return or
otherwise, unless required to do so by applicable Law or a "determination,"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Seller from settling any
proposed deficiency or adjustment by any taxing authority based upon or
arising out of such allocation, and neither Buyer nor Seller shall be required
to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
taxing authority challenging such allocation.

 

Section 11.02Transfer Taxes. Buyer shall be responsible for the timely payment
of, and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller (and its members,
managers, officers, employees and agents) from and against, all Transfer
Taxes, if any. Buyer shall prepare and file when due all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes;
provided, however, that Seller shall cooperate with Buyer and take any action
reasonably requested by Buyer that does not cause Seller to incur any cost or
inconvenience to minimize any such Transfer Taxes. Any Transfer Taxes imposed
on or paid by Seller shall be promptly

   

reimbursed to Seller by Buyer upon written demand therefor. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term "Transfer Taxes" means any and all Taxes (excluding
Taxes measured in whole or in part by net income), including sales, use,
excise, stock, conveyance, gross receipts, registration, business and
occupation, securities transactions, real estate, stamp, documentary,
notarial, filing, recording, permit, license, authorization and similar Taxes,
fees, duties, levies, customs, tariffs, imposts, assessments, obligations and
charges arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including any and all professional costs associated with them
and the preparation and filing of their Tax Returns. 

 

Section 11.03Severance and Property Taxes. For purposes of this Agreement,

 

(a)Taxes that are attributable to the severance or production of Hydrocarbons,
including severance, production, and excise Taxes, and utility fees based on
volumes of hydrocarbons gathered, or that are imposed on a transactional basis
(together, "Severance Taxes"), shall be deemed attributable to the period
during which the production of the Hydrocarbons or the transaction with
respect to such Taxes occurred, as applicable, and liability therefor shall be
shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer as of the Effective Time as if
the Tax period ended immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the portion
of Severance Taxes attributable to the period ending immediately prior to the
Effective Time being allocated to Seller, and the portion of the Severance
Taxes attributable to the period beginning on the Effective Time being
allocated to Buyer, in each case without duplicating any adjustment to the
Purchase Price required by Section 12.02. Seller shall, in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations, pay or withhold or cause to be paid or
withheld all such Taxes that have accrued with respect to production prior to
Closing and shall file all statements, returns, and documents incident
thereto. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all such Taxes that accrue with
respect to production from Closing onward and shall file all statements,
returns, and documents incident thereto. If any Severance Taxes allocated to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.03(a) are actually paid by Seller, then,
after Closing, and to the extent such Severance Taxes are not taken into
account in Section 12.02, and upon written request by Seller, Buyer shall,
within fifteen (15) Business Days of such request, make a payment to Seller of
the amount of any Severance Taxes paid by Seller but allocated to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 11.03(a). If any Severance Taxes allocated to Seller
pursuant to this Section 11.03(a) are actually paid by Buyer, then, after
Closing, and to the extent such Severance Taxes are not taken into account in
Section 12.02, and upon written request by Buyer, Seller shall, within fifteen
(15) Business Days of such request, make a payment to Buyer of the amount of
any Severance Taxes paid by Buyer but allocated to Seller pursuant to this
Section 11.03(a). For Tax periods in which the Effective Time occurs, Seller
agrees to forward to Buyer copies of any Severance Tax reports and returns
received by Seller after Closing and to provide Buyer with any information
Seller has that is necessary for Buyer to file any required Production Tax
reports and returns related to the Assets, which Severance Tax returns and
reports Buyer agrees to file.

 

(b)All ad valorem, property, and similar Taxes ("Property Taxes") with respect
to the Assets assessed with respect to a period which begins before, and ends
after, the Effective Time (including such Taxes levied for the 2015 Tax year)
shall be prorated based on the number of days in such period through the day
in which the Effective Time occurs and the number of days in such period that
occur after such day, with the portion of the Property Taxes attributable to
the period ending on the day in which the Effective Time occurs being
allocated to

   

Seller, and the portion of the Property Taxes attributable to the period
beginning on the day after the day in which the Effective Time occurs being
allocated to Buyer, in each case without duplicating any adjustment to the
Purchase Price required by Section 12.02. Property Taxes with respect to the
Assets levied with respect to any period which begins after the Effective
Time, including such Taxes levied for the 2016 Tax year, shall be a liability
allocated to Buyer. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Property Taxes
levied with respect to the 2015 Tax year and shall file all statements,
returns, and documents incident thereto, If any Property Taxes allocated to
Buyer pursuant to this Section 11.03(b) are actually paid by Seller, then,
after Closing, and to the extent such Property Taxes are not taken into
account in Section 12.02, and upon written request by Seller, Buyer shall,
within fifteen (15) Business Days of such request, make a payment to Seller of
the amount of any Property Taxes paid by Seller but allocated to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 11.03(b). If any Property Taxes allocated to Seller
pursuant to this Section 11.03(b) are actually paid by Buyer, then, after
Closing, and to the extent such Property Taxes are not taken into account in
Section 12.02, and upon written request by Buyer, Seller shall, within fifteen
(15) Business Days of such request, make a payment to Buyer of the amount of
any Property Taxes paid by Buyer but allocated to Seller pursuant to this
Section 11.03(b). For the avoidance of doubt, "such Taxes levied for the 2015
tax year" means the Taxes levied in 2015 that are computed by reference to the
assessed valuation that is determined based on the price data related to
production in 2014, and "such Taxes levied for the 2016 calendar year" means
the Taxes levied in 2016 that are computed by reference to the assessed
valuation that is determined based on the price data related to production in
2015.

 

Section 11.04Post-Closing Tax Matters.

 

(a)After Closing, each of Buyer and Seller shall:

 

(i)reasonably cooperate and assist the other (A) in preparing any Tax Return

correspondence with respect to any Tax Controversy; and allow the other to
participate, at its own expense, in

   

any Tax Controversy, and not settle any Tax Controversy without the prior
written consent of the other, which may not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

 

(b)Any payments made to any party pursuant to Section 4.05(b), Section
5.04(a), Section 8.04, this Article XI or Article XVI shall constitute an
adjustment of the Purchase Price for Tax purposes and shall be treated as such
by Buyer and Seller on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by Law.

Affiliates and their agents and representatives in order to prepare, if
required, in connection with the Filings and corresponding financial
statements, along with any documentation attributable to the Assets required
to complete any audit associated with such financial statements. During the
Records Period, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide

Auditor") in connection with any audit by Buyer's Auditor of any financial
statements of Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the Assets that Buyer
or any of its Affiliates requires to comply with the requirements of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act with respect to any Filings. During the

Agreement). Each of Seller's and Buyer's (and their respective Affiliates')
obligations pursuant to this Section 14.06 shall survive the Closing

interests in a manner that complies with the provisions of this Article XV,
the acts or omissions of the other working interest owners shall not
constitute a violation of the provisions of this Article XV, nor shall any
action required by a vote of working interest owners constitute such a
violation. To the extent that Seller or an Affiliate of Seller is not the

causing the operation of) all such Assets following the Closing. Seller does
not warrant or guarantee that Buyer will become the operator of the operated
Assets or any portion of the Assets, as such matter will be controlled by the
applicable joint operating agreement(s). Notwithstanding the preceding,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, to the extent it has the
ability to do so, but without any obligation to incur any material, out-of-
pocket additional cost or expense, to have Buyer elected as "Operator" under
any applicable joint operating agreement(s) with respect to any of the Assets
which Seller served as "Operator" under such applicable joint operating
agreement as of the Closing.

the collapse of casing, sand infiltration of wells and damage to and
depreciation of property, including through normal wear and tear.

 

(b)If after the Execution Date and prior to the Closing any part of the Assets
shall be damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty or if any part of the
Assets shall be taken in condemnation or under the right of eminent domain or
if proceedings for such purposes shall be pending or threatened, this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any such
destruction, taking or proceeding, or the threat thereof and the Parties shall
proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such destruction or taking without reduction of the Purchase Price, but
subject to Section 15.04(c).

 

(c)In the event of any loss described in Section 15.04(b) (each, a "Casualty
Loss") at the Closing, Buyer shall have the option to have Seller: (i) retain
the affected Asset and reduce the Purchase Price by the Allocated Value of
such affected Asset as set forth on Exhibit B, (ii) repair or restore the
affected Assets to the same condition as existed prior to the Casualty Loss,
but in no event will Seller be required to expend more than the Allocated
Value for such Asset in order to make such repairs, or (iii) convey the
affected Asset as-is on account of such Casualty Loss, in which event on and
after the Closing, Seller, promptly upon receipt, shall pay to Buyer all sums
paid to Seller by third parties by reason of the destruction or taking of such
Assets (up to the Allocated Value thereof), including any sums paid pursuant
to any policy or agreement of insurance or indemnity (and Seller shall, on
Buyer's behalf, pursue any such sums to which it is or may be entitled), and
shall assign, transfer and set over unto Buyer all of the rights, title and
interest of Seller in and to any claims, causes of action, unpaid proceeds or
other payments from third parties, including any policy or agreement of
insurance or indemnity, arising out of such destruction or taking.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 15.04,
nothing in this Section 15.04 shall alter Buyer's termination rights set forth
in Section 13.01(d) with regard to any Casualty Losses or its rights to
indemnity as provided for in Section 16.04.

promptly after the Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of the Claim and
shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to the Claim;

to be a denial by the Indemnifying Party as to its liability or obligation to
defend the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party is authorized, prior to
and before the expiration of this 30-day period, to file any motion, answer or
other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate to

   

protect its interests or those of the Indemnifying Party and that is not

any Claim which does not include an unconditional written release of the
Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim or (ii) settle
any Claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect any Claim in
any manner that may materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party
(other than as a result of money damages covered by the indemnity).

 

(e)If the Indemnifying Party does not admit its liability to defend the
Indemnified Party or admits its liability to defend the Indemnified Party but
fails diligently to prosecute or settle the Claim, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to defend against the Claim at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnifying Party, with counsel of the Indemnified Party's choosing,
subject to the right of the Indemnifying Party to admit its liability to
defend the Indemnified Party and assume the defense of the Claim at any time
prior to its settlement or final determination. If the Indemnifying Party has
not yet admitted its liability to defend the Indemnified Party for a Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party of any proposed
settlement and the Indemnifying Party shall have the option, on or before the
tenth (10th) day following receipt of that notice (i) to admit in writing its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party for the Claim, and (ii) if its
liability to defend the Indemnified Party is so admitted, to reject, in its
reasonable judgment, the proposed settlement. 

 

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim
Notice (i) to cure the Losses complained of, (ii) to admit its liability for
those Losses, or (iii) to dispute the claim for those Losses. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within this 30-day
period that it has cured the Losses, admits its liability for such Losses or
disputes the claim for those Losses, then the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to be disputing the claim for such Losses.

days after the delivery of such Election Notice in accordance with following:

 

(a)in the case of any Dispute regarding Title Defects, Title Defect Values or

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall

Section 19.15Survival.

 

(a)Seller's Representations and Warranties. As a condition precedent to any
Claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect to the alleged breach by
Seller of any of Seller's representations and warranties in this Agreement,
and subject to Section 19.15(e), Seller must have received a Claim Notice on
or before the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date,
except that (i) Buyer may make a Claim Notice indefinitely following the
Closing Date with respect to the alleged breach by Seller of any of Seller's
representations and warranties in Section 6.1 (Seller's Existence), Section
6.02 (Legal Power), Section 6.03 (Execution), and Section 6.04 (Brokers)
("Fundamental Representations") and (ii) Seller must have received a Claim
Notice on or before sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations under the Tax laws in question with respect to the
alleged breach by Seller of any of Seller's representations in Section 6.08
(Taxes). Seller's indemnification obligation under Section 16.04(b) will
terminate as of the time periods set forth in this Section 19.15, and after
such date Seller will have no liability whatsoever with respect to Seller's
representations or warranties in this Agreement that have expired on such
date.

 

(b)Seller's Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Covenants. As a condition precedent
to any Claim for indemnity under this Agreement with respect to each of the
covenants and performance obligations of Seller set forth in this Agreement
that are to be complied with or performed by Seller prior to Closing, and
subject to Section 19.15(e), Seller must have received a Claim Notice on or
before the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date.
Seller's indemnification obligation under Section 16.04(c) with respect to
each of the covenants and performance obligations of Seller set forth in this
Agreement that are to be complied with or performed by Seller prior to Closing
will terminate as of the time period set forth in this Section 19.15(b), and
after such date Seller will have no liability whatsoever with respect to any
of the covenants and performance obligations of Seller set forth in this
Agreement that are to be complied with or performed by Seller prior to
Closing. Buyer may make a Claim Notice indefinitely following the Closing
Date with respect to the alleged breach by Seller of any of

   

Seller's covenants and performance obligations set forth in this Agreement
that are to be complied with or performed by Seller after the Closing.

 

(c)Seller's Other Indemnification Obligations. As a condition precedent to
any Claim for indemnity under Section 16.04(a) for a claim arising under
Section 16.01(a), (c) or (e), Section 16.04(e) or Section 16.04(f) Seller must
have received a Claim Notice on or before the date that is three (3) years
following the Closing Date, after which time, Seller's indemnity obligations
shall terminate and Seller shall have no liability with respect to such
indemnification obligations. As a condition precedent to any Claim for
indemnity under Section 16.04(g), Seller must have received a Claim Notice on
or before the date that is five (5) years following the Closing Date, after
which time, Seller's indemnity obligations shall terminate and Seller shall
have no liability with respect to such indemnification obligations. Buyer
may submit a Claim Notice with respect to a Claim for indemnity under Section
16.04(a) (other than the sections identified in the preceding sentence) or
Section 16.04(d) indefinitely.

 

(d)Buyer's Indemnification. The representations, warranties, covenants and
performance obligations of Buyer in this Agreement and the other documents
executed at Closing, and all covenants, assumptions, and indemnities set forth
in Section 16.03 shall survive the Closing indefinitely. 

 

(e)Survival after Claim. Notwithstanding Sections 19.15(a) through 19.15(d),
if a Claim Notice has been properly delivered under Section 16.05 before the
date any representation, warranty, covenant, or performance obligation would
otherwise expire under such Sections alleging a right to indemnification or
defense for Losses arising out, relating to, or attributable to the breach of
such representation, warranty, covenant, or performance obligation, such
representation, warranty, covenant, or performance obligation shall continue
to survive as to the matters asserted in the Claim Notice until the claims
asserted in such Claim Notice that are based on the breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant, or performance obligation have been fully
and finally resolved.

 

(f)Reasonableness. The Parties acknowledge that the time limitations set forth
in this Section 19.15 are reasonable. 

 

Section 19.16Time of the Essence. Time shall be of the essence with respect to
all time periods and notice periods set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 19.17Counterpart Execution. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts (including by facsimile or email transmission), and
each such counterpart shall be effective as to each Party that executes the
same whether or not all of Parties execute the same counterpart. If
counterparts of this Agreement are executed, the signature pages from various
counterparts may be combined into one composite instrument for all purposes.
All counterparts together shall constitute only one Agreement, but each
counterpart shall be considered an original.

 

Section 19.18Knowledge. Whenever a statement in this Agreement is qualified by
a phrase such as to Seller's "Knowledge," (or similar use of "Knowledge"
attributable to Seller), the Parties intend that the only information to be
attributed to Seller is information actually

   

known (after reasonable inquiry) by Bill Alleman, Doug Dietrich, Patrick
Flynn, Michael Stefanoudakis, Rick Betz, Jim Piccone and Ted Gazulis. 

 

Section 19.19Relationship of the Parties. This Agreement shall not create and
it is not the purpose or intention of the Parties to create any partnership,
mining partnership, joint venture, general partnership, or other partnership
relationship and none shall be inferred, and nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to establish a fiduciary relationship between the Parties for any
purpose.
