iii  AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER ("Agreement") is made and entered into as of
April 4, 2012, by and among SPECTRUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"); SAPPHIRE ACQUISITION SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and
ALLOS THERAPEUTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_.

 

RECITALS

 

A. Parent intends to acquire the Company in accordance with this Agreement and
the DGCL.

 

B. Pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a tender
offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (the "Offer") to
purchase all of the outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of
the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), in exchange for, with respect to
each share of Common Stock, (i) an amount in cash equal to $1.82 (the "Cash
Portion"), and (ii) one contingent value right (a "CVR" and, together with the
Cash Portion, the "Merger Consideration"), which shall represent the right
to receive the Milestone Payment (as such term is used in the CVR Agreement)
in cash in connection with the achievement of certain milestones as set forth
in the CVR Agreement, and in accordance therewith.

 

C. Following the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company in
accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL (the "Merger"), and each share of
Company Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer
will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration. Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to
exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

D. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have approved this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger.

E. The Company Board has (i) authorized the execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and approved the Offer and the
Merger, and (ii) recommended that the holders of Company Common Stock accept
the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub pursuant
to the Offer and, if required by the DGCL, adopt this Agreement.

F. Immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement, certain Company
stockholders have delivered to Parent tender and voting agreements (the
"Company Stockholder Support Agreements") providing that such Company
stockholders have agreed to (i) tender the shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by them in the Offer, and (ii) if required by the DGCL,
vote the shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement.  AGREEMENT

The parties to this Agreement, intending to be legally bound, agree as
follows:

 

Section 1\. THE OFFER



     | 1.1 | The Offer. 
---|---|--- 

(a)  _Commencement of the Offer_. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange
Act), the Offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock at a price per share equal to the Merger Consideration (as adjusted as
provided in Section 1.3, if applicable) as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof (and in any event within twelve (12) days of the date
hereof) and in compliance with Section 14(d) and Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Legal Requirements.

(b)  _Payment_. Subject solely to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by Section 1.1(c)) of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, consummate the Offer in accordance with its
terms and accept for payment and pay for all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as
practicable after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as it may be
extended in accordance with Section 1.1(d)) and in any event in compliance
with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Cash Portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or any subsequent offering
period contemplated by Section 1.1(e) hereof shall be paid to the holder
thereof in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable federal back-up
withholding or other Taxes required by Legal Requirement to be withheld or
deducted. In accordance with Sections 2.1 and 2.3 of the CVR Agreement, and
subject to the terms of the CVR Agreement, Parent shall cause to be registered
in the name of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock one CVR for
each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer or any subsequent offering period contemplated by
Section 1.1(e) hereof. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger
Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase all shares of Company
Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

(c) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Merger Sub to
accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject solely to the
satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by this Section 1(c)) of the conditions set forth in clauses
(b)(i) through (b)(vii) set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (collectively with the
Minimum Condition, the "Offer Conditions"). Merger Sub may waive any Offer
Condition set forth in clauses (b)(i) through (b)(vii) of _Annex A_ hereto,
increase the Merger Consideration payable in the Offer and make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not,
and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i) subject to Section 1.3,
decrease the Merger Consideration or change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (ii) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend, change or impose conditions to the
Offer other than the Offer Conditions, (iv) amend, or waive satisfaction of,
the Minimum Conditions, (v) extend or terminate the Offer in any manner other
than in accordance with Section 1.1(d) or (vi) amend or change any term or
condition of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the shares of
Company Common Stock.

 



2 (d) _Expiration of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cause the
Offer to remain open, unless extended as provided below, until midnight, New
York time, at the end of the day on the date that is twenty (20) business days
(for this purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) after the date the Offer is commenced (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such time and date,
the "Initial Expiration Date") or if the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, on the date to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to
which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the "Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, extend or re-extend the Offer for successive
extension periods of ten (10) business days (for this purpose calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) in the
event that any of the Minimum Condition or the other Offer Conditions are not
satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by Section 1.1(c)) as of any then
scheduled Expiration Date until such time as the Minimum Condition and the
other Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted by
Section 1.1(c)), and (ii) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, extend or re-extend the Offer for any period required by any Governmental
Body or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the
staff thereof or the NASDAQ Global Market applicable to the Offer; _provided_
, _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) of this
Section 1.1(d), in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer
beyond the End Date and (iii) Merger Sub shall provide for a subsequent
offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in accordance with
Section 1.1(e) hereof. If this Agreement has been terminated pursuant
to Section 8 before the acceptance by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common
Stock for payment, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
promptly terminate the Offer without accepting any shares of Company Common
Stock for payment and return all shares of Company Common Stock deposited by
or on behalf of the holders of the Company Common Stock in compliance with
Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act; otherwise Merger Sub shall
not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration Date without the
prior written consent of the Company.

(e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If on the date the Offer expires, the
Minimum Condition has been satisfied, or with the consent of the Company,
waived, and all other Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived (to the
extent permitted by Section 1.1(c)), and, upon the acceptance of shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer,
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates would not own at least
ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of each class of capital stock
of the Company entitled to vote on the adoption of this Agreement under
applicable Legal Requirement (the "Short Form Threshold"), Merger Sub may, and
if requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, provide for a subsequent
offering period within the meaning of, and in compliance with, Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act and all other provisions of applicable
securities laws (the "Subsequent Offering Period") of successive periods of up
to five (5) business days each (for this purpose calculated in accordance
with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) immediately
following the expiration of the Offer (or such longer period of up to twenty
(20) business days immediately following expiration of the Offer, and
calculated in the same manner, if the Company consents in writing prior to
such extension). Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to
reserve the right of Merger Sub to provide for the Subsequent Offering
Period. During the Subsequent Offering Period, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, immediately accept for payment and promptly pay for
all shares of Company Common Stock as they are tendered pursuant to the Offer
during the Subsequent Offering Period in accordance with Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act and in any event in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



3 (f) _Schedule TO; Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer,
Merger Sub and Parent shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on
Schedule TO (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto,
the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or
shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase relating to the Offer
(the "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the related letter of transmittal, a
related summary advertisement in respect of the Offer, and such other
ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
or which are required to be filed in connection with the filing of the
Schedule TO (the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents,
together with all exhibits, supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents") and (ii) cause the
Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (collectively, the "Company Stockholders") as and to the extent
required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall cause the Schedule
TO and the other Offer Documents to comply in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and all other applicable Legal Requirements. Parent and Merger Sub
hereby further agree that the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed
with the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto, on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders and at the time of
consummation of the Offer, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no representation or warranty is made or covenant is agreed
to by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to information supplied by the
Company in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Except to the extent subsequently
amended, modified or supplemented in a subsequently filed Schedule TO or
Offer Document, the Company hereby agrees that the information provided by the
Company in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents, when filed with the SEC, at the time
of any amendment or supplement thereto, on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company Stockholders and at the time of consummation of the
Offer, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent
and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company that may be
required by applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by Parent or
Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Offer Documents prior to such documents being filed with the
SEC or disseminated to the Company Stockholders. In addition, Parent and
Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel promptly with copies of
any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent,
Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
proposed written or oral responses and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel and to participate in any substantive
telephonic communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto.

 



4 (g) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all
reasonable actions to cause the Offer to be conducted in accordance with all
applicable Legal Requirements.



     | 1.2 | Company Action.

within ten (10) days thereafter, the Company shall (i) file with the SEC
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") and (ii) cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company Stockholders as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the extent reasonably
practicable, the Schedule 14D-9 shall be filed with the SEC on the same day as
the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule TO and the parties shall
cooperate to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the Company
Stockholders with the Offer Documents (and if so, the expense thereof shall be
borne by Parent in connection with its dissemination of the Offer Documents).
The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (i) comply in all material
respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and all other applicable Legal Requirements, and (ii)

further agrees that the Schedule 14D-9, when filed with the SEC, at the time
of any amendment or supplement thereto, on the date first published, sent or
given to the Company Stockholders, and at the time of the consummation of the
Offer, shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
representation or warranty is made or covenant is agreed to by the Company
with respect to information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub in writing
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule
14D-9. Except to the extent subsequently amended, modified or supplemented in
a subsequently filed Schedule 14D-9, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree that
the information provided by Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Schedule 14D-9, when filed with
the SEC, at the time of any amendment or supplement thereto, on the date
first published, sent or given to the Company Stockholders, and at the time of
consummation of the Offer, shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing all information
concerning Parent or Merger Sub that may be required by applicable securities
laws or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule
14D-9. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to correct promptly
any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 that shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC and, as so corrected, to be disseminated
to the Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. In addition, the Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel promptly with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto. The Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review any proposed written or oral
responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub
and their counsel and to participate in any substantive telephonic
communications with the staff of the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal by the
Company or any action by the Company or the Company Board permitted by the
proviso contained in Section 5.4(a) or by Section 5.4(f), the Company shall
not be required to provide Parent or Merger Sub the opportunity to review or
comment on (or include comments proposed by Parent or Merger Sub in), or
permit Parent or Merger Sub to participate in any discussions regarding, such
Schedule 14D-9, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any comments
thereon, to the extent such Schedule 14d-9 or any such discussions relate to
such Acquisition Proposal, the reasons for such Acquisition Proposal or any
actions taken with respect thereto, or any additional information reasonably
related to such Acquisition Proposal.

 



5 (b) _Mailing Information_. In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the
Company shall, or shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly furnish Parent
and Merger Sub (at Parents and Merger Subs sole cost and expense) with
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and with security position listings of shares
of Company Common Stock held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date
(and, to the extent available, such information with respect to persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date), together with all other
reasonably available listings and computer files containing names, addresses
and security position listings of record holders and beneficial owners of
shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish Parent and
Merger Sub (at Parents and Merger Subs sole cost and expense) with such
additional information, including updated listings and computer files of
stockholders, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other
assistance in disseminating the Offer Documents to holders of shares of
Company Common Stock as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request. Subject
to the requirements of applicable Legal Requirement, and except for such steps
as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent and Merger Sub shall
(and shall cause each of their respective affiliates, associates, partners,
directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors to): (i) hold in
confidence the information contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) and all
extracts and summaries thereof on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and use such information only for
purposes of consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) if
this Agreement shall be terminated and/or the Offer shall terminate without
any shares of Company Common Stock having been accepted, deliver to the
Company or destroy, and, upon the Companys request, provide the Company with
a certificate of such destruction signed by an officer of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, all copies of such information then in their or
their Representatives possession or control.

 



6 1.3 Adjustment to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration (and any
payment to holders of Company Options or Company RSUs pursuant to Section
6.3) shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to Merger Subs acceptance for payment of and payment
for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and such adjustment
to the Merger Consideration shall provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock (and such holders of Company Options or Company RSUs) the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action.

1.4 Top-Up.

 

(a) Subject to Section 1.4(b), Section 1.4(c), Section 1.4(d) and Section
1.4(e) hereof, the Company grants to Merger Sub a non-assignable right and
Merger Sub accepts a non-assignable obligation (the "Top-Up"), exercisable
only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, to
purchase from the Company that number of newly issued shares of Company
Common Stock equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock
that, when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up, constitutes one share more
than ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up, at a price
per share of Company Common Stock equal to the greater of (i) the last
reported sale price of a share of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global
Market on the last trading day prior to the date on which the Top-Up is
exercised or (ii) the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration.

(b) Merger Sub shall (unless the Short Form Threshold has already been
exceeded) exercise the Top-Up once, in whole and not in part, promptly
following the later of the Acceptance Time or the expiration of the Subsequent
Offering Period, and in any event within one (1) Business Day after the date
on which the Merger Sub accepts for payment shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer or such later expiration of the Subsequent Offering
Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up shall not be exercisable and the
Company shall not be required to issue any shares pursuant to the Top-Up if
(i) immediately after the issuance of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Top-Up, the Short Form Threshold would not be reached (assuming
the issuance of such shares pursuant to such exercise), (ii) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock otherwise to be issued thereunder exceeds the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is
authorized to issue under its Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, but
that are not issued and outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise
committed to be issued or reserved for issuance) at the time of the closing of
the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up, or
(iii) a provision of any applicable Legal Requirement, excluding the rules and
regulations of the NASDAQ Global Market, shall prohibit the exercise of the
Top-Up or the delivery of the shares to be purchased thereunder in respect of
such exercise.

 



7 (c) The aggregate purchase price payable for the shares of Company Common
Stock being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the greater of (i) the
last reported sale price of a share of Company Common Stock on the NASDAQ
Global Market on the last trading day prior to the date on which the Top-Up
is exercised or (ii) the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration. Such
purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub, at its election, either entirely in
cash or by paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par
value of such shares and by executing and delivering to the Company one or
more unsecured, non-negotiable and non-transferrable promissory notes having a
principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price,
which promissory note shall be guaranteed by Parent. Any such promissory note
shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, compounded monthly, and shall
mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty, and shall
become immediately due and payable in the event that Parent or Merger Sub
files or has filed against it any petition under any bankruptcy or insolvency
law or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors.

(d) In the event Merger Sub shall be obligated to exercise the Top-Up pursuant
to Section 1.4(b), Merger Sub shall deliver to the Company a written notice
setting forth (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are or
will be owned by Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the shares
pursuant to the Top-Up, (ii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay
the applicable exercise price, and (iii) the date of the closing of the
purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up in
accordance with Section 1.4(c). The Company shall, promptly following receipt
of such notice, deliver written notice to Merger Sub specifying the number of
shares of Company Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Top-Up and the
consideration due in exchange therefor, calculated in accordance with this
Section 1.4 (or stating that the Top-Up is not then exercisable pursuant to
Section 1.4(b)). At the closing of the purchase of such shares of Company
Common Stock, Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such shares in
accordance with this Section 1.4, and the Company shall cause to be issued to
Merger Sub a certificate representing such shares (or the applicable number
of shares of Company Common Stock in noncertificated book-entry form). The
Company Board has taken all steps necessary such that upon issuance and
delivery in accordance with this Section 1.4(d), such shares shall be
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the shares of Company Common Stock
issuable to Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up will not be registered under
the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an applicable exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is and will be,
upon the purchase of such shares, an "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule
501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act).

 



8 (f) The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the failure to obtain approval of the Companys
stockholders of the issuance of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Top-Up as
a result of the NASDAQ Global Market or any other applicable stock exchange
listing requirements shall not cause any condition to the Offer not to be
met.

1.5 Company Board Representation; Section 14(f).

 

(a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Upon the initial
acceptance for purchase by Merger Sub of shares of Company Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance Time," the use of which term
herein shall not, unless the context otherwise requires, depend upon whether
Parent shall exercise its rights under this Section 1.5(a)) and from time to
time thereafter, subject to payment for such shares of Company Common Stock,
Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate up to such number of directors
(rounded up to the next whole number) on the Company Board as shall give
Merger Sub representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors
elected or appointed pursuant to this Section 1.5(a)) multiplied by the
percentage that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
beneficially owned by Merger Sub following such purchase bears to the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding, and the Company
shall promptly thereafter take such actions as are reasonably requested by
Merger Sub to cause Merger Subs designees to be elected or appointed as
directors of the Company, including by increasing the size of the Company
Board or securing the resignations of incumbent directors, or both
as necessary. From time to time after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall
take all action necessary to cause the individuals so designated by Merger Sub
to constitute substantially the same percentage (rounding up where
appropriate) as is on the Company Board of each committee of the Company
Board (except for any committee established to take action with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement) to the fullest extent permitted by all
applicable Legal Requirement and the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the purchase by Merger Sub of shares
of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and before the Effective Time,
in the event that Merger Subs designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.5(a), the Company Board shall
maintain at least three (3) directors who are members of the Company Board on
the date hereof, each of whom shall be an "independent director" as defined
by the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market Global Market or the federal
securities Legal Requirements who are considered independent directors within
the meaning of such rules and Legal Requirements ("Independent
Directors") eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the
Exchange Act and the NASDAQ Global Market rules and, at least one of whom
shall be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the "Continuing Directors");
_provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve
due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary
action (including creating a committee of the Company Board) so that the
remaining Continuing Directors shall be entitled to elect or designate another
person that satisfies the foregoing independence requirements to fill such
vacancy, and such person shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of
Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of directors as may be
required by such rules and regulations for any reason whatsoever (including,
with respect to the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market, such rules governing
the requirements for the continued listing of the shares of Company Common
Stock), the remaining Independent Director(s) shall designate persons to fill
such vacancies and such designees shall be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then
remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may
be required by the rules of the NASDAQ Global Market and the federal
securities laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be employees, directors,
stockholders or other affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub, and such designees
shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.
From and after the Acceptance Time and for so long as any members of the
Company Board are Continuing Directors, Parent shall ensure that each
Continuing Director who is not then covered by the Companys directors and
officers liability insurance policies is covered by, and a beneficiary of,
Parents directors and officers liability insurance policies (or equivalent
insurance policies).

 



9 (b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Merger Subs designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section
1.5(a) hereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.5 prior to the
Acceptance Time and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with
respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill such obligations. Parent or Merger Sub
shall, promptly after the date hereof and at least five (5) days prior to the
commencement of the Offer, supply to the Company on a timely basis, and be
solely responsible for, any information with respect to either of them and
their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f)
of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

(c) _Required Approvals of Continuing Directors_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, following the appointment or
election of designees of Merger Sub pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and prior to
the Effective Time, any (i) amendment or modification of this Agreement or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii)
termination of this Agreement by the Company, (iii) extension by the Company
of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, (iv) recommendation to the Company
Stockholders or any modification or withdrawal of any such recommendation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (v)
exercise or waiver of any of the Companys conditions, rights or remedies
hereunder, (vi) amendment, rescission, repeal or waiver of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws of the Company, (vii) authorization or execution of
any agreement, or of any amendment of modification of any agreement, between
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their affiliates, on the other hand, or (vii) other action of
the Company or the Company Board under or in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
in each case, may be effected only if there are in office one or more
Continuing Directors and such action is approved by a majority of the
Continuing Directors. Following the appointment or election of designees of
Merger Sub pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and prior to the Effective Time, any
actions with respect to the enforcement of this Agreement by the Company shall
be effected only by and at the direction of a majority of the Continuing
Directors (or the action of the sole Continuing Director, if there shall only
be one Continuing Director then in office), and any such authorization or
direction shall constitute the authorization and direction of the full
Company Board with respect thereto, and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize, or for the Company to take, any such action. 

 



10 1.6 Merger Without Meeting of the Stockholders. Notwithstanding the terms of
Sections 6.1 and 6.2, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by Merger Sub in
accordance with this Agreement and, if applicable, the exercise of the Top-Up,
Parent and Merger Sub shall then own shares of capital stock of the Company
that meet the Short Form Threshold, the parties hereto agree to take all
necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within one (1) Business Day,
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section
253 of the DGCL.

Section 2\. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION

nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of each of such conditions). The date on which the Closing actually
takes place is referred to as the "Closing Date." Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable requirements
of the DGCL shall be duly executed by the Company and concurrently with or as
soon as practicable following the Closing shall be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at the time
of the filing of such certificate of merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be designated jointly by
Parent and the Company and specified in such certificate of merger (the time
as of which the Merger becomes effective being referred to as the

11 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; Directors and Officers.

 

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated immediately after the Effective Time to read as set
forth on _Exhibit B_;

(b) The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and
restated immediately after the Effective Time to conform to read as set forth
on _Exhibit C_; and

(c) The directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers of Merger Sub prior to
the Effective Time.

2.5 Cancellation, Payment and Conversion of Shares.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any stockholder of the Company:

 

(i) any shares of Company Common Stock owned by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (or held in the Companys
treasury) shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

 

(ii) any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;

(iii) except as provided in clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" above and subject to
Section 2.6, each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration; and

(iv) each share of the Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) If, during the period from the Acceptance Time through the Effective Time,
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock are changed into a different
number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, combination of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, or if
a stock dividend is declared by the Company during such period, then the
Merger Consideration, and any payment to holders of Company Options or Company
RSUs pursuant to Section 6.3, shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate to
provide the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such action.

 



12 2.6 Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders who have properly exercised appraisal rights with respect thereto in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") will not be
converted as described in Section 2.5(a)(iii), and holders of such shares will
be entitled only to such rights and consideration as are granted pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (without regard to the Top-Up, any shares of Common
Stock issued upon the exercise of the Top-Up or any promissory notes issued in
consideration for the purchase price of shares of Common Stock purchased
pursuant to the Top-Up). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses its right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, the shares of Company
Common Stock held by such holder that were Dissenting Shares will thereupon
be treated as if they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Upon
the Companys receipt of any notice of intent to demand payment in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL, or any withdrawal of such notice,
and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and
received by the Company, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable provide Parent with a copy of such notice or instrument. The
Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent, prior to
the Closing, on the other hand, shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the other party hereto or pursuant to an Order, make any payment
with respect to any such election to dissent or offer to settle or settle any
such election to dissent.

2.7 Closing of the Companys Transfer Books. At the Effective Time: (a) all
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and all holders of Book Entry Shares or
of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.8(c); and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any
shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "Company Stock Certificate") or a Book Entry Share is presented to the
Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 2.8.

2.8 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and the Company shall, and Parent
shall cause the CVR Rights Agent to, authorize, execute and deliver the CVR
Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank
or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as exchange
agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall issue and cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent cash in
an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Portion of the Merger
Consideration payable in connection with the Merger (it being understood and
agreed, for the avoidance of doubt, that Parent shall not be required to
deposit any of the funds related to any CVR with the CVR Rights Agent unless
and until such deposit is required pursuant to the terms of the CVR
Agreement). The cash amount deposited pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence with the Exchange Agent is referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

 



13 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent will mail to the
Persons who were record holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify
and the Company shall reasonably approve prior to the Effective Time
(including a provision confirming that delivery of Company Stock Certificates
or Book Entry Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company
Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of
such Company Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent);
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive, and the Exchange Agent shall
(and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to) in exchange therefor transfer
from the Exchange Fund to such holder the Cash Portion of the Merger
Consideration such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions
of Section 2.5(a)(iii); (B) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Shares shall be identified in the register maintained by the CVR
Rights Agent for the purpose of identifying the holders of the CVRs pursuant
to the terms of the CVR Agreement as the holder of that number of CVRs such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.5(a)(iii), in accordance with the terms of the CVR Agreement, and (C) the
Company Stock Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall be
canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.8(b),
each Company Stock Certificate and Book Entry Share (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.5
and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.8(c). If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition to the payment of any Merger
Consideration in respect of the shares represented thereby, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to post a bond, in
such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate.

(c) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Company Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares as of the date that is one
year after the date on which the Merger becomes effective shall be delivered
to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares who have not theretofore surrendered their Company Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with this Section 2.8 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for
the Merger Consideration.

(d) Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To
the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Body, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



14 (e) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder
or former holder of Company Common Stock or to any other Person for any cash
amounts required to be delivered to any public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or other Legal Requirement.

 

2.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary
or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name
of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

Section 3\. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows (it
being understood that each representation and warranty contained in this
Section 3 is subject to: (a) the exceptions and disclosures set forth in the

particular Section or subsection in this Section 3 in which such

January 1, 2012 and publicly available thereon prior to the date of this

bound by any Contract under which it may become obligated to make, any future
investment in or capital contribution to any other Entity.

15 (c) Each of the Alaska Corporations is qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation, and is in good standing, under the laws of all jurisdictions
where the nature of its business requires such qualification, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or in good standing,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

3.2 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has delivered or
Made Available to Parent accurate and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws, memorandum of association and articles of association

SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board thereunder. All non-

that were required to be approved in accordance with Section 202 of the

(e) The Company maintains a system of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange

reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Alaska Corporations; (ii) provide reasonable

the effectiveness of the Companys system of internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-

any fiduciary thereof.

 



34 (e) Each of the Alaska Corporations and Company Affiliates has performed in
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
each Company Employee Plan and Company Employee Agreement, and each Company
Employee Plan and Company Employee Agreement has been established and
maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
applicable Legal Requirements. Any Company Employee Plan intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has obtained a favorable
determination letter (or opinion letter, if applicable) as to its qualified
status under the Code. All Company Pension Plans required to have been
approved by any foreign Governmental Body have been so approved, no such
approval has been revoked (or, to the knowledge of the Company, has revocation
been threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most recent
approval or application therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan
that would reasonably be expected to materially affect any such approval
relating thereto or materially increase the costs relating thereto. Each
Company Employee Plan intended to be tax qualified under applicable Legal
Requirements is so tax qualified, and no event has occurred and no
circumstance or condition exists that would reasonably be expected to result
in the disqualification of any such Company Employee Plan. No "prohibited
transaction," within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code or Sections 406
and 407 of ERISA, and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Each Company Employee Plan
(other than any Company Employee Plan to be terminated prior to the Effective
Time in accordance with this Agreement) can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued after the Closing in accordance with its terms,
without liability to Parent, any of the Alaska Corporations or any Company
Affiliate (other than any liability for ordinary administration expenses).
There are no audits or inquiries pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by the IRS, the DOL or any other Governmental Body with respect to
any Company Employee Plan or any fiduciary thereof. None of the Alaska
Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever incurred: (i) any material
penalty or tax with respect to any Company Employee Plan under Section 502(i)
of ERISA or Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code; or (ii) any material
penalty or Tax under applicable Legal Requirements. Each of the Alaska
Corporations and Company Affiliates has made all contributions and other
payments required by and due under the terms of each Company Employee Plan and
each Company Employee Agreement. Neither the terms nor the performance of
any Company Employee Agreement or Company Employee Plan would reasonably be
expected to result in gross income inclusion after the Effective Time pursuant
to Section 409A(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

 

(f) None of the Alaska Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any:

in Section 413 of the Code. No Company Employee Plan is or has been funded
by, associated with or related to a "voluntary employees beneficiary
association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. None of the
Alaska Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, has ever maintained,
established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any Company Pension
Plan in which stock of any of the Alaska Corporations or any Company Affiliate
is or was held as a plan asset. The fair market value of the assets of each
funded Foreign Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded
through insurance, or the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
in full for the accrued benefit obligations, with respect to all current and
former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan, and no Contemplated
Transaction will cause any such assets or insurance obligations to be less
than such benefit obligations. There are no material liabilities of the Alaska
Corporations with respect to any Company Employee Plan that are not properly
accrued and reflected in the financial statements of the Company in accordance
with GAAP.

 



35 (g) None of the Alaska Corporations, and no Company Affiliate, maintains,
sponsors or contributes to any Company Employee Plan that is an employee
welfare benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and
that is, in whole or in part, self-funded or self-insured. No Company Employee
Plan provides (except at no cost to the Alaska Corporations or any Company
Affiliate), or reflects or represents any liability of any of the Alaska
Corporations or any Company Affiliate to provide, post-termination or retiree
life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefits or other post-
termination or retiree employee welfare benefits to any Person for any reason,
except as may be required by COBRA or other applicable Legal Requirements.
Other than commitments made that involve no future costs to any of the Alaska
Corporations or any Company Affiliate, none of the Alaska Corporations nor any
Company Affiliate has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in
oral or written form) to any Company Associate (either individually or to
Company Associates as a group) or any other Person that such Company
Associate(s) or other Person would be provided with post-termination or
retiree life insurance, post-termination or retiree health benefit or other
post-termination or retiree employee welfare benefits, except to the extent
required by applicable Legal Requirements.

and except as expressly required or provided by this Agreement, neither the

writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), Parent
and Merger Sub: 

(i) shall take all action necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; 

(ii) shall not terminate the Commitment Letter or amend or modify the

any line of business of the Company and the entering into of a definitive

consent, order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Body necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the expiration
or termination of any applicable waiting period, (x) increase the risk of any

funds sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs
obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Cash
Portion of the Merger Consideration and the payment of all associated costs

either Parent or Merger Sub, including (whether or not deemed material) to the
extent related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
notification given to the Company pursuant to this Section 5.3(c) shall
limit or otherwise affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants
or obligations of Parent contained in this Agreement.

 

5.4 No Solicitation.

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms or the Acceptance Time, the Company shall not,
directly or indirectly, and the Company shall not permit its Subsidiaries and
the respective Representatives of the Alaska Corporations to, directly or
indirectly:

 



52 (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate
the making, submission or announcement of any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to an Alaska Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an
Alaska Corporation;

 

(ii) furnish any information regarding any of the Alaska Corporations to any
Person in connection with or in response to an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to an Alaska Corporation or Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an
Alaska Corporation;

(iii) engage in discussions or negotiations with any Person relating to any

Corporation; or

(v) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction or
Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alaska Corporation;

_provided, however,_ that prior to the Acceptance Time, this Section 5.4(a)
shall not prohibit the Company from furnishing information regarding the
Alaska Corporations to, or entering into discussions and negotiations with,
any Person in response to an Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably expected
to result in a Company Superior Offer that is submitted to the Company by such
Person (and not withdrawn) if: (A) such Acquisition Proposal did not result
from any breach of, or any action inconsistent with, any of the provisions set
forth in this Section 5.4; (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith,
after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable law; (C) at
least two Business Days prior to furnishing any such information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, the Company gives
Parent written notice of the identity of such Person and of the Companys
intention to furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such
Person, and the Company receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement (which the Company may discuss with such Person during the two day
period) containing provisions (including nondisclosure provisions, use
restrictions and non-solicitation provisions) at least as favorable to the
Company as the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as in effect
immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement; and (D) at least two
Business Days prior to furnishing any such information to such Person, the
Company furnishes such information to Parent (to the extent such information
has not been previously furnished or Made Available by the Company to Parent).
Parent and the Company agree that any action inconsistent with
the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4 by any Alaska Corporation or
by any Representative of an Alaska Corporation will be deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.4 by the Company.

 



53 (b) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alaska Corporation or
Acquisition Inquiry with respect to an Alaska Corporation) advise Parent
orally and in writing of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry
(including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and the terms thereof, including a copy of any
written Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) that is made or submitted
by any Person prior to the Acceptance Time. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to: (i) the status of any such Acquisition
Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, including any negotiations with respect
thereto; and (ii) the status and terms of any material modification or
proposed material modification thereto.

(c) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions conducted on
or before the date of this Agreement with any Person that relate to any
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

 

(d) The Company agrees not to release or permit the release of any Person
from, or to waive or permit the waiver of any provision of,
any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar
Contract to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which it
or any of its Subsidiaries has any rights, and will use its reasonable efforts
to cause each such agreement to be enforced at the request of Parent, except
that the Company may waive any "standstill" or similar contract to which it or
any Subsidiary is a party if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
having consulted with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would reasonably constitute a breach of any fiduciary duties of the Company
Board.

(e) Subject to the following Section 5.4(f), from the date hereof to the
earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms and the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company Board Recommendation shall not
be directly or indirectly withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent
or Merger Sub; and (ii) neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof
shall: (A) fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, or
fail to publicly state that the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement are in
the best interest of the Companys stockholders, within five Business Days
after Parent requests in writing that such action be taken; (B) fail to
publicly announce, within ten Business Days after a tender offer or exchange
offer relating to the securities of the Company shall have been commenced, a
statement disclosing that the Company Board recommends rejection of
such tender or exchange offer; (C) fail to issue, within five Business Days
after an Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alaska Corporation is
publicly announced, a press release announcing its opposition to such
Acquisition Proposal; or (D) resolve to take any action described in clauses
"(i)" or "(ii)" of this sentence (each of the foregoing actions described in
clauses "(i)" and "(ii)" being referred to as a "Company Change
in Recommendation").

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(e) or
elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the
Company Board may effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may be,
a Company Change in Recommendation:

 



54 (i) if: (A) the Company has not otherwise breached its obligations under this
Section 5.4 in connection with the offer referred to in the following clause
"(B);" (B) after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, bona fide,
written offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (whether through a tender offer, merger or otherwise) is made to the
Company and is not withdrawn; (C) the Company Board determines in its good
faith judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, that such offer constitutes
a Company Superior Offer; (D) the Company Board does not effect, or cause the
Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation at any time within three
Business Days after Parent receives written notice from the Company
confirming that the Company Board has determined that such offer is a Company
Superior Offer; (E) during such three Business Day period, if requested by
Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the offer that was determined to
constitute a Company Superior Offer no longer constitutes a Company Superior
Offer; (F) at the end of such three Business Day period, such offer has not
been withdrawn and continues to constitute a Company Superior Offer (taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent as
a result of the negotiations required by clause "(E)" or otherwise); and (G)
the Company Board determines in good faith, after having consulted with its
outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Company Superior Offer, a
failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would reasonably constitute
a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys
stockholders under applicable law; or

(ii) if: (A) other than (1) the development or circumstances contemplated by
clause "(i)" of this Section 5.4(f) or (2) in connection with or as a result
of the making of, or any development or circumstance relating to, an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to an Alaska Corporation or an Acquisition
Inquiry with respect to an Alaska Corporation, a material development or
change in circumstances occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement
that was neither known to the Company Board nor reasonably foreseeable to the
Company Board as of the date of this Agreement (such material development or
change in circumstances being referred to as a "Company Intervening Event");
(B) at least three Business Days prior to any meeting of the Company Board at
which the Company Board will consider whether such Company Intervening Event
requires the Company Board to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a
Company Change in Recommendation, the Company provides Parent with a written
notice specifying the date and time of such meeting and the reasons for
holding such meeting; (C) during such three Business Day period, if requested
by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the Company Board
to effect, or cause the Company to effect, a Company Change in Recommendation
as a result of such Company Intervening Event; and (D) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal
counsel, that, in light of such Company Intervening Event, a failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation would reasonably constitute a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under
applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any development or change
involving the European Medicines Agencys re-examination of the negative
opinion issued with respect to the conditional approval of FOLOTYN® (the "EMA
Re-Examination") shall not be considered a Company Intervening Event.

 



55 (g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state law with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after having consulted with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to do so would reasonably constitute a breach of the fiduciary
duties of the Company Board to the Companys stockholders under applicable
law; _provided_ , in the case of each of clause (i) and (ii), that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Change in Recommendation unless the
Company Board publicly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within (A)
three (3) Business Days after Parent requests such reaffirmation in writing
(and, in any event, prior to any scheduled Expiration Date so long as Parent
has made such request at least two (2) Business Days prior to such scheduled
Expiration Date), or (B) two (2) Business Days after Parent requests such
reaffirmation in writing if the applicable disclosure by the Company or the
Company Board or any committee thereof relates to a positive opinion with
respect to the conditional approval of FOLOTYN® in the EMA Re-Examination and
such disclosure does not include such a reaffirmation, or (iii) making any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act.

5.5 No Control of the Companys Business. Nothing contained in this Agreement
is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries operations.

and the applicable SEC rules issued thereunder (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting"); and (B) submit such proposals to such holders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and shall not submit any other proposals to such
holders in connection with the Companys Stockholders Meeting without the
prior written consent of Parent.

(ii) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Acceptance Time, the
Company in consultation with Parent shall set a record date for persons
entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Companys Stockholders Meeting
and shall not change such record date without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(iii) Subject to the rights to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting as set forth below, the Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held
(on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent) as promptly as
practicable after the Acceptance Time.

(iv) The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited by the Alaska
Corporations and their Representatives in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company may after consultation with Parent adjourn or postpone the
Companys Stockholders Meeting, if any, only: (A) to the extent necessary to
ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is
required by applicable Legal Requirement (or in connection with the
settlement of any applicable litigation) is timely provided to the Companys
stockholders; (B) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting is originally scheduled there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business to be conducted at the Companys
Stockholders Meeting; or (C) if additional time is reasonably required to
solicit proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

 



57 (vi) The Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that
the Company Board has determined that this Agreement and the Merger are
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
stockholders, and recommends that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt
this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting.

6.3 Stock Options, RSUs and Company ESPP.

 

(a) As of the Acceptance Time, each Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall, if unvested, vest and become
exercisable in full by virtue of the Offer. Prior to and effective as of the
Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary to terminate the
Company Option Plans. Holders of all unexercised Company Options outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time with an exercise price per
share lower than the Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration will, in
consideration of the cancellation of their Company Options, be entitled to
receive (i) from the Company, and the Company shall cause to be delivered to
such holders, a cash payment upon the Acceptance Time (payable within 5
Business Days after the Acceptance Time), in an amount equal to the product of
(x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in such Company
Option and (y) the excess, if any, of (A) the Cash Portion of the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share provided for in such
Company Option, which cash payment shall be treated as compensation and shall
be net of any applicable withholding Tax, and (ii) from Parent, a CVR for each
share of Company Common Stock provided for in such Company Option. Each
Company Option with an exercise price per share equal to or in excess of the
Cash Portion of the Merger Consideration shall be canceled upon the Acceptance
Time without further consideration therefor.

(b) At the Acceptance Time, each holder of an award of Company RSUs
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company RSUs, be entitled to receive (i) from the
Company, and the Company shall cause to be delivered to such holder, a cash
payment upon the Acceptance Time (and payable within 5 Business Days after the
Acceptance Time), in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU and ( y) the Cash
Portion of the Merger Consideration, and (ii) from Parent a CVR for each share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU.

 

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take all action that may be necessary (under the
Company Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 6.3 and to ensure that, from and after the Acceptance Time, holders of
Company Equity Awards have no rights with respect thereto other than
those specifically provided in this Section 6.3.

 



58 (d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take all action that may be necessary to: (i) cause any outstanding
offering period (or similar period during which Company Common Stock may be
purchased) (the "Final Offering") under the Company ESPP to be terminated on
the earlier to occur of (A) June 30, 2012 and (B) the date immediately
following the Companys last payroll payment date prior to the Acceptance Time
(the date of such termination being referred to as the "Designated
Date"); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that may be necessary to reflect
the shortened Final Offering, but otherwise treat such shortened Final
Offering as a fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes
under the Company ESPP; and (iii) cause the exercise as of the Designated
Date of each outstanding purchase right under the Company ESPP. On the
Designated Date, the Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date
under the Company ESPP within each participants payroll withholding account
to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP. On the Designated Date and immediately following
the end of the Final Offering, the Company shall terminate the Company ESPP.
The Company has taken all action that may be necessary to ensure that (x)
there are no further contributions to the Company ESPP, (y) no participant in
the Company ESPP shall be permitted following the date of this Agreement to
(A) increase the amount of his or her rate of payroll contributions from the
rate in effect when the Final Offering commenced, or (B) make separate non-
payroll contributions to the Company ESPP, and (z) no individual who is not
participating in the Company ESPP as of the date of this Agreement may
hereafter commence participation in the Company ESPP (such that the funds
credited through the date hereof in respect of the Company ESPP shall not
change until the earlier of (i) the termination of this Agreement and (ii)
the date on which the Company applies such funds to the purchase of Company
Common Stock in accordance with this Section 6.3(d)).

 

6.4 Employee Benefits.

(a) Parent agrees that, subject to any necessary transition period and subject
to any applicable plan provisions, contractual requirements or Legal
Requirements all employees of the Alaska Corporations who continue employment
with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") shall be
eligible to participate in Parents health, vacation and 401(k) plans, to
substantially the same extent as similarly situated employees of Parent.

(b) Nothing in this Section 6.4 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be
construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Subsidiary of Parent. Except
for Company Indemnified Persons to the extent of their respective rights
pursuant to Section 6.5, no Company Associate, and no Continuing Employee,
shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

 

(c) If requested in writing by Parent at least five days prior to the Closing,
the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or
appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on
which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Employee Plan that contains a
cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"). If the Company is required to terminate any
Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the
Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board
of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the
form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review
of Parent). The Company also shall take, prior to the Effective Time, such
other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as
Parent may reasonably request in writing.

 



59 (d) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA and each vacation and severance plan (that is not an "employee
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "Parent Benefit Plans") in which any
Continuing Employee will participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service of the
Continuing Employees with the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and participation, in any such Parent
Benefit Plan to the extent such service was credited under the applicable
Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and subject to the concurrence of any
third-party insurers (which Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a welfare
benefit plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time, other than preexisting condition limitations,
exclusions or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such
Continuing Employees and that have not been satisfied or waived as of the
Effective Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; and (ii)
provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any Parent Benefit Plan that
is a welfare benefit plan in which such Continuing Employees may be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time.

(e) To the extent any employee notification or consultation requirements are
imposed by applicable Legal Requirements with respect to any of the
Contemplated Transactions, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each
other to ensure that such requirements are complied with prior to the
Effective Time.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall ensure that
its Subsidiaries and the respective Representatives of the Alaska Corporations
do not, make any commitment to any employees of the Alaska Corporations
regarding continuing post-Closing employment, including post-Closing employee
benefits and compensation, without the prior written approval of Parent, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(g) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring the Alaska
Corporations to continue any specific Company Employee Plan. The provisions of
this Section 6.4 are for the sole benefit of Parent and the Company and
nothing in this Section 6.4, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be
construed to constitute an amendment of any Company Employee Plan (or an
undertaking to amend any such plan) or other compensation and benefits plan
maintained for or provided to Company Employees, including Continuing
Employees, prior to, on or following the Effective Time.

 



60 6.5 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities by the Company or its Subsidiaries existing in favor of
those Persons who are current or former directors or officers of the Company
or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time (the "Company
Indemnified Persons") for their acts and omissions as directors,
officers, employees or agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring
prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as
provided in any indemnification agreements between the Company and said
Company Indemnified Persons (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement),
shall survive the Merger and be observed and performed by the Surviving
Corporation and any applicable Subsidiaries to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable law for a period of six years from the date on which the Merger
becomes effective. Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of current and former
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently
set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and
such Subsidiaries, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any Person benefited by such provisions without such persons
prior written consent. Parent guarantees the full and timely performance of
the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries under this
Section 6.5(a).

 

(b) At or prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall purchase a
directors and officers liability insurance "tail policy" with a claims
period of six years from the Acceptance Time, and on terms and conditions no
less favorable to the Company Indemnified Parties than those in effect under
the Company Existing DandO Policy in effect on the date hereof, for the benefit
of the Company Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company or its Subsidiaries
occurring prior to the Effective Time. If such "tail policy" is not obtained
then from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of
the Company Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy
of directors and officers and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company as of the date of this Agreement in the form delivered or Made
Available by the Company to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement (the
"Company Existing DandO Policy"), to the extent that directors and officers
liability insurance coverage is commercially available; _provided, however,_
that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Company Existing
DandO Policy a policy or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the
Company Existing DandO Policy (or for any substitute policies) in excess of
$1.05 million (the "Company Maximum Premium"). In the event any future
annual premiums for the Company Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute
policies) exceed the Company Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Company Existing DandO
Policy (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be
obtained for a premium equal to the Company Maximum Premium.

 



61 (c) Parent shall pay (as incurred) all expenses, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel, which any Company Indemnified Person may incur in
enforcing the indemnification and other obligations provided for in this
Section 6.5.

(d) This Section 6.5 is intended to be (i) for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Persons, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their successors and assigns, (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any Company
Indemnified Person may have by contract or otherwise, including
indemnification agreements that the Company has entered into with any of its
directors or officers and (iii) may not be amended, altered or repealed after
the Acceptance Time without the prior written consent of the affected
Company Indemnified Person (provided that such amendment, alteration or
repeal prior to the Acceptance Time shall be governed by Section 9.1). In the
event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or
assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each case, Parent (or its successor, as
applicable), shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent (as the case may be) honor the
indemnification and other obligations set forth in this Section 6.5. This
Section 6.5 shall survive consummation of the Merger.

6.6 Regulatory Approvals and Related Matters.

(a) Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other
documents required to be filed by such party with any Governmental Body with
respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and
to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such
Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the

required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any Antitrust
Filings, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, will promptly inform the
other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable
Governmental Body such amendment or supplement. Each of the Company and Parent
shall give the other party prompt notice of the commencement or known threat
of commencement of any Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental
Body with respect to the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions, keep the other party reasonably informed as to the status of any
such Legal Proceeding or threat, and in connection with any such Legal
Proceeding, each of the Company or Parent will permit authorized

each Consent (if any) required to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable
Legal Requirement or Contract, or otherwise) by such party in connection with
the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Contemplated Transactions; and (iii)
shall use reasonable best efforts to lift any restraint, injunction or other
legal bar to the Offer or the Merger.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.6,
neither Parent, Merger Sub or the Company shall have any obligation under
this Agreement to divest or agree to divest (or cause any of its Subsidiaries
to divest or agree to divest) any of its respective material businesses,
material product lines or material assets, or to take or agree to take (or
cause any of its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take) any other material
action or agree (or cause any of its Subsidiaries to agree) to any material
limitation or material restriction on any of its respective material

such statements are consistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made jointly by the parties (or
individually, if approved by the other party), (ii) a party may issue any such
press release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be
required by Legal Requirement or the rules and regulations of the NASDAQ

Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) following a Company Change in
Recommendation, then the Company shall pay to Parent, in cash at the time

Company is the party terminating this Agreement, and (B) refunded such
