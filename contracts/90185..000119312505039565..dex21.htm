(iv) Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Sellers that it has delivered to
Sellers a true, accurate and complete copy of the DandT Valuation Report.

Article VII and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that, by their

2.4 _Final Determination of Purchase Price_.



(a) (i) CSL shall deliver to Buyer at least six Business Days prior to the
Closing a closing statement (the " _Estimated Closing Purchase Price
Certificate_ ") setting forth the calculation of CSLs good faith estimate of
the Purchase Price (the " _CSL Price Estimate_ "), including a detailed
presentation of the calculations of the items comprising Closing Net Cash and
Closing Net Working Capital, which calculations shall be prepared using
accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures, classifications and
estimation methodologies as set forth on _Schedule 2.4(a)_  (" _Accounting
Procedures_ "). Buyer shall deliver to CSL in writing no later than three
Business Days after its receipt of Estimated Closing Purchase Price
Certificate a notice (an " _Estimated Purchase Price Objection Notice_ ")
reasonably describing (giving consideration to the time period and information
 



 

16  available to Buyer for such review) any good faith objections it may have to
the CSL Price Estimate as set forth on the Estimated Closing Purchase
Price Certificate and its reasons therefor together with the calculation of
Buyers good faith estimate of the Purchase Price (the " _Buyer Price
Estimate_ "), including a detailed presentation of its calculations of the
items comprising Closing Net Cash and Closing Net Working Capital, which
calculations shall be prepared using the same Accounting Procedures as were
used to determine the Reference Working Capital, as set forth on Schedule
2.4(a).



(ii) If Buyer fails to deliver to CSL an Estimated Purchase Price Objection
Notice within three Business Days of its receipt of the Estimated Closing
Purchase Price Certificate, then the CSL Price Estimate as set forth on the
Estimated Closing Purchase Price Certificate shall be the "Closing
Date Purchase Price Amount" for purposes of Section 2.3(b).



(iii) If Buyer delivers to CSL an Estimated Purchase Price Objection Notice
within three Business Days of its receipt of the Estimate Closing Purchase
Price Certificate, then CSL and Buyer shall work together in good faith to
resolve any disagreements relating to the calculation of the Estimated
Purchase Price set forth on the Estimated Closing Price Certificate. Each of
CSL and Buyer shall also have the opportunity to revise their respective Price
Estimates, including any revisions necessary to bring that difference to less
than U.S. $10,000,000, and no such revisions shall in any event constitute an
admission against interest, admission that the CSL Price Estimate or Buyer
Price Estimate delivered in accordance with Section 2.4(a)(i) was not
calculated in good faith, or estoppel or waiver of any rights, arguments,
positions taken in such process, nor shall any such revision limit the
positions that may be taken by the parties in the final determination of
Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.4(b). If CSL and Buyer are unable
to resolve any disputes as to the calculations of the Purchase Price as set
forth on the Estimated Closing Purchase Price Certificate and
Estimated Purchase Price Objection Notice, then the "Closing Date Purchase
Price Amount" for purposes of Section 2.3(b) shall be determined as follows:



(A) if the difference between the CSL Price Estimate and the Buyer Price
Estimate is U.S. $10,000,000 or less, then the "Closing Date Purchase Price
Amount" for purposes of Section 2.3(b) shall be the average of the CSL Price
Estimate and Buyer Price Estimate; and



(B) if the difference between the CSL Price Estimate and the Buyer Price
Estimate is greater than U.S. $10,000,000, then the "Closing Date Purchase
Price Amount" for purposes of Section 2.3(b) shall be the lower of the CSL
Price Estimate and the Buyer Price Estimate, and an amount equal to the
difference between the CSL Price Estimate and the Buyer Price Estimate shall
be deposited by Buyer into an escrow account in accordance with Section 2.5.



(b) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 60 days following the
Closing Date, CSL shall prepare (in consultation with Thorpe Pehrson, if he
shall then be employed by the Operating Companies or another designee of
Buyer if Thorpe Pehrson is not then employed by the Operating Companies) and
deliver to Buyer a Closing Date Balance Sheet and CSLs certificate, derived
from the Closing Date Balance Sheet, setting forth in reasonable detail
the  



 

17  calculation of the Closing Net Cash and the Closing Net Working Capital and
the difference, if any, between the Purchase Price as determined in
accordance with the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Purchase
Price Amount delivered in accordance with Section 2.3(b) (the " _Closing
Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate_ "). The Closing Date Balance Sheet and
the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Procedures, and shall be delivered together
with a report thereon of Ernst and Young (" _CSL s Accountants_") that such
statement fairly presents in all material respects the Closing Net Cash and
the Closing Net Working Capital of the Companies determined in conformity with
such Accounting Procedures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, in all events the same Accounting Procedures shall be used to
calculate both the Reference Working Capital and the Closing Net Working
Capital as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.4, and if for
any reason the Accounting Procedures used to calculate the Closing Net
Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with this Section 2.4 are
required by GAAP applied on a consistent basis to differ from the Accounting
Procedures that were used to calculate the Reference Working Capital in
accordance with the procedures set forth on Schedule 2.4(a), then the
Reference Working Capital shall be re-calculated using the same Accounting
Procedures as are used to determine the Closing Net Working Capital as finally
determined in accordance with this Section 2.4, and the adjustment to the
Purchase Price contemplated by Section 2.1(b)(ii) shall be calculated based on
the Reference Working Capital as so recalculated; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Sellers shall not realize an increase in the Purchase Price as a
result of any failure properly to apply the Accounting Procedures, including
GAAP applied on a consistent basis, in originally calculating the Reference
Working Capital. In connection with the preparation of the Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment Certificate, Buyer shall and shall cause the Companies to
provide the Sellers and the Sellers authorized representatives with full
access to the books, records, facilities and employees of the Company and to

Closing Net Cash amounts and the Closing Net Working Capital.



(d) Buyer may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing Purchase Price
Adjustment Certificate or the calculation of Closing Net Cash or the Closing
Net Working Capital, but only on the basis of its belief that the amounts
reflected on the Closing Purchase Price Adjustment Certificate were not
arrived at in accordance with this Agreement or resulted from a mistake of
fact, failure to comply with the Accounting Procedures, including GAAP
applied on a consistent basis, or other inaccuracy contained in the Closing
Date Balance Sheet or elsewhere; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall
have notified CSL in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount
thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such
dispute, within 60 days of CSLs delivery to Buyer of the Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment Certificate. In the event of such a dispute, CSL and Buyer
shall work together in good faith to resolve any disagreements. If CSL and

will inform Deloitte and Touche of the final Purchase Price promptly after its
determination, and in no event later than five Business Days after it is
deemed final pursuant to this Section 2.4(e).



(f) If the final calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.4(b)-(e) is less than the Closing Date Purchase Price Amount paid to Sellers
in accordance with Section 2.3(b), (i) Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the absolute value of such difference and (ii) Buyer shall be
entitled to receive all amounts held in the Escrow Account. In the event that
the final calculation of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4(b)-(e) is

with Section 2.3(b), then Buyer shall pay to CSL, on behalf of all of the
Sellers, the absolute value of such difference (and Buyer may use amounts
held in the Escrow Account, if any, for such purpose). Any payment made in
accordance with this Section 2.4(f), and any payment made in accordance with

all tax, accounting and other reporting purposes as an adjustment to the

(10) Business Days after the Closing Purchase Price Certificate and the
calculation of the Purchase Price (including the adjustments contemplated by

2.4(e), and (ii) by causing such payments to be credited in
immediately available funds to such bank account or accounts as may be
designated by the receiving party in accordance with wire transfer
instructions delivered in writing not less than two Business Days prior to
transfer (and in the case of payments to be made to CSL, in accordance with
the instructions used to deliver the Closing Date Purchase Price Amount).
Other than payments made from the Escrow Account (which shall bear interest as
set forth in the Escrow Agreement), any payment to be made pursuant to
Section 2.4(f) shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date but
excluding the date of payment at a rate of 5 1/4 _%._ Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days for which interest is due.

 



2.5 _Escrow_. If in accordance with Section 2.4(a) Buyer is obligated to
deposit an amount into an escrow account, then the parties shall enter into an
Escrow Agreement in the form of _Schedule 2.5_ hereto (the " _Escrow

any such plan by virtue of being a member of a controlled group or under
common control with an employer which contributes to or contributed to any
such plan. The Company does not maintain, contribute to, or has any obligation
to contribute to or has ever maintained or contributed to or is or was a party
to a "multiemployer plan" as that term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA,

Seller, threatened legal action, proceeding or investigation, suit, grievance,
arbitration or other manner of litigation, or claim against or relating to the

action, proceeding or investigation, suit grievance, arbitration or other
manner of litigation, or claim, other than routine claims for benefits. To the

Code) with respect to such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could
give rise to a tax or penalty imposed by Section 4975 of the U.S. Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA. To the Knowledge of Seller, none of the Sellers or
the Companies or any of their directors, officers, employees or any
plan fiduciary has any liability for failure to comply with ERISA or the U.S.
Code or any other law or ruling or regulation for failure to act in connection
with the administration or investment of any U.S. Company Plan. To the

member of a controlled group with a person who has liability under ERISA or
the U.S. Code.

reflect all of such liabilities in a manner satisfying the requirements of
Financial Accounting Standards 87 and 88. The statements of assets and
liabilities of the U.S. Company Plans as of the end of the most recent three
fiscal years for which information is available, and the statements of changes
in fund balances, financial position and Net Assets available for benefits
under such U.S. Company Plans for such fiscal years, copies of which have
been certified by the Sellers and furnished to the Buyer, fairly represent the
financial condition of such U.S. Company Plans as of such date and the results
of operations thereof for the year ended on such date, all in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis, and the actuarial assumptions used for
funding purposes have not been changed since the last written report of
actuaries on such U.S. Company Plans, which written reports have been
furnished to the Buyer.

Competing Business without the prior written consent of Buyer, or (ii) own an
interest in, manage, or operate, any Person that engages in a Competing

that, for the purposes of this Section 5.2(a), _(x)_ ownership or control of a
Person who derives less than five percent (5%) of its gross revenue from the
operation of a Competing Business shall in no event constitute a violation of
this Section 5.2(a), _(y)_ ownership of securities having no more than five

Kingdom or Europe or traded in any over-the-counter securities market located

50 (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that the non-competition covenant set
out in Section 5.2(a) (the " _Restraint_ ") is for the protection of the
goodwill of the Buyer in the JRH Business following the Closing. If any part
of the Restraint is judged to go beyond what is reasonable in the
circumstances and necessary to protect the goodwill of the Buyer in the JRH
Business following the Closing, but would be judged reasonable and necessary

Restraint applies with that activity deleted or period or area reduced by the
minimum amount necessary to make the Restraint more reasonable in the
circumstances.

otherwise inconsistent with, the Buyers right in JRH Intellectual Property;
or

(a) The Parties agree to make all necessary or appropriate filings to obtain

necessary under applicable Law or as requested by any Governmental Entity in
order to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.1; _provided_ ,
_however_ : that Buyer shall not be required to offer, take or agree to any
actions in connection with, or agree to, any separate order, sale, divestiture
or disposition of plants, assets or businesses; and _provided_ _further_ that
no Company shall divest or dispose of any plants, assets or businesses
pursuant to the obligations of this Section 5.3 without the prior consent of
Buyer, which consent may be withheld in Buyers sole discretion.



5.4 _Third Party Consents_. Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain promptly, or to cause their Affiliates to obtain promptly,
the consents waivers, approvals and authorizations from third parties (that

required to pay any material consideration or incur any material costs or
expenses (other than fees and expenses of legal  



 

51  counsel engaged for such purpose and _de minimis_ out-of-pocket expenses).

Agreement unless such consent, waiver, approval or authorization is included
in Article VI.

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of
information, Sellers and Buyer shall have the right to review in advance, and
to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Affiliates, that appear in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this Section 5.5(a) shall require Buyer to provide to any
Seller any filing made by Buyer under the HSR Act or other applicable
antitrust Laws. In exercising the foregoing right, each of Seller and Buyer
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.



(b) Sellers and Buyer shall each, upon request by the other, furnish
the other with all information concerning itself and its Affiliates and such
other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Sellers
or Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by

hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to such transactions. Neither Sellers nor Buyer shall
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless such party consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Seller shall be permitted to attend or
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filing made under the HSR Act or other applicable antitrust Laws without the
prior written approval of Buyer.



5.6 _Access and Information_.



(a) After the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall permit

regular business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the properties,

for inventory of finished products held by each Company, and to the officers
and  



 

52  operating level employees, auditors, investment bankers, counsel,
environmental consultants and other representatives of the Companies, in each
case, as Buyer shall from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access shall be permitted (after consultation with
the senior management of the Companies) in such a manner as would not
reasonably be expected to interfere with the operation of the JRH Business;
_provided_ , _further_ , that Buyer shall reimburse Sellers promptly for all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Sellers or the
Companies in complying with any such request by or on behalf of Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers need not disclose to Buyer or its

or other agreement or arrangement to which a Seller or any of its Affiliates
is a party.

undertake intrusive environmental sampling on any of the Real Property without
the prior written consent of Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any property
damage, loss, cost or expense arising out of the conduct of any such
investigations; _provided_ , _however_ , that with regard to any such pre-
Closing samplings or investigations, Buyer shall have no indemnity obligations
to the extent any such property damage, loss, cost or expense is caused by
the acts or omissions of any Seller or Company and Buyer shall not be
responsible for any Hazardous Substance which Buyer did not bring onto the
Real Property, nor for any and all subsequent releases thereof or violations
of Laws resulting therefrom. Further, after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not contact any Governmental Entity regarding the
status of the Companies compliance with any Laws without providing Sellers
with prior written notice of its intent to contact each such Governmental
Entity and providing Sellers with the reasonable opportunity to participate in
any such meeting or discussion and without obtaining the prior
written consent of CSL, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.



(c) All Confidential Information provided or obtained pursuant to Section
5.6(a) shall be held by Buyer in accordance with and subject to the terms of
the Confidentiality Deed, dated August 4, 2004, by Buyer in favor of CSL (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").



(d) Following the Closing, for so long as such information is retained by
Buyer, or any of the Companies (which shall be for a period of at least seven
(7) years), Buyer shall permit Sellers and their authorized representatives to
have reasonable access and duplicating rights during normal business hours,
upon reasonable prior notice to Buyer, to the books, records and personnel
relating to the JRH Business prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that
such access may be reasonably required in connection with (i) the preparation
of Sellers Tax Returns or accounting records or with any audits, (ii) any
suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation relating to the JRH Business,

Buyer, or the Companies in connection with any such request. The Sellers
shall be permitted to retain duplicate copies of records relating to Taxes,

necessary to refer to in connection with any Tax audit by the IRS or another
Tax authority (including, without limitation, the relevant tax authorities in
Australia and the UK).



 

53 (e) Following the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall instruct its and the
Companies employees to, at Sellers request, cooperate with Sellers as may
be reasonably required in connection with the investigation and defense of any
suit, claim, action, proceeding or investigation relating to the JRH Business
that is brought against any Seller or any of its respective Affiliates at any
time after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall reimburse
Buyer promptly for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Buyer, or the Companies in connection with any such request.

following the Closing Date. Such elections shall be effective no later than

harmless with respect to any entity classification elections made for JRH/UK
and JRH/Australia requested by Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.8. 



5.9 _Labor Matters, WARN, TULCRA_.



(a) Buyer shall not, and shall cause any Company not to, at any time prior to
the 61st day following the Closing Date, without fully complying with the
notice and other requirements of the U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 (" _WARN Act_ ") or without fully complying with
the collective consultation requirements under the (UK) Trade Union and
Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (" _TULCRA_ "), if applicable,
effectuate (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any
site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any
site of employment of any Company, or (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined in the
WARN Act) affecting any site of employment of any Company. Buyer also shall
not, and shall cause any Company not to, without fully complying with the
notice and other requirements of the applicable Law in Australia, the UK,
and/or the European Union, effectuate modifications to the facilities or
reduce or change the terms of employment of the Companies employees in
Australia and the UK, as applicable.



(b) If Buyer takes any action within 180 days after the Closing Date which
independently, or in connection with any reduction in the size of the
Companies work force occurring within the ninety-day period prior to the
Closing Date, could be construed as a "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as
those terms are defined in the WARN Act or any action covered in the United
Kingdom by TULCRA, Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing any notice
required by the WARN Act or under TULCRA and for making payments, if any, and

54 5.10 _Intentionally Omitted_.



5.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) As of the Closing Date, all employees of the Companies shall cease to
participate in any Company Plan where employees other than the employees of
the Companies also participate. Upon the Buyers request, the Companies and
the Sellers shall terminate any Company Plans that cover only employees of the
Companies prior to the Closing Date. All participants and former participants
in any Company Plan that is an employee pension benefit plan as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA shall become fully vested in their benefits under such
employee pension benefit plan. As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companies to,
enroll such persons who were employees of the Companies immediately prior to
the Closing Date and who continue to be employees of the Companies or the
Buyer following the Closing Date, other than Thomas Giarla (" _Continuing
Employees_ ") and employees of Sellers set forth on Section 5.11(e) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule (" _Transferred Employees_ ") in the Buyers
employee benefit plans for which such employees are eligible (" _Buyer Plans_
") on the same terms as which the Buyers similarly situated employees
participate. However, Buyer shall provide hourly Continuing Employees and
Transferred Employees of the Companies with long term disability benefits
through the close of the current fiscal year (June 30, 2005) under the
existing Company welfare benefit plans providing such benefits. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, Buyer shall cause Continuing Employees and
Transferred Employees to be given credit under each Buyer Plan in which such
employees are eligible to participate, as determined above, for all service
with the Sellers, the Companies, and their Affiliates for all purposes to the
extent permitted under each Buyer Plan and except to the extent such service
credit would result in the duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, this Section shall not operate to duplicate any
benefit provided to any Continuing Employee or to fund any such benefit.
Although Continuing Employees and Transferred Employees shall accrue vacation
leave according to the vacation policy of the Buyer, each Continuing Employee
and Transferred Employee shall be grandfathered with respect to their annual
vacation leave earned as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to Australian Employees (but not including non- employee
directors or former employees) and CSL Secondees, Buyer shall comply with
_Schedule C_ (the " _Australian Benefit/Employment Addendum_ "), and with
respect to UK Employees (but not including non-employee directors or former
employees) and employees currently employed by JRH/US, this Section 5.11(a)
shall be subject to the additional provisions of Section 5.11(d). Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer shall assume responsibility for
continuation coverage compliance under COBRA for Continuing Employees
and Transferred Employees.



(b) If the Continuing Employees or the Transferred Employees become eligible
to participate in any medical, dental or other welfare plan of Buyer or the
Companies, Buyer shall cause such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations for conditions covered under the applicable Company Plans or
Seller employee benefit plans covering such employees at the Closing Date and
(ii) honor any deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the employees
and their beneficiaries under the applicable Company Plans or Seller employee
benefit plans during the portion of the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs that precedes the Closing Date. If the Continuing Employees or
Transferred Employees become eligible to participate in a group term life
insurance plan maintained by Buyer, or the Companies, to the extent permitted
thereunder, Buyer shall cause such plan to waive any medical certification for
such employees up to the amount of coverage the employees had under the life
insurance plan covering such employees at the Closing  



 

55  Date (but subject to any limits on the maximum amount of coverage under
Buyers, Companies life insurance plan). In addition, prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers shall cause the accounts of any employee of the
Operating Companies participating in a flexible benefit plan to be transferred
into a separate and comparable plan (which may be Buyers Plan if directed by
Buyer) and Buyer shall assume the obligations under such plan on the Closing
Date.



(c) The Buyer shall provide to any Continuing Employee and Transferred
Employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated without cause or made
redundant on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date with
severance benefits in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
Companies severance policy as amended and restated December 2004, including,
if applicable, the minimum severance benefit of twelve (12) weeks (" _Normal
Severance Benefit_ ") unless such employee is a party to a retention or
employment agreement providing severance benefits. If a Continuing Employee
and/or Transferred Employee is a party to a retention or employment agreement
previously disclosed by Seller to Buyer, which provides for severance
benefits, Buyer shall provide severance benefits in accordance with the terms
of such agreement.



(d) With respect to the U.S. Company Plan that is a qualified retirement plan
under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, prior to the Closing Date
(the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") and if requested by Buyer, Sellers shall
effect a termination or partial termination and cause the account balance of
each Continuing Employee and Transferred Employee to be 100% vested. Buyer
shall provide retirement benefits to Continuing Employees and Transferred
Employees under Buyers Plans. Buyer shall also designate a tax-qualified
defined contribution plan of the Buyer (" _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ ") that either
(i) currently provides for the receipt from Continuing Employees and
Transferred Employees of "eligible rollover distributions" (as such term is
defined under Section 402 of the Code) or (ii) shall be amended as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date to provide for the receipt from such
eligible rollover distributions. If Buyer requests a termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan, each Continuing Employee and Transferred Employee who is
a participant in the Company 401(k) Plan shall be given the opportunity to
receive a distribution of his or her account balance and shall be given the
opportunity to elect to "roll over" such account balance to the Buyer 401(k)
Plan, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of such plan and
applicable Law. Either of CSL/US or JRH/US, as applicable, shall provide Buyer
with copies of any personnel and other records pertaining to the Transferred
Employees and such records of any agent or representative of CSL/US or JRH/US,
as applicable, pertaining to the Transferred Employees and the Company 401(k)
Plan as Buyer may reasonably request in order to administer and manage the
accounts and assets rolled over to the Buyer 401(k) Plan. With respect to UK
Employees (but not including non-employee directors or former employees),
Buyer shall participate, or provide participation, in the Scottish Widows
Scheme or provide a private retirement benefit of comparative scope.



(e) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 5.11(e) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, at or prior to the Closing, the Companies will
continue the employment of all of the employees of Sellers employed in the JRH
Business.



(f) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Sellers shall pay to
each Transferred Employee who participates in the Companies GoalSharing Plan
(the " _GoalSharing Plan_ "), a cash amount equal to the pro rata bonus amount
accrued under the GoalSharing Plan for the current bonus period through the
Closing Date. Through the close of the current fiscal year  



 

56  (June 30, 2005), Buyer shall maintain a bonus program that is economically
comparable on an aggregate basis to the GoalSharing Plan, provided that
Buyer shall have the sole discretion to determine performance goals, bonus
targets and payout of any bonus amounts.



(g) Buyer shall assume on the Closing Date all liabilities associated with the
provision of medical benefits after retirement to Jim Atkinson, Gerald
Cox, Arlene Lesher and Raquel Sweet pursuant to any existing or former
policy, plan or contractual obligation of the Companies.



(h) With the exception of any applicable severance payments and outplacement
services, CSL shall on the Closing Date assume all obligations of
the Companies to all employees of the Companies with respect to the payment
of retention, completion-of-project and any other incentive bonuses, the
payment of which is contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing hereunder.

exercise by CSL of its rights to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 7.1 shall be binding upon and effective as to each of the

the other party, if there shall be in effect any Law in Australia or the
United States or any Order in any jurisdiction anywhere that prohibits the
consummation of the Closing;



(c) by either Buyer or CSL (provided that the terminating party is not then
in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a material breach of any
of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Buyer or any Seller that has rendered the
satisfaction or any conditions contained in Article VI hereof impossible, such
breach has not been waived by the terminating party, and such breach has not
been cured within 30 days following the terminating partys written notice to
the breaching party of such breach; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such
breach cannot reasonably be cured within 30 days and the breaching party is
diligently proceeding to cure such breach, this Agreement may not be
terminated pursuant to this Section 7.1(c); or



(d) by either Buyer or all Sellers, by giving written notice of such
termination to the other party, if the Closing shall not have occurred by May
31, 2005; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Buyer nor Sellers shall have
the right to terminate in accordance with this Section 7.1(d) after May 31,
2005 if the only conditions to Closing (other than those conditions that, by
their nature, can only be satisfied at Closing) that are not satisfied as
of May 31, 2005 is one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a),
and if one or more of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(a) is not

the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, equity holders, agents, legal and financial
advisors or other representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that if this

terminating partys right to pursue all legal remedies will survive such
termination unimpaired.

not apply to obligations or liabilities of JRH/US that arise against or are
chargeable to CSL/US on the basis of any doctrine allowing the parent of a
legal entity to be liable for its subsidiaries obligations _(e.g.,_ "piercing
the corporate veil") unless such obligations otherwise are indemnified by

any such excess;



(ii) for any individual occurrences, events, circumstances, acts or omissions
where the Loss relating thereto is less than U.S.$50,000 (or equivalent value)
and any such occurrences, events, circumstances, acts or omissions shall not

8.1(b); or provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that whenever multiple
situations exist at the same Real Property that give rise to a Loss or Losses
based on the same or similar set of related actions, inactions, facts or
circumstances, such multiple situations shall be aggregated to constitute a
single "individual item" for purposes of the preceding clause (for example,
the failure to maintain proper records for all inventory lots would not
constitute a separate item for each lot of inventory, but would be deemed a
single individual item giving rise to a single Loss in the aggregate amount of
all such failures);



 

67 (iii) for Losses in the aggregate in excess of U.S.$111,000,000 (or equivalent
value).

respect to Section 3.20 for those matters disclosed in Section 3.20 of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule) as follows:



(i) for any individual occurrence, event, circumstance, act or omission where
the Loss relating thereto is less than U.S.$50,000 (or equivalent value), and
any such occurrence, event, circumstance, act or omission shall not be taken
into account for purposes of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this Section 8.1(c);
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that whenever multiple situations exist
at the same Real Property that give rise to a Loss or Losses based on the same
or similar set of related actions, inactions, facts or circumstances, such
multiple situations shall be aggregated to constitute a single "individual
item" for purposes of the preceding clause (for example, the failure to obtain
more than one sample as required by the same discharge permit at the same Real
Property that leads to one notice of violation by a Governmental Authority
would not constitute a separate item for each cited violation within the
notice of violation but would be deemed a single individual item giving rise
to a single Loss in the aggregate amount of all such failures);

 



(ii) for more than 90% of each Dollar of Loss incurred by Buyer Indemnified
Parties with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.20; or



(iii) for an amount in excess of $55,500,000 (or equivalent value) in the
aggregate.



(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to any Losses arising by reason of any Releases of Hazardous
Substances or violations of Environmental Laws at the Swampbridge Road
Facility or the JRH Business operations thereat, including the presence or
removal of underground storage tanks from such Real Property and any Releases
from such underground storage tanks, Sellers indemnity to Buyer Indemnified
Parties under Section 8.1(c) shall not be limited in amount.



(e) CSL shall have no liability hereunder with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.7 to the extent that
the risk of any liability or obligation that is the subject of a claim for the
breach of the representations and warranties made in Section 3.7 is otherwise
allocated by this Agreement. 



8.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_.



(a) From and after the closing and subject to the provisions of this
Article VIII, Buyers shall indemnify Sellers and its directors, officers,
employees, affiliates (including officers and employees of such affiliates),
agents, representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold Seller Indemnified Parties harmless
from and against all Losses actually incurred by Seller Indemnified Party to
the extent relating to or arising out of the following:



(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement;



 

68 (ii) any breach of any covenant of Buyer set forth in this Agreement; and



(iii) all debts, liabilities and other obligations of the Companies other
than in respect of those matters described in Section 8.1(a).



(b) Buyer shall not be required to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party, and
shall not have any liability under clause (ii) of Section 8.2(a), for any
individual occurrences, events, circumstances, acts or omissions where the
Loss relating thereto is less than U.S.$50,000 (or equivalent value);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the limitation set forth in this Section 8.2(b)
shall not apply with respect to the Losses arising in connection with
Buyers breach of any of its covenants set forth in Article II, any Sections
of Article V other than Sections 5.5, 5.6 and 5.15, Article IX, any other
covenant on the part of Buyer to pay or reimburse money to Seller Indemnified
Party, and any such occurrences, events, circumstances, acts or omissions
shall not be taken into account for purposes of clauses (i) of this Section
8.2(b).



8.3 _Calculation of Losses_.



(a) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article VIII or Article IX shall be net of any amounts recovered by
the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under insurance policies after
adjustment for future increases in premiums on other amounts payable by the
Indemnified Party or reimbursement provided by any Governmental Entity or
other Person with respect to such Loss, and shall be adjusted to take account
of the actual amount of any Tax benefit or Tax detriment realized by the
Indemnified Party or any Affiliate or group of Affiliates of such Indemnified
Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss. In computing
the amount of any such Tax benefit or Tax detriment, the Indemnified Party
shall be deemed to recognize and receive items of loss deduction or credit
resulting from the Loss giving rise to indemnification upon
actual recognition of such loss deduction or credit; further, to the extent
that the Indemnified Party cannot utilize any Tax benefit with respect to a
Loss in the Tax period of such Loss or in the Tax period any indemnification
payment for such Loss is received, the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for the amount of such Tax benefit upon actual utilization
of such Tax benefit by the Indemnified Party. Such payment for reimbursement
shall be made to the Indemnifying Party within ten Business Days of the
utilization of such Tax benefit.



(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
indemnification shall be provided for under this Article VIII or Article IX in
respect of any special or punitive damages (other than punitive damages
sought, awarded or otherwise imposed in any Third-Party Claim).



(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties agree that
indemnifiable Losses (a) may include indirect and consequential damages so
long as such damages (i) were reasonably foreseeable and (ii) proximately
resulted from the events and circumstances giving rise to the Losses, (b)
exclude punitive damages (but include punitive damages sought, awarded or
otherwise imposed in any Third-Party Claim) and (c) exclude Taxes payable by
an Indemnified Party as a result of any indemnification payment under this
Agreement being treated by  



 

69  the relevant Taxing Authority as income; provided that in no event shall CSL
be obligated to indemnify Buyer with respect to indirect or
consequential damages in excess of U.S.$25,000,000 (other than in respect of
indirect and consequential damage arising with respect to a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.18
and 3.35, as to which breaches there will be no limit on the amount of
indirect or consequential damages that may be recovered by Buyer).



8.4 _Termination of Indemnification_. The Indemnifying Partys obligations to
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party shall terminate when the
applicable representation, warranty or covenant under which such claim for
indemnification arises terminates pursuant to Section 8.7; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligation to indemnify and hold harmless shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which the Indemnified Party
shall have in good faith before the expiration of the applicable period,
previously made a claim by delivering a notice of such claim (in accordance
with the terms of Section 8.5) to the Indemnifying Party.



8.5 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.



(a) In order for any Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement arising out of a claim made by any Person
against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified
Party must notify the Indemnifying Party in writing (and in reasonable
detail) of the Third-Party Claim promptly (but in no event more than 10 days)
following receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party
Claim. The failure to so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
any liability it (or they) may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure
does not prejudice the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.



 

(b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its responsibility to indemnify
the Indemnified Party as provided in this Agreement with respect to Losses
incurred by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may elect to assume control of the defense of such Third-
Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Partys expense with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that such counsel is not
reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying
Party so elect to assume control of the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnifying Party),
at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying
Party (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense). The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to reimbursement for all
costs, fees and expenses (including the fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the Indemnified Party) for any period during which the Indemnifying Party
has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any period in which the
Indemnified Party shall have failed to give notice of the Third-Party Claim
as provided above). If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a
Third-Party Claim, all the Indemnified Parties shall, at the Indemnifying
Partys cost, cooperate in all material respects in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such  



 

70  cooperation at the Indemnifying Partys cost shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party of records and information that are reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party or that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim,
and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis during normal
business hours to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third-Party Claim, (x) the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge such Third-
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, not to be
unreasonably withheld, and (y) the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
Indemnified Partys prior written consent, admit any liability with respect
to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim on a basis that
would result in the imposition of a judgment that would restrict the future
activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any subsidiary or affiliate
thereof.



(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against the
Indemnifying Party under Section 8.1 that does not involve a Third-Party Claim
being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party,
the Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim promptly (but in no
event more than 30 days) following discovery by the Indemnified Party of such
claim to the Indemnifying Party. The failure to so notify shall not relieve
the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
if such failure does not prejudice the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying
Party disputes its liability with respect to such claim, prior to any partys
seeking any relief at law, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute for a
period of at least 60 days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of the
Indemnified Partys notice.



(d) Any valid claim for indemnification under this Agreement shall
describe the claim in reasonable detail, include copies of any material
written evidence thereof and indicate the estimated amount of such claim.



(e) Each Indemnified Party shall make commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any claim of liability that an Indemnified Party asserts under
this Article VIII. In the event that an Indemnified Party shall fail to make
such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or liability, then
notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained herein, CSL shall not
be required to indemnify any Indemnified Party for any Loss that could
reasonably be expected to have been avoided if the Indemnified Party had made
such efforts. All costs of mitigation and all damages to an Indemnified Party
related thereto shall be the liability of the Indemnifying Party.



8.6 _Additional Procedures Relating to Environmental Matters_.



(a) Each party agrees that it shall not and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that each of its Affiliates shall not, directly
or indirectly, communicate orally or in writing with any Governmental Entity
relating to any actual or potential liability under Environmental Law for
which the other party may be responsible under this Agreement; except for any
Legitimate Business Purpose or to the extent that Buyer or any Seller believes
in good faith that such communication is required by any Environmental Law
and except in response to an inquiry or other request for information from any
Governmental Entity. For the purposes hereof, " _Legitimate Business Purpose_
" shall mean work (i) to maintain or achieve compliance with an Environmental
Law, (ii) to respond to a Release that violates or would violate applicable
Environmental Law, (iii) to minimize offsite exposure from a Release, (iv) in
response to threatened or actual enforcement  



 

71  action, investigation, proceeding or claim by a Governmental Entity or third
person, or (v) to reasonably maintain, improve, expand, remove or
replace equipment, utilities, buildings or other improvements.



(b) To the extent Buyer seeks indemnification for any Loss arising out of or
associated with an Environmental matter, Buyer will provide CSL with written
notice of each such Loss and the opportunity to assume the lead in conducting
negotiations with any third party and to investigate or remedy any such
matter if Sellers acknowledge responsibility to indemnify Buyer with respect
to Losses connected with such matter as provided in this Agreement.



(c) Regardless of which of Buyer or CSL assumes the lead role (the " _Lead_
_Party_ "; and the other of Buyer or CSL that does not assume the lead role
being referred to as the " _Non-Lead Party_ ") in addressing or defending
against any environmental matter regarding which CSL has an indemnification
obligation arising under this Agreement, Buyer and CSL shall follow the
following procedural requirements:



(i) In undertaking Remedial Action with respect to Releases of Hazardous
Substances on, under or arising from the Real Property or at properties
currently owned by third parties, and except as otherwise provided in Section
8.6(c)(iii) and (iv);



(A) To the extent reasonably necessary to pursue Remedial Actions, the Lead
Party shall retain qualified, independent environmental consultant(s), which
consultant(s) shall be subject to the Non-Lead Partys approval (such approval
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);



 

(B) The Lead Party shall provide to the Non-Lead Party, for the Non-Lead
Partys review and comment, drafts of any proposed work plans, reports or
other submissions for any Remedial Action that the Lead Party intends to
deliver or submit to the appropriate Governmental Entity prior to said
submission (in the event a Governmental Entity is not involved in the Remedial
Action, this requirement shall apply to any work plans the Lead Party desires
to implement). The Non-Lead Party shall have 14 days to provide comments to
the Lead Party regarding any such draft submissions, unless such review period
is not reasonably possible within the schedule or due date established by the
Governmental Entity, in which case the Lead Party shall endeavor to provide
the Non-Lead Party as much time as reasonably possible under the schedule (up
to the 14 days) for its review. Such review and comments shall be at the Non-
Lead Partys own expense. The Lead Party shall give good faith consideration
to the Non-Lead Partys comments regarding such draft submissions;



(C) The Lead Party shall promptly provide copies to the Non-Lead Party of all
written notices, final submissions, final work plans and final reports;



(D) The Lead Party shall provide the Non-Lead Party with reasonable advance
notice of all planned meetings and telephone conferences with applicable
Governmental Entity(ies) and the Non-Lead Party, at its own expense, shall
have the right to send representatives to attend and participate in such
meetings;



 

72 (E) The Non-Lead Party may, at its own expense, hire its own consultants,
attorneys or other professionals to monitor the Remedial Action, including
any field work undertaken by the Lead Party, and the Lead Party and Non-Lead
Party shall share with each other the results of all such field work; and



(F) Notwithstanding the above, the Non-Lead Party shall not take any actions
that shall unreasonably interfere with the Lead Partys Performance of the
Remedial Action.



(ii) With respect to any claims for indemnification related violations of
applicable Environmental Law, other than matters that involve a Remedial
Action with respect to the Release of Hazardous Substances on the Real
Property:



(A) Buyer shall be the Lead Party for all Remedial Actions under this Section
8.6(c)(ii); provided, that Buyer will provide CSL with the opportunity to be
the Lead Party for all Remedial Actions under this Section 8.6(c)(ii) in
connection with violations of applicable Environmental Law at the Swampbridge
Road Facility if Sellers acknowledge responsibility to indemnify Buyer
with respect to Losses connected with such matters as provided in this
Agreement.



(B) To the extent reasonably necessary to pursue Remedial Actions, the Lead
Party shall retain qualified, independent environmental consultant(s), which
consultant(s) shall be subject to the Non-Lead Partys approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);



(C) The Lead Party shall have the right, consistent with applicable
Environmental Law, to determine and implement the appropriate
Remedial Actions to correct any failures to comply with applicable
Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing Date. The Lead Party shall
consult with the Non-Lead Party in all material respects in connection with
undertaking such Remedial Actions, shall provide the Non-Lead Party with
copies of all correspondence submitted to and received by any Governmental
Authorities with respect to such matters and shall provide the Non-Lead Party
with a reasonable opportunity to comment on any material submissions to
Governmental Entities with respect to such matter, including Remedial Action
proposals;



(D) Without limiting the foregoing, CSL shall not be obligated to indemnify
Buyer for costs incurred in connection with implementation of Remedial
Actions that are in excess of the costs that would be incurred to achieve
compliance with applicable Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing Date
in the most reasonably cost effective manner; provided that the selected
Remedial Action for purposes of this section shall be sufficient to allow the
Companies to operate the JRH Business at the effected Real Property in a
manner and at a level of production that is consistent with the operation of
such Real Property at the time of Closing. To the extent that the Buyer
chooses to implement a Remedial Action that goes beyond the standard set forth
above, including, without limitation, one that allows for an expansion in
operations at a property or that is required to achieve compliance with
Environmental Law that does not become applicable to a property until after
the Closing Date, the CSL shall not be responsible for the additional or
excess costs associated with such corrective action.



 

73 (E) For the avoidance of doubt, Remedial Actions contemplated by this Section
8.6(b)(ii) shall not include any Remedial Action related to Releases of
Hazardous Substances on, under or arising from the Real Property.



(iii) Where CSL assumes the role of Lead Party, CSL shall, and shall ensure
that its representatives will, conduct all Remedial Action in a manner that
(a) is in accordance with the professional standards practiced by reputable
professions in environmental consulting or other applicable professions; (b)
takes all reasonable steps to protect from damage all existing improvements on
the Real Property; and (c) takes all reasonable steps to prevent interference
with the use of the Real Property, the operation of the JRH Business on the
Real Property, and the regulatory compliance of the JRH Business. If CSL
requires access to any Real Property to conduct a Remedial Action, CSL and
Buyer will renegotiate and enter into a mutually agreeable access agreement to
provide CSL such access to the Real Property. CSL shall, and shall ensure that
its representatives will, use reasonable efforts to preserve the Real
Property in the condition in which it existed prior to commencement of the
work. Further where CSL assumes the role of Lead Party, Buyer shall cause the
Companies to assign to CSL and enable CSL to assert and prosecute in the name
and on behalf of the Companies any claims, cross claims or other rights any of
the Companies may have against third parties who have or may have any
liability for the violation of Environmental Laws or Releases of
Hazardous Substances regarding which CSL is indemnifying Buyer hereunder. If
CSL is the Lead Party or if Buyer is the Lead Party but Sellers indemnify
Buyer with respect to Losses connected with such matter, then 90% of any
recovery obtained from any third party with respect to such matter, whether
pursuant to any claim, cross claim or other right, shall redound to the
benefit of CSL, and 10% of such recovery shall redound to the benefit of
Buyer.



(iv) If, after the Closing Date, Buyer or any Company is required to sign
and/or certify any document required by an Environmental Law or a Governmental
Entity to achieve compliance with any Environmental Law or to effect a
Remedial Action, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies, to consult with
CSL with respect to the form and content of such document; provided, that
Buyer shall have sole discretion as to the final form and content of such
document. In no event shall Buyers or any Companys signing and/or
certifying, or failure to or delay in signing and/or certifying, to any such
document extend the duration of CSLs indemnification obligations hereunder.
Buyer shall provide a final copy of all such documents to CSL.



(d) Each Sellers obligations to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
any Environmental Loss shall be deemed satisfied (i) so long as the remedy
complies with applicable Environmental Laws as applied to the real property in
question based upon its use at the time of the Closing Date and (ii) upon
receipt of a no further action letter or its equivalent from the appropriate
Governmental Entity or written acknowledgment from the Governmental Entity
that the work is complete, if such Governmental Entity has taken jurisdiction
over the matter.



8.7 _Survival_. All representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement shall survive until the second anniversary of the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 shall survive until the tenth anniversary of
the Closing Date, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.19 shall survive 90 days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations period applicable thereto (including  



 

74  any extension and tolling), and (iii) representations and warranties set
forth in Sections 3.20 and 3.35 shall survive until the fifth anniversary of
the Closing Date, except that the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.20 with respect to the Real Property and JRH Business operations at
the Swampbridge Road Facility shall survive until the sixth anniversary of the
Closing Date. CSL shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to
the matters disclosed in Section 3.20 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (other
than the matters at the Swampbridge Road Facility) with respect to claims made
therefor after the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date; and CSL shall have
no obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to the matters at the
Swampbridge Road Facility disclosed in Section 3.20 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule with respect to claims made therefor after the sixth anniversary of
the Closing Date. All of the covenants, agreements and obligations of the
parties contained in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing Date
shall, unless a different period is expressly provided for herein,
survive until fully performed or fulfilled, unless non-compliance with such
covenants, agreements or obligations is waived in writing by the party or
parties entitled to such performance.



8.8 _Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge_. The right to
indemnification, payment of damages or any other remedy based on
representations, warranties, covenants or any other obligations under this
Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to
such matters by Buyer nor any knowledge acquired by it (or capable of being
acquired by it) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date.



8.9 _Coordination With Tax Covenant_. In the event any provision of this
Article VIII with respect to Tax matters is inconsistent with any provision
of Article IX, the provisions of Article IX shall control.



ARTICLE IX



TAX INDEMNIFICATION 



9.1 _CSL Tax Indemnity_. From and after the Closing Date and subject to the
provisions of this Article IX, CSL agrees to indemnify Buyer against the
following:



(a) all Taxes or liabilities for Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Companies for any taxable period or portion thereof that ends on or before
the Closing Date;



(b) all Taxes or liabilities for Taxes of any Person (other than the
Companies) imposed on any of the Companies as a transferee or successor, by
contract or pursuant to Law, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring before the Closing;



(c) all Taxes or liabilities for Taxes arising by reason of any of
the Restructuring Transactions, the Debt Releases, the Retained Earnings
Dividend and transactions contemplated by Section 5.7 of this Agreement;



(d) all Taxes or liabilities for Taxes arising pursuant to the provisions of
s179 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 as a result of the transfer of
the shares in JRH/UK; and



(e) all Losses relating to any Taxes or liabilities for Taxes in Sections
9.1(a) through 9.1(d).  



 

75  Except for the representations set forth in Section 3.19 and the
indemnification therefore provided in Article VIII, this Article IX is the
sole provision governing Tax matters and indemnities therefor under this
Agreement. The provisions of Section 9.6(e) shall apply to any indemnification
for breach of a representation set forth in Section 3.19 in lieu of the
provisions of Section 8.5.

 



9.2 _Excluded Tax Liabilities_. CSL shall not be liable to indemnify Buyer
for Taxes or any liabilities for Taxes under this Article IX, or under Article
VIII pursuant to a breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section
3.19, if and to the extent:



(a) such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes are attributable to any
business operations or transactions of Buyer or its Affiliates, including the
Companies, after the Closing, except to the extent governed by Section 9.5;



(b) such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes are reflected on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet (excluding any deferred Tax items) and included in the
calculation of the Closing Net Cash;



(c) such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes arise in a taxable period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date as a result of a reduction in or
elimination of a Tax loss carryforward of the Companies from a period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date to a period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date;



(d) Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies), receive payment
for such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes as a result of any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment from any third party with respect
thereto; it being understood that Buyer, its Affiliates or the Companies
shall be obligated to assert a right of indemnification or contribution from a
third party only to the extent of their actual knowledge of such right without
independent investigation thereof and such assertion would not be unduly
burdensome;



(e) such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes arise as a direct result of a change
in legislation that is announced and enacted after the Closing Date but has an
effective date on or prior to the Closing Date (for purposes of this Section
9.2(e), the item disclosed on Section 3.7(1) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule shall be deemed announced);



(f) solely with respect to JRH/UK, any relief arising in respect of any event
occurring or any income, profits or gains earned, accrued or received on or
before the Closing Date (other than a relief which has previously been
utilized and other than a relief which was taken into account in the
calculation of Closing Net Cash) is available or is for no consideration and
at no cost (including any Tax cost) to the Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Companies, made available to relieve or mitigate the Taxes or
liability for Taxes in respect of which CSL or any of the Sellers is liable
under this Agreement and so that, for this purpose any relief arising in
respect of a taxable period that begins on or before the Closing Date and
ends after the Closing Date shall be apportioned on a time basis, unless some
other basis is more reasonable having regard, inter alia, to the principles
set out in Section 9.5;



(g) solely with respect to JRH/UK, such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes
arise or are increased wholly or mainly in consequence of any failure by
Buyer or its Affiliates to comply with this Agreement;



 

76 (h) solely with respect to JRH/UK, such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes would
not have arisen but for any claim, election, surrender or disclaimer made, or
notice or consent given, or any other thing done, after the Closing Date
(other than one the making, giving or doing of which was specifically taken
into account in the calculation of Closing Net Cash) under, or in connection
with, the provisions of any enactment or regulation relating to Tax by the
Buyer or any of its Affiliates and otherwise than at the direction of CSL;



(i) solely with respect to JRH/UK, such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes would
not have arisen but for the failure or omission by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, otherwise than at the direction of CSL, to make any claim,
election, surrender or disclaimer, or give any notice, or consent or do any
other thing, under, or in connection with, the provisions of any enactment
or regulation relating to Tax after the Closing Date (collectively, the "
_Tax Claims_ "), the anticipated making, giving or doing of which was
specifically taken into account in the calculation of Closing Net Cash;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , the details of all Tax Claims, the anticipated
making, giving or doing of which have been or are to be taken into account in
the calculation of Closing Net Cash have been either set forth on Section 3.19
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or provided to Buyer by written notice no
later than 60 days following the Closing Date; provided, further, CSL shall
notify Buyer in writing of the details of all Tax Claims, the anticipated
making, giving or doing of which have been or are to be taken into account in
the calculation of Closing Net Cash, within a reasonable time before any such
Tax Claims are to be made, gave or done in order for Buyer to properly
evaluate such Tax Claims and make, give or do such Tax Claims; or 



(j) such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes arise in connection with any entity
classification election made for JRH/UK or JRH/Australia pursuant to Section
5.8.



9.3 _Buyer Tax Indemnity_. Buyer and its Affiliates, including the Companies
following the Closing Date, shall indemnify and hold harmless CSL and its
Affiliates for and against all Taxes attributable to any business operations
or transaction of Buyer or its Affiliates, including the Companies after
Closing, imposed on any of CSL and its Affiliates for a taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (calculated in accordance
with Section 9.5).



9.4 _Due Dates_. Indemnification payments by any Indemnifying Party for any
Taxes under this Article IX shall be made within ten Business Days following
written notice by the Indemnified Party;  _provided_ that no Indemnifying
Party shall be required to make any payment earlier than two Business Days
before such Taxes are due and payable to a Taxing Authority. In case of any
Contest under Section 9.6(e) of this Agreement, payment of such Tax to the
Taxing Authority shall be considered due no earlier than five Business Days
following the date a final determination is made by the Tax Authority or a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Tax is due and payable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any immediate payment of any
asserted Taxes or liabilities for Taxes is required by Law to be paid prior to
the right to contest such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes, the Indemnifying
Party shall pay such disputed Taxes or liabilities for Taxes within the
requisite period of time required by Law and the Indemnifying Party shall
retain the right to contest such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes
notwithstanding that such Taxes or liabilities for Taxes have been paid. In
such case, the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
in the manner set forth in Section 9.6.



9.5 _Proration of Certain Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, in case of
any Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that begins
before the Closing Date and ends  



 

77  after the Closing Date, the portion of any such Taxes that are allocable to
the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date shall be: (i) deemed
equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year ended on the
Closing Date in the case of Taxes that are either _(x)_ Taxes on income or
_(y)_ imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer of property (real
or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this
Agreement) and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, deemed to equal the amount
of such Taxes for the entire period multiplied by a fraction in which the
numerator is the number of days in the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator is the number of days in the entire period.



9.6 _Tax Cooperation_. Each of CSL, Buyer and their respective Affiliates
shall cooperate as set forth below with respect to Tax matters for time
periods ending on or before the Closing Date.



(a) _Tax Cooperation in General_. Each of Buyer and its Affiliates and CSL
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes.



(b) _Information_. In addition to such other information as may be required
to be provided by Buyer under this Agreement, Buyer shall provide to CSL such
information (including copies of relevant documents and work papers) as CSL
may reasonably request in order for CSL to comply with its Tax obligations,
including reporting requirements, filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or
claim for refund, or participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes.



(c) _Preparation of Tax Returns_. CSL shall have the exclusive right
to prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) or control the
preparation and filing of all Tax Returns relating to the Companies that are
due on or before the Closing Date or that relate to any taxable period ending
on or before the Closing Date. With respect to any Tax Return so prepared by
CSL after the Closing Date, CSL shall provide Buyer with a copy of such
completed return, and a statement at least 30 calendar days prior to the due
date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such return, and
Buyer shall have the right to review such return and statement prior to the
filing of such return. Buyer and CSL agree to consult and to attempt in good
faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such return
and statement; _provided_ that any objection that is not resolved by Buyer and
CSL shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm of international
reputation acceptable to CSL and Buyer for resolution, whose determination
shall be binding on Buyer and CSL (and any expenses shall be borne as
provided in Section 9.6(f)). Buyer and CSL shall have joint control over the
preparation and filing of any Tax Returns relating to a taxable period for
which Taxes are prorated under Section 9.5. Buyer and CSL agree to consult
and to attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the
preparation and filing of such returns and statements; _provided_ that any
objection that is not resolved by Buyer and CSL shall be submitted to an
independent accounting firm of international reputation acceptable to CSL and
Buyer for resolution, whose determination shall be binding on Buyer and CSL
(and any expenses shall be borne as provided in Section 9.6(f)). All such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in
prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns except for changes required by
applicable Law.



(d) _Retention of Books and Records_. Each of Buyer and CSL shall retain all
returns, schedules, and work-papers and all material records or other
documents relating to Tax  



 

78  matters of the Companies for the taxable periods referenced in this Article
IX until four years following the expiration of the applicable statute
of limitations (and, to the extent notified by such other party, any
extensions thereof), shall give the other party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, at such time, if such other party so requests, shall allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records.



(e) _Contest_. CSL may elect to direct, through counsel of its own choice and
at its own expense, any audit, claim for refund and administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability with respect to which
indemnity may be sought against CSL under this Article IX (any such audit,
claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax Liability is
referred to herein as a " _Contest_ "); _provided_ that CSL informs Buyer of
the progress and substantive aspects of any such Contest, including providing
Buyer with all written materials relating to the Contest received from the
relevant Taxing Authorities. If CSL elects to direct a Contest, then CSL
shall, within forty-five calendar days of receipt of Buyers notice of
asserted Tax liability, notify Buyer of its intent to do so, and Buyer shall
cooperate and shall cause each of the Companies to cooperate, in each phase of
such Contest. If CSL does not elect to direct the Contest or fails to notify
Buyer of its election to direct the Contest as herein provided, Buyer may pay,
compromise or contest such asserted Tax liability in accordance with prudent
business standards, as if no indemnification were granted hereunder;
_provided_ that Buyer may not settle or compromise such asserted Tax liability
without the prior written consent of CSL (which consent to settlement or
compromise shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Buyer
shall inform CSL of the progress and the substantive aspects of any Contest
Buyer directs, including providing CSL with all written materials relating to
the Contest received from relevant Taxing Authorities. In any event, CSL may
participate, at its own expense, in any Contest controlled by Buyer. If CSL
chooses to direct the Contest as provided above, Buyer shall promptly empower
and shall cause its Affiliates promptly to empower (by power of attorney and
such other documentation as may be necessary and appropriate) the designated
representatives of CSL to represent Buyer in the Contest insofar as the
Contest involves an asserted Tax liability with respect to which indemnity may
be sought against CSL under this Article IX; _provided_ , _however_ , Buyer
shall be entitled to participate in any such Contest and CSL shall not agree
to any settlement or compromise without Buyers consent if in the Buyers
discretion such settlement or compromise reasonably may have an adverse
impact on the Tax liability of any of the Companies, Buyer or its Affiliates
in a period beginning after the Closing Date; _provided_ _further_ Buyer and
CSL shall jointly control Contests with respect to any taxable period for
which Taxes would be prorated under Section 9.5 and neither CSL nor Buyer
shall agree to any settlement of any Contest without the other Partys consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).



(f) _Cooperation Costs_. Each of Buyer and CSL agree that any expenses
incurred by a party or its Affiliates in connection with the cooperation
described in this Section 9.6 shall be the responsibility of such party and
its Affiliates incurring the cost and no reimbursement shall be sought
from the party requesting such cooperation.



(g) _Transfer Taxes_. (i) All sales, use, transfer, documentary, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes that are payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by the party
responsible therefor under applicable Law. The party required by applicable
Law to file any Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any such
Taxes shall prepare and file such Tax Returns and the Buyer and Sellers shall
each, and shall each cause its Affiliates to, cooperate in the timely
preparation and filing of, and join in the execution of, any such Tax Returns
and other documentation.



 

79 (ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
be responsible for and shall pay any stamp duty or similar tax payable in
respect of the transfer of the Capital Securities of JRH/UK and JRH/Australia
pursuant to this Agreement.



9.7 _Survival_. The right to indemnification under this Article IX shall
expire 90 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extensions or tolling thereof).



9.8 _Refunds_. Except to the extent taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price or subject to Section 9.2(d) of this Agreement, CSL shall be
entitled to all refunds of Taxes, plus any interest thereon received from a
Taxing Authority, with respect to the Companies relating to taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall, upon
receipt of any refund by Buyer or the Companies, pay over to CSL any such
refund or the amount of any such benefit within five Business Days of the
receipt thereof. Buyer shall, if CSL so requests, cause the Companies to file
for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to which CSL is entitled to
under this Section 9.8 except to the extent that in the Buyers discretion
such claim for refund reasonably may have an adverse impact on the Tax
liability of any of the Companies, Buyer or its Affiliates in a period
beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer shall permit CSL to control (at CSLs
expense) the prosecution of any such refund claimed, and shall cause the
relevant Company to authorize by appropriate power of attorney such persons as
CSL shall designate to represent such entity with respect to such refund
claimed.



9.9 _Tax Covenants_.



(a) Except as required by Law, neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall
amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Companies to amend,
refile or otherwise modify, any accounting method, election or Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Companies with respect to any taxable
year or period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date
without the prior written consent of CSL (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such amendment, refilling or
modification would reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the
Tax liability of any of the Companies in a period ending on or before the
Closing Date.



(b) To the extent permitted by Law, neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer
shall carry back, or cause or permit the Companies to carry back,
for federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax purposes to any taxable year or
period, or portion thereof, ending on or before the Closing Date any operating
losses, net operating losses, capital losses, Tax credits or similar items
arising in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date without a prior
written consent of CSL (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) if carrying back such item would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on the Tax liability of any of the
Companies in a period ending on or before the Closing Date.



(c) As of the Closing Date, the Companies shall be released from all tax-
sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving the
Companies, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Companies) shall have
no further liability with respect thereunder.



 

80 (d) Buyer will procure that JRH/UK continues to qualify as a trading company
within the meaning of Schedule 7AC to the Taxation and Chargeable Gains Act
1992 for a period of 30 days following the Closing Date.



(e) Buyer shall, at the direction in writing of CSL/UK, procure that JRH/UK
accepts and takes all action necessary for any surrender of group
relief pursuant to section 402 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988
from CSL/UK (of any of its Affiliates) to JRH/UK where such surrender would
operate to reduce or eliminate a liability for Taxes of JRH/UK for which any
Seller is liable under this Agreement (and where such surrender is permitted
by law).



ARTICLE X



OTHER PROVISIONS

 



10.1 _Amendment and Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended
or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by Sellers and Buyer, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or
delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or privilege.



10.2 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, the parties hereto shall bear their own respective expenses
(including, but not limited to, all compensation and expenses of counsel,
financial advisors, consultants, actuaries and independent accountants)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.



10.3 _Binding Agreement: Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party to this Agreement may assign
this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement
without the express prior written consent of the other party hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall have the right to transfer and
assign the rights hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates so long as Buyer
remains obligated with respect hereto and such assignment in no way delays
the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Buyer in any event shall have the right to transfer and
assign the right to acquire the shares of JRH/Australia to an Affiliate formed
under the laws of Australia so long as the additional filings as identified
in Section 6.1(a)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are made in accordance
with, and within the time periods specified in, the procedures set forth in
Section 5.3. Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.



10.4  _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including all Exhibits and
Schedules hereto) and any agreement between Buyer and Sellers making specific
reference to this Section 10.4 contain the entire agreement between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with respect to such
matters, except for the Confidentiality Agreement which will remain in full
force and effect for the term provided for therein. 



 

81 10.5 _Remedies_. Except in the case of fraud (as to which there shall be no
limit on the remedies available to or recoverable by Buyer or Sellers on
account thereof) and with respect to covenants contained in Article II and
Article V (which, if breached, the parties agree would result in irreparable
injury for which the non-breaching party would not have an adequate remedy at
law and would therefore be entitled to injunctive relief), the sole and
exclusive remedy of Buyer and Sellers after the Closing with respect to any
Losses relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
Article VIII, Article IX and Schedule C. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Buyer and Sellers hereby waive, from and after the Closing, any and
all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims or causes of
action based on fraud or with respect to covenants contained in Article II and
Section 5.2) any of them may have against any other party hereto, or any of
the parties respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees or equity
owners, arising under or based upon any Law or arising under or based upon
common law or otherwise (except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in Article VIII, Article IX and Schedule C).



10.6 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section 5.13,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Person other than Buyer, Sellers, or their respective successors or permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.



10.7 _Schedules_. The inclusion of any matter in any specific Section or
Subsection of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule
(including all schedules and exhibits thereto) shall not be deemed to be
disclosed for any other Section or Subsection of such Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule unless included or referenced in such
other Section or Subsection. Inclusion in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or
Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an
admission by Buyer, Sellers, or the Companies, or otherwise imply, that any
such matter is material or creates a measure for materiality for the purposes
of this Agreement.



10.8 _Conversion of Amounts into U.S. Dollars_. Whenever used in this
Agreement, "$" or "Dollars" refers to U.S. Dollars unless the text expressly
indicates otherwise. To the extent that any amount payable in U.S. Dollars
under this Agreement is based on an amount denominated in a currency other
than U.S. Dollars, that amount shall be converted into U.S. Dollars using the
U.S. Dollar exchange rate for such currency as published in the United States
edition of _The Wall Street Journal_ on the Business Day immediately preceding
the date on which such amount is payable. Any amount referenced herein in a
currency other than U.S. Dollars shall be deemed a reference to the amounts of
U.S. Dollars into which such amount of currency is convertible using the U.S.
Dollar exchange rate for such currency as published in the U.S. edition of
the United States edition of The Wall Street Journal on the Business Day
immediately preceding the date as of which such amount is to be measured in
accordance with this Agreement.



10.9 _GST Issues_.



(a) Unless otherwise expressly stated, all amounts payable under
this Agreement are expressed to be exclusive of GST. If GST is payable on a
Taxable Supply, the amount payable for that Taxable Supply will be the amount
expressed in this Agreement plus GST.



 

82 (b) Without limiting paragraph (a) above, if an amount payable under this
Agreement is calculated by reference to a Loss incurred by a party, then the
Loss must be reduced by the amount of any Input Tax Credit to which that party
is entitled in respect of that Loss. A party will be assumed to be entitled to
a full Input Credit unless it demonstrates that its entitlement is otherwise
prior to the date on which payment must be made.



(c) A party receiving a Taxable Supply (the " _Recipient_ ") is not required
to pay an amount on account of GST under paragraph (a) above to the party
making the Taxable Supply (the " _Supplier_ ") until the Supplier has provided
the Recipient with a Tax Invoice in respect of that Taxable Supply.



(d) In this Section 10.9, the terms "GST", "Input Tax Credit", "Loss", "Tax
Invoice" and "Taxable Supply" have the meaning given in section 195-1 of the
(Australia) A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth).



10.10 _Interpretation; Headings; Etc_. The table of contents and headings
herein are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and do not limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to an Article, Section, Schedule
or Exhibit, such reference is to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." All words used in this
Agreement shall be construed to be of such number and gender as the context
requires or permits.

10.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
