number of days of such Tax period occurring during the Post Closing Tax

Section 2.05 _Transfer of Shares_.  On the Closing Date and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Stock Sellers will
sell, convey, assign and transfer to the Stock Buyers, and the Stock Buyers
will purchase and acquire, all of such Stock Sellers right, title and
interest in and to the Sold Shares, free and clear of all Liens and those
Liens that may be created by or on behalf of the Buyers.

  



  

Section 2.06 _Assignment of Purchased Assets and Rights_. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not
constitute an agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any claim or right
or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if an attempted
assignment thereof, without consent of a third party thereto, would
constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely
affect the rights of an Asset Buyer or Asset Seller thereunder. If any
transfer or assignment by any Asset Seller to, or any assumption by any Asset
Buyer of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any
asset requires the consent of a third party, then such assignment or
assumption shall be made subject to such consent being obtained. ** _
_**Sellers and Buyers will use their commercially reasonable efforts (but
without any payment of money by Sellers or Buyers) to obtain the consent of
the other parties to any such Purchased Asset or claim or right or any
benefit arising

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

thereunder for the assignment thereof to an Asset Buyer as Buyers may
request. If such consent is not obtained, Sellers and Buyers will cooperate
in any mutually agreeable arrangement under which the Asset Buyers shall
obtain the economic claims, rights and benefits of the asset with respect to
which the consent has not been obtained in accordance with this Agreement.
Such reasonable arrangement may include subcontracting, sub-licensing, or
subleasing to Buyers, or under which Sellers would, to the extent
commercially practicable, enforce for the benefit of Buyers, any and all
rights of Sellers against a third party thereto. Sellers will promptly pay
to Buyer Parent all monies received by Sellers after the Closing constituting
a Purchased Asset (or the proceeds thereof) or under any Purchased Asset or
any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder that accrues after
the Closing, except to the extent the same represents an Excluded Asset. To
the extent any Acquired Contract may not be assigned to an Asset Buyer by
reason of the absence of any such consent and provided only to the extent no
portion of the economic claims, rights or benefits under such asset are
received by the Asset Buyers, no Buyer shall assume any Assumed Liabilities
arising under such Acquired Contract, other than such as arise from Buyers
failure to comply with the terms of such Acquired Contract except with
respect to a failure by a Buyer to obtain the consent to the assignment to
such Buyer of such Acquired Contract by a Seller.

  



  

Section 2.07 _Apportionment of Certain Expenses_. Sellers and Buyers
acknowledge that certain expenses of the Business are paid on a periodic
basis. Accordingly, the items listed below, to the extent not included in the
Closing Balance Sheet (other than Excluded Liabilities), shall be apportioned
between Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyers, on the other, with Sellers
being responsible for all such expenses attributable to periods on or prior
to the Closing Date, and Buyers being responsible for all expenses
attributable to periods from and after the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) prepaid rent, tenant utility payments and all other percentage or
additional rent, common area maintenance and sundry charges (including any
HVAC charges) and commissions paid by tenants;

  



  

(b) utility company charges, including electricity, gas, fuel, water and
sewer charges; and

  



  

(c) installments of general and special assessments and other public or
private charges affecting the Leased Real Property.

  



  

The parties agree to apportion certain reimbursement obligations as specified
on _Schedule 2.07_.

  



  

Section 2.08 _Consideration_.  On the Closing Date and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, in reliance on the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of the parties
contained herein and in consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer of
the Purchased Assets, the Buyers will pay to Sellers, or, to the extent
required in accordance with Section 2.14(a)(iv), to the escrow agent referred
to in Section 2.14, three hundred ninety million dollars ($390,000,000.00)
(the " _Closing Payment_ "). The term " _Purchase Price_ " shall mean the
Closing Payment as adjusted, if at all, pursuant to Section 2.12.

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

Section 2.09 _License Agreement_.  At the Closing, Buyer Parent and Seller
Parent shall enter into the License Agreement, pursuant to which Seller
Parent will license or sublicense to Buyers a portion of the
Licensed Intellectual Property.

  



  

Section 2.10 _The Closing_.  Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Article XI, subject to Article IX, the closing (the " _Closing_
") of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at the
offices of Choate, Hall and Stewart LLP in Boston, Massachusetts as soon
as possible, but in no event later than three Business Days after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Article IX
hereof or at such other place and time as may be agreed upon by Seller Parent
and Buyer Parent (the date upon which the Closing occurs referred to as the "
_Closing Date_ "). Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall agree in writing as
to the time of the Closing.

(a) At or prior to the Closing, the Asset Sellers shall deliver or cause to

17   

     
   

  



  

Section 2.12 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _General_. As an adjustment to the Purchase Price, Seller Parent agrees
to pay Buyer Parent the amount, if any, by which Reference Net Asset Value
exceeds the Closing Net Asset Value, and Buyer Parent agrees to pay Seller
Parent the amount, if any, by which Closing Net Asset Value exceeds the
Reference Net Asset Value. In addition, recognizing that royalty payments and
earn-out payments are reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Reference Balance Sheet on a cash basis, to the extent that royalty payments
and earn-out payments are received pre and post-Closing by Buyer or Seller,
the payments will be evaluated on the accrual basis of accounting and such
payments that relate to pre-Closing periods will be paid to Seller Parent and
any such payments received that relate to post-Closing periods will be
paid to Buyer Parent.

  



  

(b) _Definitions_.  The following terms, as used herein, have the following
meanings:

  



  

" _Closing Balance Sheet_ " means a balance sheet for the Business, excluding
Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities, as of the close of business on the
day immediately preceding the Closing Date that presents fairly, in all
material respects, the financial condition of the Business as of such date,
and which is prepared from the books and records of the Sellers and in
accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise stated therein and except for the
omission of footnotes) on a basis consistent with the Reference Balance
Sheet.

  



  

" _Closing Net Asset Value_ " means that dollar amount as is equal to the
dollar amount of the total assets of the Business (other than Excluded
Assets) plus any cash amounts included in the Purchased Assets in excess of
those amounts specified on _Schedule 2.12(b)(i)_, as reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet, _less _ the dollar amount of the total liabilities of
the Business (other than Excluded Liabilities), as reflected on the Closing
Balance Sheet _._ The Closing Net Asset Value shall be calculated in
accordance with _Schedule 2.12(b)(ii)_.

  



  

" _Reference Net Asset Value_ " means $208,337,000, such amount being equal
to the dollar amount of the total assets of the Business (other than Excluded
Assets), as reflected on the Reference Balance Sheet, _less_ the
dollar amount of the total liabilities of the Business (other than
Excluded Liabilities), as reflected on the Reference Balance Sheet.

  



  

(c) _Preparation of Closing Balance Sheet_. As promptly as practicable after
the Closing Date, Buyer Parent will, at its sole expense, cause to be
prepared the Closing Balance Sheet by its independent public accountants and
its calculation of Closing Net Asset Value. As promptly as practicable, but
no later than sixty (60) days, after the Closing Date, Buyer Parent will
cause the Closing Balance Sheet to be delivered to Seller Parent.

  



  

(d) _Disagreement by Seller_. If Seller Parent disagrees with Buyer
Parents calculation of Closing Net Asset Value, Seller Parent may, within
twenty (20) days after receipt of the documents referred to in Section
2.12(c), deliver a notice to Buyer Parent disagreeing with such calculation
and setting forth Seller Parents calculation of the Closing Balance Sheet
and Closing Net Asset Value. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify
those items or amounts

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

as to which Seller Parent disagrees and Seller Parent shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Balance
Sheet.

  



  

(e) _Dispute Resolution_.  If a notice of disagreement shall have been
delivered by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 2.12(d), the parties shall,
during the twenty (20) days following said delivery, use their best efforts
to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the
Closing Net Asset Value. If, during such period, the parties are unable to
reach agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause the Accounting Referee
promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating Closing Net Asset Value. In making such calculation,
the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet as to which Seller Parent has disagreed. ** **The
Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, as
promptly as practicable, a report setting forth such calculation.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties hereto. The cost of
such review and report shall be borne (i) by Buyer Parent if Seller Parents
calculation of Closing Net Asset Value is closer to the final calculation of
Closing Net Asset Value determined by the Accounting Referee than Buyer
Parents calculation thereof, (ii) by Seller Parent if the reverse is true
and (iii) otherwise equally by Buyer Parent and Seller Parent.

  



  

(f) _Cooperation_.  The parties hereto agree that they will, and agree to
cause their respective independent accountants to, cooperate and assist in
the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Net Asset Value and in the conduct of the audits and reviews referred to in
this Section 2.12, including without limitation the making available to the
extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

  



  

(g) _Time of Payment_.  Any payment pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be
made at a mutually convenient time and place (i) within thirty (30) days
after delivery by Buyer Parent of the documents referred to in Section
2.12(c) if no notice of disagreement with respect to Closing Net Asset Value
is delivered by Seller Parent within the twenty (20) day period described
above in Section 2.01(d) or (ii) if a notice of disagreement with respect to
Closing Net Asset Value is so delivered then within ten (10) days after the
earlier of (A) agreement between the parties pursuant to Section 2.12(e) with
respect to Closing Net Asset Value and (B) delivery of the calculation of
Closing Net Asset Value by the Accounting Referee pursuant to Section
2.12(e).

  



  

(h) _Method of Payment_.  Any payments pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be
made by delivery by Seller Parent, or Buyer Parent, as the case may be, of a
certified or official bank check payable in funds to Buyer Parent or Seller
Parent, as the case may be, or by causing such payments to be credited to
such account of Seller Parent or Buyer Parent as may be designated by Seller
Parent or Buyer Parent. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to
this Section 2.12 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to
but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the rate
publicly announced from time to time by Citibank N.A. **** as its base or
prime rate in New York City in effect from time to time during the period
from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be payable
at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be calculated
daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of days for
which due.

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

Section 2.13 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

  



  

(a) _Schedule 2.13_ sets forth the agreed allocation of the Closing Payment
(plus the book value of the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets
(the " _Allocation Statement_ "). The parties shall update the
Allocation Statement as of the Closing to reflect the Purchase Price (plus
the book value of the Assumed Liabilities) of the Purchased Assets as of the
Closing Date. In the event an adjustment to the Purchase Price is made
pursuant to Section 2.12, the allocation of the Purchase Price (including the
book value of the Assumed Liabilities) shall be revised accordingly by Buyer
Parent and proposed by Buyer Parent to Seller Parent for approval (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

  



  

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, each Seller and Buyer
agree to report the Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a manner entirely consistent with the Allocation Statement, as
updated as at the Closing, and agree to act in accordance with such
Allocation Statement, and not to take any position inconsistent therewith, in
the preparation of financial statements and filing of all Tax Returns
(including filing Form 8594 with its Federal income tax return for the
taxable year that includes the date of the Closing), as well as in preparing
any published financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and also in the
course of any Tax audit, Tax review or Tax litigation or other investigation
relating thereto.

  



  

(c) No later than 10 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594
relating to this transaction, each party shall deliver to the other party a
copy of its Form 8594.

  



  

Section 2.14 _Deferred Purchase_.

  



  

(a) China.

  



  

(i) The purchase and sale of the China Purchased Assets and the transfer and
assumption of the China Assumed Liabilities (the " _China Transfer_ ") shall
be effected pursuant to a separate purchase and sale agreement, the form of
which is attached as _Exhibit H_ (the " _China Purchase Agreement_ "),
provided that the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the China Transfer
and prevail in the event of any inconsistency.

  



  

(ii) The parties shall cause the China Transfer to occur at the Closing,
except as specified in this Section 2.14(a).

  



  

(iii) To facilitate satisfaction of the conditions precedent in Section 3 of
the China Purchase Agreement, Buyer Parent or its Affiliate may contribute
registered capital into the designated Asset Buyer prior to the Closing.

  



  

(iv) If the conditions precedent specified in Section 3 of the China Purchase
Agreement are not satisfied on or prior to the Closing, then, unless mutually
agreed in writing otherwise by Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, provided that
the purchase and sale of all other Purchased Assets has occurred, including
the Malaysia Transfer, (A) the China Transfer shall be delayed and not occur
at the Closing but shall instead occur within five (5) PRC Business Days of
the conditions precedent specified in Section 3 to

  



  

20   

     
   

  



  

the China Purchase Agreement having been satisfied or waived in writing by
Buyer Parent (the " _China Transfer Date_ ") and the parties shall cause the
China Transfer Date to be the closing date established pursuant to the China
Purchase Agreement; (B) the portion of the Purchase Price allocable to the
China Purchased Assets and the China Assumed Liabilities, as such amount is
agreed upon in writing by Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, shall be remitted
by Buyer Parent to an escrow agent mutually agreed to in writing by Buyer
Parent and Seller Parent, such escrowed funds to be released either (1) to
the appropriate Asset Buyer on a date on or prior to the anticipated China
Transfer Date that is mutually agreed by the parties as necessary to satisfy
applicable regulatory requirements, such funds to be held by such Asset Buyer
pending remittance to the designated Asset Seller on the China Transfer Date,
or (2) to Buyer Parent on the first Business Day subsequent to the China
Transfer Date if such escrowed funds were not necessary to effect the China
Transfer because Buyer Parent or its Affiliates have contributed sufficient
registered capital into the designated Asset Buyer prior to the Closing Date
in accordance with Section 2.14(a)(iii) such that Asset Buyer had sufficient
funds to remit to Asset Seller in satisfaction of the purchase price pursuant
to the China Purchase Agreement and that such funds were remitted by the
Asset Buyer and received by the Asset Seller pursuant to the China Purchase
Agreement, or (3) to Seller Parent should the China Transfer not occur within
six (6) months from the Closing Date; (C) Articles VI, VII and VIII and
Sections 5.01, 5.02 and 5.03 shall continue to apply for the period from the
Closing Date to the China Transfer Date, _mutatis mutandis_ ; and (D) Buyers
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions
precedent specified in Section 3 of the China Purchase Agreement to be
satisfied.

  



  

(v) If, subsequent to six (6) months from the Closing Date the China Transfer
Date shall not have occurred, Buyer Parent shall be responsible for accepting
possession of the China Purchased Assets and assuming the China Assumed
Liabilities as permitted by applicable Law. The failure of the China
Transfer to occur at the Closing as provided in this Section 2.14(a) shall
not affect Buyers obligation to consummate the Closing, other than with
respect to the China Purchased Assets and the China Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

(vi) For purposes of clarity, except as provided in this Section 2.14(a), the
China Transfer shall be conditioned solely on the prior occurrence of the
Closing and on the China Purchased Assets being conveyed to the designated
Buyer free of any Liens other than Permitted Liens, and on the Shanghai
Sublease being executed and delivered by the parties thereto. At or prior to
the China Transfer Date, Sellers and Buyers shall deliver to each other such
instruments and documents, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyers and Sellers, as may be reasonably necessary to effect the China
Transfer (collectively, " _Chinese Transfer Documents_ "). During the period,
if any, from the Closing to the China Transfer Date, the operation of the
China Purchased Assets and the China Assumed Liabilities shall be managed by
Buyers in compliance with applicable Law and subject to the mutual
satisfaction of Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, it being understood that, to
the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyers shall have the
economic interest in and enjoy all the benefits of and be responsible for all
the liabilities of the China Purchased Assets and China Assumed Liabilities
during such period even though Sellers retain title to such assets and
liabilities.

(b) _Malaysia_. The purchase and sale of the shares of Teradyne Connection
Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (the " _Malaysia Transfer_ ") shall be effected
pursuant to a separate purchase and sale agreement, the form of which is
attached as _Exhibit I_ (the " _Malaysia Purchase Agreement_ "), provided
that the terms of this Agreement shall apply to the Malaysia Transfer and
prevail in the event of any inconsistency. The parties shall cause the
Malaysia Transfer to occur at the Closing, except as specified in this Section
2.14(b). If the Malaysia Permits are not able to be transferred to the Buyer
on the Closing, then, provided that the purchase and sale of all other
Purchased Assets has occurred, including the China Transfer, (i) the Malaysia
Transfer shall be delayed and not occur at the Closing but shall instead
occur upon Buyer Parent or an Affiliate thereof having obtained approval of
the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry for the transfer
of the shares referred to above to an Affiliate of Buyer Parent
and concurrent transfer of the Malaysia Permits (the " _Malaysia Transfer
Date_ ") and the parties shall cause the Malaysia Transfer to be the closing
date established pursuant to the Malaysia Purchase Agreement; (ii) Articles
VI, VII and VIII and Sections 5.01, 5.02 and 5.03 shall continue to apply for
the period from the Closing Date to the Malaysia Transfer Date, _mutatis
mutandis_ ; and (iii) Buyers shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the approval required under Malaysian Law for the transfer of the
Malaysia Permits.  If, subsequent to six (6) months from the Closing Date the
Malaysia Transfer Date shall not have occurred, Buyer Parent shall be
responsible for accepting possession of the shares of Teradyne Connection
Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, or, should such not be permissible in accordance
with applicable Law, Buyer Parent shall be responsible for accepting all
assets and liabilities of Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, as
permitted by applicable Law. The failure of the Malaysia Transfer to occur at
the Closing as provided in this Section 2.14(b) shall not affect Buyers
obligation to consummate the Closing, other than with respect to the shares
of Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd. For purposes of clarity,
except as provided in this Section 2.14(b), the Malaysia Transfer shall be
conditioned solely on the prior occurrence of the Closing and on the shares
being conveyed to the designated Buyer free of any Liens. At or prior to the
Malaysia Transfer Date, Sellers and Buyers shall deliver to each other such
instruments and documents, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Buyers and Sellers, as may be reasonably necessary to effect the Malaysia
Transfer (collectively, the " _Malaysian Transfer Documents_ "). During the
period, if any, from the Closing to the Malaysia Transfer Date, the operation
of Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd shall be managed by Buyers
in compliance with applicable Law and subject to the mutual satisfaction of
Buyer Parent and Seller Parent, it being understood that to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyers shall have the economic interest
in and shall enjoy all the benefits of and be responsible for all the
liabilities of Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd during such
period even though Sellers retain title to the shares of Teradyne Connection
Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd.

  



  

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustments_. In the event either the China Transfer or
the Malaysia Transfer is delayed as provided in subsections (a) or
(b), Seller Parent shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer Parent
as promptly as practicable after the Closing Date an income statement and
a balance sheet for the operations of the Business in China or of
Teradyne Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, as applicable, for the period
from January 1, 2005 to the Closing Date and as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, respectively, that present
fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and financial
condition of such business or Subsidiary, as applicable, as of such date and
which is prepared from the books and records of the Sellers and in accordance
with GAAP (except for the

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

omission of footnotes) on a basis consistent with the Interim Financial
Statements and item 2 of _Schedule 2.12(b)(ii)_ (the " _First Delayed
Transfer Financial Statements_ "). As promptly as practicable after the
China Transfer Date or Malaysia Transfer Date, as applicable, Buyer Parent
shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller Parent an income statement
and balance sheet for the operations of the Business in China or of Teradyne
Connection Systems (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, as applicable, that presents fairly,
in all material respects, the results of operations and the financial
condition of such business or Subsidiary, as applicable, for the period from
the Closing Date to the China Transfer Date or Malaysia Transfer Date and as
of the China Transfer Date or Malaysia Transfer Date, respectively, and which
is prepared from the books and records of such business or Subsidiary and in
accordance with GAAP (except for the omission of footnotes) on a
basis consistent with the Interim Financial Statements and item 2 of
_Schedule 2.12(b)(ii)_ (the " _Second Delayed Transfer Financial Statements_
"). The Second Delayed Transfer Financial Statements shall be mutually
acceptable to Buyer and Parent and Seller Parent. The Second Delayed
Transfer Financial Statements will include the current allocations of
expenses from Seller Parent, consistent with the allocations contained in the
Interim Financial Statements. As an adjustment to the Purchase Price, Seller
Parent agrees to pay Buyer Parent the amount, if any, of net income reflected
on the income statement that constitutes a Second Delayed Transfer Financial
Statement, and Buyer Parent agrees to pay Seller Parent the amount, if any,
of net loss reflected on the income statement that constitutes a Second
Delayed Transfer Financial Statement. In addition, Buyer Parent agrees to
remit to Seller Parent, and Seller Parent agrees to remit to Buyer Parent,
any monies provided by, or removed by, as applicable, Seller Parent or an
Affiliate thereof between the Closing Date and the China Transfer Date or the
Malaysia Transfer Date that result in a liability being incurred or asset
being recorded (including as a result of a distribution of equity), as
applicable, on the balance sheet that constitutes a Second Delayed Transfer
Financial Statement, together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal
to the rate publicly announced from time to time by Citibank N.A. as its base
or prime rate in New York City in effect from time to time.  Any payment
made pursuant to this Section 2.14(c) shall be made by wire transfer from the
Buyer Parent to the Seller Parent or from the Seller Parent to the Buyer
Parent, as applicable, as soon as practicable following the mutual agreement
of the Seller Parent and Buyer Parent as to the Second Delayed Transfer
Financial Statements.

warranties), Sellers hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to
Buyers as follows:

  



  

Section 3.01 _Organization_.  Each of the Sellers is a corporation or other
business entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its

material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
required to own its assets and carry on the operation of the Business as now
conducted by the Sellers, with the exception of such licenses, good standing,

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 3.02 _Subsidiaries_.  Each Sold Company is wholly-owned, directly or
indirectly, by the Sellers. Other than the shares of capital stock of the
Sold Companies owned directly or indirectly by each Stock Seller as set forth

shares of capital stock, other securities or phantom or other equity
interests of a Sold Company, (b) securities of a Sold Company convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or other securities of such
Sold Company, or (c) options or other rights to acquire from a Sold Company
any capital stock, other securities or phantom or other equity interests in
such Sold Company.  Each of the Sold Companies is a corporation or other
business entity duly incorporated or organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization,
is in good standing in the jurisdictions in which the ownership of its
property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification, and has
all corporate powers and all material governmental licenses, authorizations,
consents and approvals required to carry on the operation of the Business as
now conducted by such Sold Company, with the exception of such licenses, good
standing, authorizations, consents and approvals, the absence of which would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.02(a)_, all of
the issued and outstanding Sold Shares of each of the Sold Companies are
owned of record free and clear of any Liens (other than as such as may be
created by or on behalf of the Buyers) by the Stock Seller identified on
_Schedule 3.02(a)_ as owning such Sold Shares. All of such issued
and outstanding Sold Shares are validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and have not been issued in violation of any preemptive or
similar rights. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.02(b)_ and except for the
Sold Companies, no Subsidiary of a Seller has been engaged in the Business.

  



  

Section 3.03 _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by each Seller of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is party, and the consummation by such Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby are within such Sellers corporate powers and
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
such Seller. This Agreement constitutes, and, when executed at the Closing,
each Ancillary Agreement will constitute, a valid and binding agreement of
each Seller, enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting the
rights and remedies of creditors and to general equitable principles.

  



  

Section 3.04 _Required Consents and Approvals_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 3.04_ and except for applicable filings and approvals under the

24   

     
   

  



  

Section 3.05 _Non-Contravention_.  Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.05_,
the execution, delivery and performance by Sellers of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements do not and will not (i) contravene or conflict with
the corporate charter or bylaws or other organizational documents of any
Seller or Sold Company; (ii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a
violation of any provision of any material Law or regulation, or a violation
of any judgment, injunction, Order or decree binding upon or applicable to
the operation of the Business; or (iii) contravene or conflict with or
result in a breach of, or constitute a default by any of the Sellers or the
Sold Companies (or create an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a material default) or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration under, or result in the creation of
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of the properties of any of
the Sold Companies or on the Sold Shares or the Purchased Assets **** under,
any Material Contract (including any Real Estate Lease that constitutes a
Material Contract) to which any of the Sellers or the Sold Companies or any
of their respective properties may be bound, except in those cases under
(iii) where a contravention or conflict would not reasonably be likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

in all material respects. Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.13(b)_, there

(b) _Schedule 3.14(b)(i)_ contains a complete and accurate list of all
material licenses and other rights granted by a Seller or any Sold Company to

Business in the preceding two (2) years nor the manufacturing, use or sale
and importation of any product or service currently manufactured, sold or
used by the Business in the countries where the Sellers currently conduct
such activities, infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property or
rights therein of any third party; (ii) neither Sellers nor any Sold Company
has received written notification in the preceding two (2) years from
a third party that either a Sellers or a Sold Companys use of the
Business Intellectual Property is infringing or misappropriating any

of any time prior to, the Closing Date, or (ii) omit or agree or commit to
omit to take any action necessary to prevent any such representation or
warranty from being inaccurate in any respect at any such time.

have been required to be set forth or described in a Schedule to this
Agreement or in the Disclosure Letter, or that constitutes a breach or
prospective breach of this Agreement by Seller.

  



  

Section 5.03 _No Negotiation with Third Parties_. From the date hereof until
the earlier of the Closing Date or the date on which this Agreement
is terminated, none of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates,
stockholders, directors, employees, agents or representatives shall, directly
or indirectly, encourage, solicit or engage in any discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning the
possible acquisition by such third party of all or any part of the Business
or the Purchased Assets other than as contemplated or permitted by this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.04 _Certain Indebtedness_. At or prior to the Closing, Seller

Section 5.05 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Sellers agrees that from the Closing until the sixth
anniversary of the Closing, it will not directly or indirectly engage or
invest in any business in competition with the Business as conducted
immediately prior to the Closing. **** Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Section 5.05(a) shall not prohibit the Sellers, directly or through any
Affiliate, from (i) conducting any business activities conducted by them as
of the date of this Agreement (other than any activities related to the
Business); (ii) investing in or holding not more than 5% of the outstanding
capital stock or other ownership interests of any Person whose equity
securities are listed on a national securities exchange; (iii)
hereafter acquiring and then continuing to own and operate any entity which
has operations that compete with the Business if (A) such operations
account for no more than 5% of Seller Parents consolidated revenues at the
time of and without giving effect to such acquisition and (B) provided Seller
Parent and its Affiliates commence reasonable efforts to divest all of the
business of such acquired entity engaged in activities that compete with the
Business as soon as practicable, but in no event later than six (6) months
after such acquisition; (iv) selling inventory or other assets then owned by
any Seller; (v) exercising its rights pursuant to the Supply Agreement and

(b) Each of the Sellers agrees that from the Closing until the third ****
anniversary of the Closing, it will not directly or indirectly solicit or
recruit any Transferred Employees or encourage any Transferred Employee to
terminate his or her employment with any Buyer (in each case other than

of the Sellers nor their Affiliates shall be prohibited from hiring any
Transferred Employee who

  



  

42   

     
   

  



  

contacts Sellers or their Affiliates in the absence of any solicitation or
recruiting by Sellers or their Affiliates prohibited by this Section 5.05(b).
_Schedule 5.05(b)_ shall also apply to this subsection (b).

  



  

(c) If a final judgment of a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction
determines that any term or provision contained in this Section 5.05 is
invalid or unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal
will have the power (but without affecting the right of Sellers or Buyers to
obtain the relief provided for in this Section 5.05 in any jurisdiction other
than such courts or tribunals jurisdiction) to reduce the scope, duration
or geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.
This Section 5.05 is reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve Buyers
legitimate business interests and the value of the Business, the Purchased
Assets and the Sold Shares, and to prevent any unfair advantage conferred on
Sellers and their successors. To the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable Law, each Seller hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of
its successors, any provision of law which renders any provision of this
Section 5.05 invalid, void or unenforceable in any respect.

(a) Within two (2) Business Days subsequent to the Closing Date, Buyers agree

(b) No later than December 31, 2005, Buyers shall vacate those premises set
forth on _Schedule 5.06(b)_ in broom clean condition, provided that this

partys counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other authorized
representatives such financial and operating data and other information
relating to the operation of the Business and access to its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives as such
Persons may reasonably request in compliance with applicable Law and
in connection with the purchase of the Purchased Assets and the assumption of

43   

     
   

  



  

Section 6.02 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.  Subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties to this
Agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
desirable under applicable Laws and regulations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as is
reasonably possible. Sellers and Buyers each agree to execute and deliver
such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take
such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to vest in Buyers good and marketable title to the Purchased Assets. The
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at the Sellers own
expense, to obtain any Consent required under Section 3.04.  The Buyers
agree to cooperate reasonably with the Sellers in obtaining such Consents. To
the extent that the Sellers and the Buyers are unable to obtain any such
Consents prior to the Closing (such consents, the " _Post-Closing Consents_
"), each of the Sellers and the Buyers, respectively, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make or obtain (or cause to be made or obtained) as
promptly as practicable all Post-Closing Consents. Buyers and Sellers each
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist the other in the
collection of accounts receivables that are related to the Business and are
outstanding as of the Closing Date. In addition, should the parties not have
effected a change in the legal name of the Sold Companies contemporaneous
with the Closing, Buyer shall cause the legal name of each Sold Company to be
changed as soon as commercially reasonable following the Closing (or the
China Transfer or Malaysia Transfer, as applicable) to a legal name not using
the word "Teradyne" or "TCS", except as permitted under the Intellectual
Property Assignment Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_commercially reasonable efforts_ " shall not be deemed to require any Person
to pay or commit to pay any amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of)
any Person from whom any consent or waiver may be required (other than
nominal filing or application fees).

  



  

Section 6.03 _Competition Laws Filings_. To the extent required
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, within

of the Sellers and the Buyers shall promptly make or cause to be made any and
all required filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), and will request early termination
of the waiting period required under the HSR Act. The parties agree to
cooperate fully and respond promptly to any inquiries or investigations
initiated by the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the Department
of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") in connection with any such filings. The parties
will promptly make any filings or notifications under Other Competition Laws,
as set forth on _Schedule 9.01(a)_, and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Consents required under Other Competition
Laws as promptly as is reasonably possible.

  



  

Section 6.04 _Certain Filings_.  Sellers and Buyers shall cooperate with one
another (a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, including any Environmental
Authorization, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to
be obtained from parties to any Material Contracts, in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b)
in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing information
required in connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Sellers shall (subject to
reimbursement by Buyer Parent to Sellers of filing and other similar fees
incurred by Sellers in

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

connection therewith) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyers in
application for the transfer to Buyers of the Environmental Authorizations so
indicated on _Schedule 6.04_ and Buyers and Sellers each agree to promptly
take and complete the actions identified on _Schedule 6.04_ with respect to
such Environmental Authorizations. Ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, Sellers may (in their sole and absolute discretion) request that
any Environmental Authorizations not transferred or assigned to Buyers
in connection with the transaction contemplated hereunder be terminated.

  



  

Section 6.05 _Public Announcements_. The parties agree to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement or
disclosure with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and, except as may be required by applicable Law or any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, will not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement or disclosure prior to
obtaining the other partys written consent.

  



  

Section 6.06 _Updating Schedules_. From time to time before the Closing, and
in any event immediately before the Closing, the Sellers may update the
Disclosure Letter to this Agreement to include any matter hereafter arising
or becoming known to the Sellers that, if existing, occurring, or known at or
before the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in the Disclosure Letter to this Agreement, or that is
necessary to correct any information provided by the Sellers in the
Disclosure Letter that is or has become inaccurate (the " _Updates_ "). The
Updates shall not be given effect for any purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 6.07 _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_.

  



  

(a) Whether or not the Closing takes place, and except as otherwise specified
in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.
 Subsequent to the Closing, the parties agree to share certain proceeds, as
set forth on _Schedule 6.07(a)._

  



  

(b) All Transfer Taxes applicable to the conveyance and transfer from Sellers
to Buyers of the Sold Shares, Sold Companies, the Business or the Purchased
Assets and any other transfer or documentary Taxes or any filing or recording
fees applicable to such conveyance and transfer shall be paid fifty percent
(50%) by Buyers and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. Each party shall use
reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions from any such
Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the other parties in providing any
information and documentation that may be necessary to obtain such
exemptions.

  



  

(c) Certain fixed assets located in China were imported by Seller into China
duty-free under the "blue book" exemption. To the extent Seller is unable to
receive consent by Chinese custom authorities to apply this exemption to the
transfer of these assets to the Buyer and a value-added Tax payment
is required to be made by a Seller, Seller Parent shall be responsible for
such value-added Tax and Buyer Parent agrees to pay Seller Parent fifty
percent (50%) of such payment as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

Section 6.08 _Assignments_. Sellers shall prepare all assignments
of Purchased Intellectual Property required hereunder and provide such
assignments to Buyers in recordable form. All filing or recordation fees and
similar expenses incurred in connection with such assignments shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by Seller Parent and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer Parent.

  



  

Section 6.09 _Lease_. To the extent that the consent of the landlord to an
assignment to Buyer Parent (or an Affiliate thereof) of the guaranty given by
Seller Parent with respect to the Dublin Lease or the Mexicali Lease, each as
described in _Schedule 1.01(d)_, thereunder is not obtained on or prior to
the Closing, Seller Parent agrees that it shall remain bound by the terms of
such guaranty with respect to payment obligations for the term of such lease
until such consent is obtained. If Seller Parent is required to make
any performance pursuant to either such guaranty on or subsequent to the
Closing, Buyer Parent shall hold harmless and promptly indemnify Seller
Parent for any and all costs, expenses and payments incurred in such
performance upon written notice, provided that either (a) no consent by the
lessor under such lease to the assignment of such lease by the applicable
Seller to the relevant Buyer was required pursuant to such lease or
applicable Law, or (b) consent by the lessor under such lease to the
assignment of such lease by the applicable Seller to the relevant Buyer was
required pursuant to such lease or applicable Law and such consent was
obtained.

  



  

ARTICLE VII

  



  

 _TAX MATTERS_

  



  

Section 7.01 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Seller Parent shall (i) timely prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax
Returns in respect of all Sold Companies for all Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date, (ii) timely file, or cause to be filed, all such Tax
Returns and (iii) timely pay or cause to be paid when due all Taxes relating
to such Tax Returns. Any Tax Return described in the preceding sentence shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with the elections, accounting methods,
conventions, and principles of taxation used for the most recent Tax periods
for which Tax Returns have been filed, except as otherwise required
by applicable Tax law or otherwise agreed to in writing by Buyer Parent prior
to the filing thereof. Seller Parent shall provide Buyer Parent with a copy
of substantially final drafts of such Tax Returns no later than ten (10)
business days before the relevant Tax Return is due (taking into account
extensions), and Seller Parent shall incorporate therein any reasonable
comments timely provided in writing by Buyer Parent.

  



  

(b) Buyer Parent shall timely prepare, or cause to be prepared, all Tax
Returns in respect of all Sold Companies that relate to a Tax period
beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "
_Straddle Period_ "). Without duplication of Section 2.07 and 2.12, Taxes in
respect of such Tax Returns shall be apportioned between Seller Parent and
Buyer Parent, (i) in the case of Taxes not measured or measurable, in whole
or in part, by net or gross income or receipts, on a per diem basis, and (ii)
in the case of other Taxes, as determined based on a closing of the books as
of the close of business on the Closing Date and otherwise consistent with
the prior practice of Seller Parent, the Sellers and the Sold Company with
respect to the

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

income, properties or operations of the Sold Company. If a Sold Company is
permitted under applicable Tax law to treat the Closing Date as the last day
of a Tax period, Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall treat (and cause their
respective Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date as the last day of a Tax
Period. Buyer Parent shall provide Seller Parent with a copy of substantially
final drafts of such Straddle Period Tax Returns no later than ten (10)
business days before the relevant Tax Return is due (taking into account
extensions), and Buyer Parent shall incorporate therein any reasonable
comments timely provided in writing by Seller Parent. Buyer Parent shall cause
the Sold Companies to file all Straddle Period Tax Returns, and each Sold
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, all Taxes shown as due on any such
Straddle Period Tax Returns. Seller Parent shall pay Buyer Parent, as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price, its share of any such Taxes due pursuant
to the filing of any such Straddle Period Tax Returns under the provisions of
this Section 7.01(b) (to the extent the Seller Parent is liable therefor in
accordance with this Section 7.01(b) and to the extent not already paid by
the Seller Parent or the Sold Company or explicitly stated as a liability on
the Closing Balance Sheet) within ten (10) business days of Seller Parents
receipt of notice of such filing by Buyer Parent, which notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the calculations regarding Seller Parents share
of such Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of such notice, Seller Parent notifies Buyer
Parent in writing that Seller Parent disagrees with the computation of Seller
Parents share of such Taxes, Seller Parent and Buyer Parent shall proceed in
good faith to determine Seller Parents share of such Taxes. If Seller Parent
and Buyer Parent cannot agree in good faith on such share within thirty (30)
days after Seller Parents notice to Buyer Parent, Seller Parents share of
such Taxes shall be determined pursuant to Section 7.01(f), and Seller
Parents payment to Buyer Parent shall be due three (3) Business Days after
the amount payable by Seller Parent is determined by agreement between Seller
Parent and Buyer Parent or pursuant to Section 7.01(f). In all cases, Seller
Parent shall pay interest on such amount at a rate per annum equal to the
rate publicly announced from time to time by Citibank N.A. as its base
or prime rate in New York City in effect from time to time, such interest
to accrue from the date that is ten (10) Business Days after Seller
Parents receipt of notice of Straddle Period Tax Return filing by Buyer
Parent until the date of Seller Parents payment.

  



  

(c) Seller Parent shall have the right to represent the interests of each
Sold Company in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating
to Tax Returns described in Section 7.01(a); provided, however, that Buyer
Parent shall have the right to participate in any such audit or proceeding to
the extent that any such audit or proceeding may affect the Tax liability of
Buyer Parent, the Sold Company or any of their Affiliates for any Post-
Closing Tax Period and to employ counsel of its choice at its own expense for
purposes of such participation.  Without the prior written approval of Buyer
Parent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, neither Seller
Parent nor any Affiliate of Seller Parent shall agree or consent to
compromise or settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any issue or claim arising in any such audit or proceeding, or
otherwise agree or consent to any Tax liability, to the extent that any such
compromise, settlement, consent or agreement may increase the Tax liability
of Buyer Parent, any Sold Company or any of their Affiliates for any Post-
Closing Tax Period, unless Seller Parent indemnifies Buyer Parent for the
increase in Taxes resulting from such compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement.

  



  

(d) Buyer Parent shall have the right to represent the interests of each Sold
Company in any Tax Audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Tax Returns

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

described in Section 7.01(b); provided, however, that Seller Parent shall
have the right to participate in any such audit or proceeding to the extent
that any such audit or proceeding may affect the Tax liability of Seller
Parent, the Sold Company or any of their Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period and to employ counsel of its choice at its own expense for purposes of
such participation. Without the prior written approval of Seller Parent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, neither Buyer Parent nor
any Affiliate of Buyer Parent shall agree or consent to compromise or settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any issue or
claim arising in any such audit or proceeding, or otherwise agree to or
consent to any Tax liability, to the extent that any such compromise,
settlement consent or agreement may increase the Tax liability of Seller
Parent, any Sold Company or any of their Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, unless Buyer Parent indemnifies Seller Parent for the increase in
Taxes resulting from such compromise, settlement, consent or agreement.

  



  

(e) Seller Parent shall promptly notify Buyer Parent in writing upon receipt
by Seller Parent or any Affiliate of Seller Parent of notice of any pending
or threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the income, properties or
operations of any Sold Company. Buyer Parent shall promptly notify Seller
Parent in writing upon receipt of notice by Buyer Parent or any Affiliate of
Buyer Parent of any pending or threatened Tax audits for assessments relating
to the income, properties or operations of a Sold Company for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

  



  

(f) Any disputes between the parties with respect to the Tax matters
regarding Sold Companies in this Section 7.01 shall be resolved by a national
public accounting firm or a law firm reasonably satisfactory to Buyer Parent
and Seller Parent, whose fees and expenses shall be shared equally between
Buyer Parent and Seller Parent.

  



  

(g) If any credit, deduction or loss of any Sold Company arising in any Post-
Closing Tax Period is required to be carried back and included in any Tax
Return of any Seller, or any Affiliate of any Seller (excluding any Sold
Company) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, then the Sellers shall pay to the
Buyers an amount equal to the actual Tax savings produced by such credit,
deduction or loss; provided however, that the Sellers or such Affiliate shall
not be required to file any claim for refund of any Tax for the benefit of
the Buyers or the Sold Companies. Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller for any
Taxes resulting from any subsequent disallowance of such credit deduction or
loss.

  



  

(h) Any and all existing Tax sharing, allocation, compensation or like
agreements or arrangements, whether or not written, that include the Sold
Companies, including any arrangement by which the Sold Companies may be
obligated to make compensating payments to each other or any other member of
any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or other similar Tax group
for the use of certain tax attributes, shall be terminated as of the day
before the Closing Date (pursuant to a writing executed on or before the
Closing Date by all parties concerned) and shall have no further force or
effect. All liabilities of the Sold Companies to Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller (for Taxes or otherwise pursuant to such agreements or arrangements)
shall be canceled on or prior to the Closing Date. Any and all powers of
attorney relating to Tax matters concerning the Sold Companies shall be
terminated as to the Sold Companies on or prior to the Closing Date and shall
have no further force or effect.

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

(i) After the Closing Date, Buyer Parent, Seller Parent, the Buyers and the
Sellers shall provide each such person, and Buyer Parent shall cause each
Sold Company to provide each such person, with such cooperation and
information relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Sold
Companies as any other such person may reasonably request in writing in (i)
filing any Tax Return or amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund, (ii)
determining any Tax liability or right to refund of Taxes, (iii)
conducting or defending any audit or other claim, suit or proceeding in
respect of Taxes, or (iv) effectuating the terms of this Agreement. Such
persons shall retain, and Buyer Parent shall cause the Sold Companies to
retain, all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and all material records
and other documents relating thereto with respect to the Business, the
Purchased Assets and the Sold Companies, until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitation (and, to the extent notified by Seller
Parent or Buyer Parent to the other, as applicable, any extensions thereof)
with respect to the Tax periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents
relate and, unless such Tax Returns and other documents are offered and
delivered to Seller Parent or Buyer Parent, as applicable, until the
final determination of any Tax in respect of such periods. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no party shall be unreasonably required to prepare any
document, or determine any information, not then in its possession in
response to a request under this Section 7.01(i).

  



  

(j) Neither Buyer Parent nor any Affiliate will make any election under
Section 338 of the Tax Code with respect to any Sold Company.

  



  

ARTICLE VIII

  



  

 _EMPLOYEE BENEFITS_

  



  

Section 8.01 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a) Sellers shall deliver to Buyers a true and complete list, as of a date
within four (4) business days subsequent to the date hereof, of (i) the
names, titles, annualized salary and other compensation of all employees of
Sellers and the Sold Companies engaged in the Business and those employees of
Seller Parent not engaged in the Business, the identities of which Buyer
Parent and Seller Parent have agreed to in writing (together, the " _Business
Employees_ ") and (ii) all Persons who are currently performing services by
or on behalf of any Seller or Sold Company for the Business who are
classified as "consultants" or "independent contractors" (the " _Other
Personnel_ ").  Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the parties
shall act in accordance with _Schedule 8.01(a)(i)_ and, except as set forth
on  _Schedule 8.01(a)(ii)_, Buyers shall offer employment to all
such Business Employees, including those Business Employees who are at the
time on a military leave, a leave of absence under the Family Medical Leave
Act or comparable state law, workers compensation leave, or a short-term
disability leave. Such offers shall be at current salary levels received by
such persons.  Business Employees who accept Buyers offer of employment and
Business Employees who are employees of a Sold Company are herein referred to
as "Transferred Employees." For the avoidance of doubt, Buyers shall not be
obligated to continue or assume any liabilities with respect to any Employee
Plans or Benefit Arrangements of any Seller, other than from a Sold Company
(the Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements pertaining to which are
described on _Schedule 8.01(a)(iii)_), and, except as provided in Section
8.01(c), Sellers shall remain

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

responsible for the payment to the Transferred Employees of salary
and benefits through the Effective Time.

  



  

(b) Buyer Parent has entered into employment agreements with certain of the
Key Employees as of the date hereof and has provided Seller Parent with
copies of all such agreements. Buyer Parent has also made offers of
employment to those persons previously agreed in writing between Buyer Parent
and Seller Parent to be extended offers of employment prior to the date
hereof and Buyer Parent has provided Seller Parent with copies of all
such offers of employment.

  



  

(c) In connection with the termination of employment contemplated by this
Section 8.01, Business Employees of Seller located in the United States shall
be paid by Sellers one hundred percent (100%) of their accrued but unused
paid time-off pursuant to the Flex Time Program as of the Closing Date.
 Commencing on the day following the Closing Date, for Transferred Employees
in the United States, Buyer will provide each active Transferred Employee
advance access to his/her full years vacation accrual calculated
in accordance with Buyers vacation entitlement guidelines based on the
length of service for each Transferred Employee. With respect to the
treatment of vacation accrual at Buyer, _Schedule 8.01(c)_ shall also apply.

  



  

(d) The employment by Sellers of the Transferred Employees shall end at 11:59
p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the Closing Date, and the employment by Buyers
of the Transferred Employees who accept Buyers employment offers shall
commence immediately subsequent to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the
Closing Date (the " _Effective Time_ "), or such later time as mutually
agreed between Buyer and Seller. Accordingly, at the Effective Time or such
later time, Sellers shall treat all Transferred Employees as having had their
employment terminated with Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Transferred Employee who, as of the Closing, is classified by Sellers as
an employee on a military leave, a leave of absence under the Family and
Medical Leave Act or comparable state law, a workers compensation leave, or
a short-term disability leave under Sellers disability plan and who accepts
Buyers employment offer, shall commence employment with the Buyers on the
date (i) in the case of military leaves and leaves of absence under the
Family and Medical Leave Act or comparable state law, the leave entitlement
expires, and (ii) in the case of workers compensation and short-term
disability leaves, such Transferred Employee is able to resume employment in
accordance with Buyers policies and procedures in the capacity which such
Transferred Employee performed for Sellers prior to commencing such leave.
For avoidance of doubt, Buyers shall not be responsible for any liabilities
resulting to Sellers with respect to Business Employees who are offered
employment by Buyers in accordance with Section 8.01(a) but who do not accept
such offer of employment, provided Buyers have otherwise complied with the
terms of this Article 8 with respect to such Business Employees.

  



  

(e) Sellers will not take any action that would impede, hinder, interfere or
otherwise compete with Buyers effort to hire any Business Employees.
 Buyers shall not assume responsibility for any Business Employee unless and
until such employee commences employment with a Buyer. Buyers shall have no
obligation to pay any severance payments to which any Business Employee who
is not a Transferred Employee may be entitled as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyers shall not have any obligation
pursuant

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

to this Agreement with respect to any Business Employee who does not accept
employment with a Buyer prior to or at the Effective Time.

  



  

(f) In addition to the obligations of Buyers pursuant to 8.01(a) hereof,
Buyers shall make available to all Transferred Employees as of the Closing
Date employee benefit plans and arrangements that are comparable in the
aggregate to all employee benefit plans and arrangements that are available
to similarly situated employees of Buyers. In the United States those
benefit plans are as follows: **** medical, dental, vision, short-term
disability, basic long-term disability, optional long-term disability, basic
life insurance, basic accidental death and disability insurance, optional
life insurance, optional accidental death and disability, dependent life
insurance, flexible spending account (medical and dependent care), business
travel and accident insurance, 401(k) plan 100% match up to 5% of
compensation, severance benefits, and vacation/time off. Buyers shall cause
such plans to count, for purposes of eligibility and vesting, all service of
Transferred Employees counted for such purposes under corresponding Employee
Plans of Sellers. With respect to any "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) offered to Transferred Employees, Buyers shall (i)
cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitation to the same extent
such pre-existing condition was waived under an Employee Plan and (ii)
provide that any expenses incurred by a Transferred Employee during the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs under a similar Employee Plan
shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket limitations. Buyer Parent and Seller
Parent may agree in writing that Seller Parent shall extend to all or a
portion of the Transferred Employees the coverage of certain of Sellers
Employee Plans or Benefit Arrangements until December 31, 2005, in which case
Buyer Parent shall reimburse Seller Parent for expenses incurred by Seller
Parent in connection therewith.

  



  

(g) Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall select a date (no later than 90 days
after the Closing Date) as of which the entire account balances (including
loans) of the Transferred Employees under the Seller Parents 401(k) Plan
shall be valued and transferred, in a trustee-to-trustee transfer, to Buyer
Parents 401(k) Plan. Subject to the completion of such asset transfer in
accordance with this Section 8.01(g), and in consideration of such asset
transfer, Buyer Parent shall cause the Buyer Parents 401(k) Plan to assume
the liabilities attributable to the account balances of the Transferred
Employees under Seller Parents 401(k) Plan. Seller Parent shall be
responsible for matching contributions under Seller Parents 401(k) Plan for
the period from January 1, 2005 to the Closing Date and shall make the
appropriate payments or reimbursements as necessary to participants, Buyer
Parent, or Seller Parents or Buyer Parents 401(k) Plan, as appropriate, and
Buyer Parent shall be responsible for matching contributions under Buyer
Parents 401(k) Plan for the period from the Closing Date to the end of the
year. For the purpose of any year-end employment requirement for receiving
matching contributions under Seller Parents 401(k) Plan, Seller Parent shall
consider employment with any Buyer as employment with Seller Parent.

  



  

(h) No provision of this Article shall create any third party beneficiary or
other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) of any Seller or of any of its subsidiaries in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) with either Buyers or the
Business or any of their Affiliates, and no provision of this Section 8.01
shall create any such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits
that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any Employee Plan or
Benefit

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

Arrangement or any plan or arrangement that may be established by Buyers or
any of their Affiliates.

  



  

Section 8.02 _Labor Matters_. The Sellers agree that between the date hereof
and the Closing Date, they will cause the Sold Companies and the Asset
Sellers in respect of the Business not to effect or permit a "plant closing"
or "mass layoff" as these terms are defined in the WARN Act. The Buyers agree
that for ninety (90) days following the Closing Date, to the extent such an
action would create or be reasonably likely to create a liability for
Sellers, Buyers will not effect or permit a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
as such terms are defined in the WARN Act.

Section 10.02 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Sellers, jointly and severally, hereby indemnify Buyers and their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees,
agents and consultants (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") against and
agree to hold each of them harmless from, any and all damage, loss,
liability, deficiencies, written claims and expenses (including, without
limitation, expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses in
connection with any action, suit or proceeding) (collectively, " _Loss_
", which term shall be deemed to include any such damage, loss,
liability, deficiencies, written claims and expense to which a Buyer would
have been entitled to indemnity hereunder and which is asserted against such
Buyer by a transferee of any portion of the Purchased Assets to which such
Buyer would have been entitled to assign its rights to indemnity hereunder
pursuant to Section 12.04) incurred or suffered by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties arising out of:

  



  

(i) any breach of a representation and warranty made by Sellers pursuant to
Article III of this Agreement, the Bills of Sale, the Intellectual Property
Assignment Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of Real Estate Leases
referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term (it being agreed
and acknowledged by the parties that for purposes of determining the amount
of Loss sustained or incurred with respect to the breach of a representation
or warranty and whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any
such representation or warranty, the representations and warranties of
Sellers shall be deemed not qualified by any references therein to
materiality generally or to whether or not any breach results or may result
in a Material Adverse Effect, except that such words shall be given effect as
to whether or not matters are properly disclosed on any Schedule hereto or
the Disclosure Letter);

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

(ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Sellers
pursuant to this Agreement, the Bills of Sale, the Intellectual Property
Assignment Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of Real Estate Leases
referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term;

  



  

(iii) any Excluded Liability or Excluded Asset; or

  



  

(iv) subject to the provisions of Section 6.07(b) and (c) and Article
VII, any and all (A) Taxes imposed on any Seller or any Affiliate of any
Seller (including any Sold Company) for, or relating to, all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, including, but not limited to, (1) any liability of any Sold Company
under any Tax sharing or similar agreement, whether or not written, and (2)
any Tax liability resulting from the termination, as of the Closing Date, of
any Sold Company as a member of any consolidated, affiliated, combined,
unitary or other similar Tax group, and (B) liabilities of any Seller or
any Affiliate of any Seller (including, without limitation, any Sold Company)
for Taxes imposed under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any
analogous state, local or foreign tax provision, as a result of being a
member of a consolidated, affiliated, combined, unitary or other similar
group for any taxable period commencing before the Closing Date.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing,

  



  

(A) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Buyer
Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (a)(i) with respect to any single
Loss which is less than $200,000 on an individual basis (or as part of a
group of related claims, or claims that, although unrelated, originate from a
common set of facts);

  



  

(B) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Buyer
Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (a)(i) except to the extent that
the aggregate amount of Loss incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
(excluding any Loss for which indemnification would not be available as a
result of clause (A) above) exceeds $3,000,000, and only to the extent of
such excess;

  



  

(C) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL
SELLERS HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MAKE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS OR HAVE ANY
LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 10.02(a)(i) OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSS ARISING OUT
OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF FIFTY-EIGHT MILLION FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($58,500,000.00) (THE " _CAP_ ");

  



  

(D) The foregoing limitations provided for in Clauses (A), (B) and (C)
of this Section 10.02(a) shall not apply to any Loss arising out of
any breach of any of the Unlimited Representations.

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

(E) No Seller shall be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Loss resulting from Environmental
Liabilities, except to the extent such Loss actually is incurred by a Buyer
Indemnified Party in response to a Third Party Claim asserted by a person
unaffiliated with the Buyer for the performance of investigatory, assessment,
remedial or monitoring actions or the payment of costs therefor, the payment
of any fines, penalties or costs incurred or imposed by any Governmental
Authority or any damage or settlement award;

  



  

(F) No Seller shall be obligated to indemnify or hold harmless a Buyer
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss that is stated as a liability on
the Closing Balance Sheet to the extent of such stated liability, or for
which a reserve was made on the Closing Balance Sheet to the extent of such
reserve, other than those liabilities and reserves identified in the
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value as an Excluded Liability;

  



  

(G) This subsection (G) shall apply to any claim for indemnification by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties (or their permitted successors and assigns)
based on an Environmental Liability at the Purchased Real Property arising
from or relating to Hazardous Materials that have migrated into or onto the
Purchased Real Property as a result of Release of Hazardous Materials on
another property (" _Offsite Release Environmental Claim_ ").  In such
event, Sellers agree that they shall not assert as a defense (in whole or in
part) to any request for indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties (or their permitted successors and assigns) that the Offsite Release
Environmental Claim was caused or exacerbated in whole or part by, or that
Hazardous Materials migrated into or onto the Purchased Real Property from
properties currently or formerly owned or occupied by, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties. The foregoing sentence shall not limit or diminish any other defense
Sellers may otherwise be entitled to raise in response to any request for
indemnification hereunder by the Buyer Indemnified Parties.  Notwithstanding
any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Sellers expressly
reserve, and shall not be deemed to have waived, released or otherwise
discharged any Buyer from, any claims against any Buyer arising from or
relating to any Offsite Release Environmental Claim, so long as such claim is
not asserted as a defense, counterclaim, cross-claim, or setoff to
any request for indemnification hereunder by either the Buyer Indemnified
Parties (or their permitted successors and assigns), and (ii) Buyers
expressly reserve, and shall not be deemed to have waived, released or
otherwise discharged, any defenses, counterclaims or cross claims they may
have to such claims. Sellers shall retain the right to commence a separate
Proceeding asserting claims against any Buyer to recover any Loss arising
from or relating to an Offsite Release Environmental Claim. In the event that
any Seller shall

  



  

56   

     
   

  



  

commence a Proceeding described in the foregoing sentence, Buyers agree that:

  



  

(1) the existence or terms of any indemnification provided by Sellers
hereunder, the negotiations leading to execution of this Agreement, and any
settlement discussions relating to an indemnification claim shall not be
admissible as evidence in that Proceeding as to the liability of any Seller
or Buyer, or as the basis for any equitable allocation of liability among
them;

  



  

(2) with respect to any Loss that Sellers seek to recover in that Proceeding,
Buyers waive any right to claim that Sellers failed to mitigate such Loss or
that costs incurred by Sellers in response to any indemnification
requested hereunder by any Buyer Indemnified Parties are or were unreasonable
provided that Sellers discharge their indemnification responsibilities
hereunder, including pursuant to Section 10.03(b), in accordance with the
terms of this subsection (G); and

  



  

(3) Sellers may be represented in such Proceeding by counsel representing
Sellers as the Indemnifying Party responding to any such Third Party Claim
for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties request indemnification hereunder,
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to compliance with
clause (1) above, Buyers hereby waive any claims of conflict of interest
against Sellers and their counsel with respect thereto.

  



  

(H) No action may be commenced by any Buyer Indemnified Party against any
Seller Indemnified Party in respect of a claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 10.02(a) unless and until Seller Parent has first received written
notice from Buyer Parent of such claim as provided in Section 10.03(a)
(citing this Article X and providing reasonable detail with respect to such
event) and Seller Parent has failed to cure or remedy the event or
circumstance giving rise to such claim within ten (10) business days.

  



  

(b) Buyers, jointly and severally, hereby indemnify Sellers and their
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees,
agents and consultants (the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against and
agree to hold each of them harmless from any Loss incurred or suffered by the
Seller Indemnified Parties arising out of:

  



  

(i) any breach of a representation and warranty made by the Buyers pursuant
to Article IV of this Agreement, the Bills of Sale, the Intellectual Property
Assignment Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of Real Estate Leases
referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term (it being agreed
and acknowledged by the parties that for purposes of determining the amount
of Loss sustained or incurred with respect to the breach of a representation
or warranty and whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any
such representation or warranty, the representations and warranties of Buyers
shall be deemed not qualified by any references therein to

  



  

57   

     
   

  



  

materiality generally or to whether or not any breach results or may result
in a Material Adverse Effect, except that such words shall be given effect as
to whether or not matters are properly disclosed on any Schedule hereto);

  



  

(ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement, the Bills of Sale, the Intellectual Property
Assignment Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption of Real Estate Leases
referred to in clause (a) of the definition of such term; or

  



  

(iii) any Assumed Liability.

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing,

  



  

(A) Buyers shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a Seller
Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (b)(i) with respect to any single
Loss which is less than $200,000 ** __** on an individual basis (or as part
of a group of related claims, or claims that, although unrelated, originate
from a common set of facts);

  



  

(B) No Buyer shall have any obligation to indemnify or hold harmless a
Seller Indemnified Party under Section 10.02 (b)(i) except to the
extent that the aggregate amount of Loss incurred by the Seller Indemnified
Parties (excluding any Loss for which indemnification would not be available
as a result of clause (A) above) exceeds $3,000,000, and only to the extent
of such excess;

  



  

(C) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IN NO EVENT SHALL
BUYERS HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MAKE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENTS OR HAVE ANY
LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 10.02(b)(i) IN EXCESS OF FIFTY-EIGHT MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ($58,500,000.00); and

  



  

(D) The foregoing limitations provided for in Clauses (A), (B) and (C)
of this Section 10.02(b) shall not apply to any Loss arising out of
any breach of any of the Unlimited Representations.

  



  

(E) No action may be commenced by any Seller Indemnified Party against any
Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.02(b) unless and until Buyer Parent has first received written
notice from Seller Parent of the occurrence of such claim as provided in
Section 10.03(a) (citing this Article X and providing reasonable detail with
respect to such event) and Buyer Parent has failed to cure or remedy the
event or circumstance giving rise to such claim within ten (10) business
days.

  



  

(c) In determining the amount of any Loss for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to assert a claim for
indemnification under this

  



  

58   

     
   

  



  

Article X, the amount of any such Loss shall be determined after deducting
therefrom the amount of any insurance proceeds and other third
party recoveries, if any, actually received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
or Seller Indemnified Parties, as applicable, in respect of such Loss and
the amount of any tax benefit actually realized with respect thereto. If an
indemnification payment is received by a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, and such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, later receives insurance proceeds, other
third party recoveries, or actually realizes any tax benefits specifically in
respect of the related Loss, such Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, shall promptly pay to Seller Parent or
Buyer Parent, as applicable, a sum equal to the lesser of (y) the actual
amount of insurance proceeds, other third party recoveries, or the tax
benefits actually realized specifically in respect of the related Loss and
(z) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously paid by
Sellers or Buyers, as applicable, to such Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable, with respect to such Loss. Payments
made pursuant to this Article X shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

  



  

(d) Each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize fees and expenses that
may arise from or constitute part of a Loss at levels that are customary and
reasonable for similar claims in similar contexts.

  



  

Section 10.03 _Procedures; No Waiver; Exclusivity_.

  



  

(a) The party seeking indemnification under Article X (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") agrees to give prompt written notice to the party against whom
indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of any
claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in respect of
which indemnity may be sought under this Article X, such notice specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of the claim, suit, action or proceeding, the
basis for indemnification hereunder and the approximate dollar amount of Loss
for which indemnification is sought (if then reasonably qualifiable);
provided, however, that the failure to provide prompt notice as provided
herein will relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only
to the extent that such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party
hereunder. If such event involves any claim or the commencement of any action
or proceeding by a third person (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice
from the Indemnified Party to assume the control of the defense, compromise
or settlement of any such Third Party Claim, including, at its own
expense, employment of counsel; _provided,_ _however_ , that if the
Indemnifying Party shall have exercised its right to assume such control, the
Indemnified Party (i) may, in its sole discretion, employ counsel to
represent it (in addition to counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, and
at the Indemnified Partys sole expense) in any such matter, and in such
event counsel selected by the Indemnified Party shall be required to
cooperate reasonably with the Indemnifying Partys counsel in such defense,
compromise or settlement, and (ii) will, at its own expense, make reasonably
available to the Indemnifying Party those employees of the Indemnified Party
or any Affiliate of the Indemnified Party whose assistance, testimony or
presence is reasonably necessary to assist the Indemnifying Party in
evaluating and in defending any such Third Party Claim; _provided_  
_further_ , _however_ , that any such access shall be conducted in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operations of the
business of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates.  The Indemnifying
Party shall not consent to the entry of judgment, compromise or settlement of
any Third Party Claim,

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed in any case where such
judgment, compromise or settlement does not impose any obligation or require
any admission of responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified
Party (other than the payment of monies for which the Indemnified Party is
indemnified hereunder) and includes as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party and
its officers, directors, stockholders and employees of a general release from
all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified
Party shall in good faith determine that the conduct of the defense of any
Third Party Claim subject to indemnification hereunder or any proposed
consent to the entry of judgment, compromise or settlement of any such Third
Party Claim by the Indemnifying Party would reasonably be expected to affect
materially and adversely the ability of the Indemnified Party to conduct its
business in a manner that may not be adequately compensated by the money
damages, or that the Indemnified Party may have available to it one or more
defenses or counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those
that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Third
Party Claim or any litigation relating thereto, then the Indemnified Party
shall have the right at all times and upon prior written notice to the
Indemnifying Party to take over and assume control over the defense,
settlement, negotiations or litigation relating to any such Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnified Party shall so assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise or settle such claim, all attorneys fees and other
expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense, compromise or
settlement of such claim, to the extent related to the defense or
counterclaim that is inconsistent with one or more of the defenses or
counterclaims that may be available to the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such Third Party Claim or any litigation relating thereto, shall be at the
Indemnified Partys expense and shall not be eligible for indemnification
from the Indemnifying Party, but the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
be indemnified by the Indemnifying Party for the full amount of other Loss
suffered by the Indemnified Party as a result of or arising out of the Third
Party Claim including the attorneys fees and other expenses otherwise
incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense, compromise or settlement of
such claim. If the Indemnified Party does so take over and assume control,
(a) the Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the
written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed and (b) should the Indemnified Party receive
a binding written offer of settlement from the third party claimant to
consent to or enter into a judgment, compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim that does not impose any obligation or require any admission of
responsibility or liability on the part of the Indemnified Party (other than
the payment of monies for which the Indemnified Party is indemnified
hereunder) and includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each
claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors,
stockholders and employees a general release from all liability with respect
to such Third Party Claim, but the Indemnified Party does not consent to or
enter into such judgment, compromise or settlement, the Indemnifying Party
will not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that
any Loss exceeds the amount that the Indemnified Party would have reasonably
incurred had the Indemnified Party consented to or entered into such
judgment, compromise or settlement. If the Indemnifying Party does not
accept the defense of any matter as above provided within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the notice from the Indemnified Party described above,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the full right to defend against any
such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party
and shall be entitled to settle or agree to pay in full such Third Party
Claim with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, with respect to no claim for indemnification pursuant to Article
X (or as a part of a group of related claims, or claims that, although
unrelated, originate from a common set of facts) shall the Indemnified Party
be eligible for indemnification from the Indemnifying Party for the
attorneys fees and expenses of more than one legal counsel, plus local
counsel, to the Indemnified Party.

  



  

(b) Procedures Relating to Sellers Indemnification of Environmental Claims.

  



  

(i) _Notice_. Buyers will promptly notify Sellers in writing following
Buyers becoming aware of any Environmental Liability or breach of Section
3.17 which Buyers claim is subject to Section 10.02 (" _Environmental Claim_
"); provided, however, that Buyers shall notify Sellers within seven (7)
business days of their receipt of any written notice of an Environmental
Claim.

  



  

(ii) _Right to Remedy_. Sellers have the right (but not the obligation),
upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyers and subject to
the provisos below, to assume exclusive control of the resolution and remedy
of any Environmental Claim, including without limitation (1)
investigating the matter, obtaining tests, reports and surveys necessary to
define and delineate the extent of any contamination; (2) subject to the
provisions set forth in this paragraph below, contacting Governmental
Authorities, making reports and submitting plans and documents to such
authorities, negotiating with such authorities or other third parties and
otherwise dealing with such authorities; (3) preparing work plans for any
investigation, assessment, remediation or monitoring; and (4) conducting or
directing any such investigation, assessment, remediation or monitoring.
Sellers election to assume control of the resolution and remedy of any
Environmental Claim shall not be deemed an admission of fact, law or
otherwise by Sellers in any Proceeding other than to enforce the terms of
this Section 10.03(b). Upon receipt of Sellers written notice of this
election to assume exclusive control of the resolution and remedy of
an Environmental Claim, Buyers agree neither to: (a) enter into
negotiations or settlements with any Governmental Authority or third parties;
nor (b) at any time, take or offer to any Governmental Authority or third
party any position inconsistent with positions taken or offered by Sellers in
its sole and absolute discretion; provided that that Buyers shall have the
right to (A) receive copies of all correspondence between Sellers and
Governmental Authorities relating to Environmental Claims, (B) review any
report or proposal prior to its submission to any Governmental Authority or
third party and Sellers shall in good faith take into account any concerns or
issues raised by Buyers prior to its submissions to the Governmental
Authority or third party and (C) advance notice of and the right to
participate in any meeting with Governmental Authorities or third parties
relating to Environmental Claims and provided further that Sellers shall not,
without the prior written approval of Buyers, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement, agreement,
consent decree, order, or remediation plan involving an Environmental Claim.

  



  

(iii) _Cooperation_. Buyers and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith and
make available to each other such information as is reasonably necessary to
carry out the purposes of this Section 10.03(b). Buyers will provide any and
all reasonable assistance reasonably requested by Sellers in securing any
permits or approvals (including without

  



  

61   

     
   

  



  

limitation by holding in its name any such permit if required to be held by
Buyers by applicable Law) reasonably required to perform any investigatory,
assessment, remedial or monitoring activities; provided that expenses
incurred by Buyers in performing such assistance will be reimbursed by
Sellers and any such amounts reimbursed shall be applied towards the Cap.
Buyers will provide Sellers with, or cause Sellers to be provided with,
reasonable access (without charge) to relevant documents and records and to
the Purchased Real Property in order to perform any remediation,
investigation, assessment, sampling, monitoring, removal, cleanup or any
other action required to fulfill Sellers obligations under this Agreement.
Sellers agree that any access to the Purchased Real Property necessary to
carry out the purposes of this Section 10.03(b) will only be at hours and for
periods agreed to by Buyers in their reasonable discretion and that such
access will not materially interfere with Buyers business activities
conducted at such premises. Buyers will reasonably cooperate with the
implementation of any investigation, assessment, remedial or monitoring
activities, to the extent such activities do not materially interfere with
normal business activities conducted by Buyers.

  



  

(iv) _Satisfaction of Obligation_. Sellers will be deemed to have satisfied
their obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Environmental
Claim related to the Purchased Real Property when (i) the result meets or
exceeds the least stringent standards provided by applicable
Environmental Laws (including any standards based on the use of deed or land
use restrictions, institutional controls and/or resulting from any site-
specific risk assessments) subject to Buyers rights to review and approve
such standards, as set forth in the last sentence of this paragraph, based on
the use of the property on the Closing Date and applicable Environmental Laws
and (ii) with respect to any Environmental Claim initiated by any
Governmental Authority, upon receipt of a "no further action" letter, site
cleanup rehabilitation order or other written decision from any Governmental
Authority with competent jurisdiction over such Environmental Claim that no
further investigation, assessment, monitoring or remediation is required by
the Buyers (or Sellers if Sellers are the performing party).  Buyers
acknowledge that resolution of any Environmental Claim may require the
imposition of deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions and, so long
as such restrictions do not materially interfere with the use of the
Purchased Real Property as used by Sellers as of the Closing Date or
impose any material liability or obligation on Buyers, upon review of the
proposed deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions, Buyer shall
not unreasonably withhold or delay consent to the recording of any
such restrictions by Seller. Buyers right to review and approve, as
provided in the foregoing sentence, shall be limited to determining in good
faith whether the deed restrictions or similar land use restrictions proposed
by Sellers materially interfere with the use of the Purchased Real Property
as used by Sellers as of the Closing Date or impose any material liability or
obligation on Buyers.  Buyer shall have the right to review and approve any
standards provided under Environmental Laws that are proposed to be applied
by Sellers pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (iv) to determine in
good faith that such standards are consistent with and sufficient to satisfy
the related Environmental Claim.

  



  

(v) _Disclosure_. Each party will keep the other party reasonably informed
regarding any investigatory, assessment, remediation or monitoring activities
with respect to Environmental Claims and will provide the other party with
copies of all

  



  

62   

     
   

  



  

material monitoring, sampling and other data relating to such matters subject
to Buyers rights as described in the proviso in Section 10.03(b)(ii)(A), (B)
and (C). Sellers shall provide Buyers, or cause Buyers to be provided with,
true and correct copies (without charge) of all relevant documents and
records which Sellers obtain or prepare in order to perform any remediation,
investigation, assessment, sampling, monitoring, treatment, removal, cleanup
or other action required to fulfill Sellers obligations under this Agreement
(including by way of illustration and not limitation any Phase
I environmental reports and any Phase II environmental reports). Neither
party will notify any Governmental Authority or third party of the existence
or substance of facts and circumstances giving rise to an Environmental Claim
except as required by Law or with the consent of the other party.  If a
party believes it is necessary or appropriate, pursuant to a Law, to disclose
any such information, that party will first promptly notify the other party
of such requirement and the content and timing of any disclosure that it
proposes to make unless in the reasonable judgment of the party circumstances
and applicable Law require immediate notification.

  



  

(vi) _Investigations_. As long as Sellers shall have any obligations to
Buyers hereunder with respect to Environmental Claims, Buyers will not engage
in, permit or cause any subsurface investigations at or adjacent to
the Purchased Real Property, including sampling of soil or groundwater,
except (1) in the ordinary course in connection with construction activities
(including by way of illustration and not limitation obtaining any
construction financing for any such construction activities or entering into
any construction contracts wherein Phase I or Phase II environmental reports
are required with respect to any such construction activities by Buyers) by
Buyers at the Purchased Real Property; (2) in connection with the Release of
any Hazardous Material when in the Buyers reasonable judgment such
Release requires any Phase I or Phase II environmental reports in order
to ensure that such Release does not cause or has not caused an
Environmental Claim; (3) in connection with any proposed sale, transfer,
leasing, mortgaging or recording of other encumbrances, pledges or
hypothecation of any of the Purchased Real Property or change of control,
provided that any such proposed action is reasonably believed by Buyer to be
probable to occur (collectively, a " _Transfer_ ") in the event the Buyers
receive a written request in connection with any such Transfer by any third
party to obtain any Phase I or Phase II environmental reports; (4) in
connection with any pending or threatened claims of injury to person (each, a
" _Personal Injury Claim_ ") by any officer, director, employee, agent or
invitee of Buyers or the reasonable belief by Buyers that any such person may
have a Personal Injury Claim; (5) as may be recommended in a Phase
I environmental report with respect to the Purchased Real Property, upon
the written consent of Sellers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld;
or (6) as required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to Environmental
Laws to the extent that such requirement is not attributable to a request or
notification by Buyers not required by Environmental Laws.

  



  

(vii) _Buyers  Breach_. Buyers breach of Section 10.03(b)(vi) will relieve
Sellers, to the extent of any Loss suffered or incurred by such breach, of
its obligation to indemnify Buyers for any Environmental Claim if and to
the extent that such breach is materially prejudicial to Sellers ability
to remediate such Environmental Claim or otherwise prevents Sellers
from discharging their obligations hereunder.

  



  

63   

     
   

  



  

(viii) Sellers shall comply with Section 10.02(a)(G) in exercising their
rights and discharging their obligations under this Section 10.03(b).

  



  

(c) After the Closing, this Article X will provide the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy for the matters referred to in Section 10.02, other than as
provided in Section 12.13.

  



  

(d) _Executive Mediation_. Prior to commencing any action against the other
party under or on account of this Agreement or exercising rights pursuant to
Section 10.03(b)(vii), knowledgeable senior executive officers of each of
Buyer Parent and Seller Parent shall meet to discuss the dispute. If no
resolution is reached within thirty (30) days following submission of such
dispute to such officers, unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing, each
party may exercise any and all of its rights pursuant to this Agreement.
The foregoing shall not restrict the ability of a party to seek relief as
provided in Section 12.13.

  



  

ARTICLE XI

  



  

 _TERMINATION_

  



  

Section 11.01 _Termination_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

  



  

(i) by mutual written agreement of Seller Parent and Buyer Parent;

  



  

(ii) by the Buyer Parent, if (A) the Sellers shall have breached or failed
to perform in any material respect any of their obligations, covenants
or agreements under this Agreement, or if any of the representations
and warranties of the Seller set forth in this Agreement shall not be true in
any material respect, in each case such that Seller Parent could not deliver
to Buyer Parent at Closing an accurate certificate as contemplated by Section
9.02(a), and (B) such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not cured to
the Buyer Parents reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days after the
Buyer Parent gives the Seller Parent written notice identifying in reasonable
detail such breach, failure or misrepresentation;

  



  

(iii) by the Seller Parent, if (A) the Buyers shall have breached or failed
to perform in any material respect any of their obligations, covenants
or agreements under this Agreement, or if any of the representations
and warranties of the Buyers set forth in this Agreement shall not be true in
any material respect, in each case such that Buyer Parent could not deliver
to Seller Parent at Closing an accurate certificate as contemplated by
Section 9.03(a), and (B) such breach, failure or misrepresentation is not
cured to the Seller Parents reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days
after the Seller Parent gives the Buyer Parent written notice identifying in
reasonable detail such breach, failure or misrepresentation;

  



  

(iv) by either Seller Parent or Buyer Parent if consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby is subject to any nonappealable final order,
decree or

  



  

64   

     
   

  



  

judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction, and
such order, decree or judgment would either have or be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business or would restrain or prohibit
the material transactions that are contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements;

  



  

(v) by either Seller Parent or Buyer Parent if the Closing does not occur on
or prior to April 30, 2006; provided that such termination right shall not
be available to a party that has failed to fulfill its obligations under
this Agreement or whose acts or omissions have been a significant cause of
the Closing not occurring on or before such date.

  



  

(b) The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (ii),
(iii), (iv) or (v) of Section 11.01(a) shall give written notice of such
termination to the other party.

  



  

Section 11.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 11.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided, however, that if such termination shall result from the
willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of
the obligations of the other party or to perform a covenant of this Agreement
or from a willful breach by either party to this Agreement, a claim for
indemnification may be brought against the non-performing or breaching party
pursuant to and in accordance with Article X, provided that a claim for
indemnification shall not be the exclusive remedy in such case.  If this
Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby are
abandoned as described in Section 11.01, this Agreement shall become null and
void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of (i)
Section 6.07(a) relating to certain expenses, (ii) Articles I, X and XII,
(iii) Section 11.01 and this Section 11.02 and (iv) Section 6.05 relating
to publicity, which shall survive such termination. The parties shall cause
each of the China Purchase Agreement and Malaysia Purchase Agreement to be
terminated upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section
11.01.

arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each

67   

     
   

  



  

Section 12.07 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements,

Section 12.13 _Enforcement of Agreement_. Each party acknowledges and agrees
that the other party may be irreparably damaged if certain of the provisions
of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms
and that such breach of this agreement by a Seller may not be adequately
compensated in all cases by monetary damages alone.  Accordingly, in
addition to any other right or remedy to which any party may be entitled, at
law or in equity, it shall be entitled to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of
