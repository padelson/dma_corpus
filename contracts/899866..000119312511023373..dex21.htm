2.8.2 _Surrender and Payment Procedures_.

 

(a) _Company Capital Stock_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but no later than two Business Days after the Effective Time,
the Paying Agent shall mail to each Person who held shares of Company Capital
Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form (which will specify that delivery will
be effected, and risk of loss and title to any certificate(s) formerly
representing shares of Company Capital Stock will pass, only upon receipt of
such certificates by the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of certificate(s) formerly representing all of the
shares of Company Capital Stock held by such Stockholder in exchange for the
Stockholder Closing Payment (as defined below). As soon as reasonably
practicable, but no later than five Business Days after receipt by the Paying
Agent of certificate(s), properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer, formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock held by any
Stockholder for cancellation, together with such duly executed letter of
transmittal and any other documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will, in exchange therefor, pay to such
Stockholder (by wire transfer of immediately available funds (without
additional charge) if such holder provides valid wire instructions for such
purpose) an amount equal to (1) the amount payable to such Stockholder
pursuant to clause (i) of each of _Sections 2.5.3(a)(1)_ , _2.5.3(a)(2)_ ,
_2.5.3(a)(3)_ and  _2.5.3(a)(4)_ with respect to the shares formerly
represented by such certificate(s), less (2) such Stockholders Pro Rata
Portion (based only on the number of shares of Company Capital Stock formerly
represented by such certificate(s)) of the Adjusted Escrow Amount, less (3)
such Stockholders Pro Rata Portion (based only on the number of shares of
Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such certificate(s)) of the
Adjusted SR Fund Amount (such amount determined by subtracting clauses (2)
and (3) from clause (1) of this _Section 2.8.2(a)_, with respect to each such
Stockholder, being the " _Stockholder Closing Payment_ "), in each case
payable in cash to the holder thereof without interest and subject to
applicable Tax withholding. If payment of any portion of the applicable
Stockholder Closing Payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it will be a
condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (A) will have
paid any Taxes required by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person
other than the registered holder of the certificate(s) surrendered, and will
have established to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes have been
paid, or (B) will have established to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such
Taxes are not applicable. From and after the Effective Time,
until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.8.2(a)_, each
certificate formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock will be
deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
consideration set forth in this _Article 2_ , if any, in respect of such
shares formerly represented thereby in accordance with the terms hereof and in
the manner provided herein.

\- 29  (b) _Company Warrants_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, but no later than two Business Days after the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each Person who held Company Warrants as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) a letter of transmittal in
customary form (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk
of loss and title to any Company Warrant will pass, only upon receipt of the
agreement representing such Company Warrant by the Paying Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Company Warrants held by
such Person in exchange for the payment required to be made to such Person
pursuant to _Section 2.5.4(a)_ (in the case of Series B1 Preferred Warrants)
or _Section 2.5.4(b)_ (in the case of Common Stock Warrants). As soon as
reasonably practicable, but no later than five Business Days after receipt by
the Paying Agent of any such agreement representing a Company Warrant,
together with such duly executed letter of transmittal and any other
documents as may be reasonably requested by the Paying Agent, the Paying
Agent will, in exchange therefor, pay to the holder thereof (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds (without additional charge) if such holder
provides valid wire instructions for such purpose) the payment required to be
made to such Person pursuant to _Section 2.5.4(a)_ (in the case of Series B1
Preferred Warrants) or _Section 2.5.4(b)_ (in the case of Common Stock
Warrants), in each case payable in cash to the holder thereof without
interest and subject to applicable Tax withholding. If payment of any portion
of such consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Company Warrant is registered, it will be a condition of payment
that the Person requesting such payment (A) will have paid any Taxes required
by reason of the payment of those amounts to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Company Warrant surrendered, and will
have established to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such Taxes have been
paid, or (B) will have established to the satisfaction of the Buyer that such
Taxes are not applicable. From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered
as contemplated by this _Section 2.8.2(b)_, each Company Warrant will be
deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the applicable
consideration set forth in this _Article 2_ , if any, in respect of such
Company Warrant in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner
provided herein.

(c) _Series Bl Call Rights_. Promptly after the delivery of the Stockholder
Consent pursuant to _Section 6.1_, the Paying Agent shall pay to each Series
Bl Call Right Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account provided by such holder to the Paying Agent for such purpose at least
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to (i)
the Series Bl Call Purchase Price set forth next to such Series Bl Call Rights
Sellers name on _Exhibit D_ , less (ii) such Series Bl Call Right Sellers
Series Bl Call Pro Rata Portion of the Adjusted Escrow Amount, less (iii) such
Series Bl Call Right Sellers Series Bl Call Pro Rata Portion of the Adjusted
SR Fund Amount, in each case without interest and subject to applicable tax
withholding.

(d) _Net Closing Cash_. Promptly after the delivery of the
Stockholder Consent pursuant to _Section 6.1_, Buyer shall deposit (on
behalf of the Equityholders) [*] of the amount of the Initial Net Closing Cash
into the Escrow Account (the " _Initial Cash Deposit_ "), to be held in the

\- 30  2.8.3 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Capital Stock_. At
the Closing, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed, and
thereafter there will be no further registration of transfers of the shares of
Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company unless and until reopened
by the Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, the holders
of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares of Company Capital
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for
herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. After the Effective Time, the
Buyer will exchange, as provided in this _Article 2_ , any presented
certificate representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

2.8.4 _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following six months
after the Effective Time, or with respect to any Contingent Consideration, the
date on which the Buyer delivers such Contingent Consideration to the Paying
Agent, the Buyer will be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including, without limitation, any earnings received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not
been disbursed to Stockholders and thereafter such Stockholders will be
entitled to look only to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Legal Requirements) and only as general creditors thereof with
respect to such Stockholders applicable payment, upon and subject to delivery
of the duly executed applicable letter of transmittal and upon due surrender
of their certificates formerly representing shares of such stock, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any Stockholder
of the Company for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement.

2.8.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
certificate(s) which formerly represented shares of Company Capital Stock has
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer, the Buyer will pay such holder the payment to which such holder is
entitled, as provided in this _Article 2_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
the Buyer may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to issuing
such payment, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate(s) to deliver an agreement of indemnification in customary form
with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed and a bond in such sum as the Paying Agent may reasonably request
and the Buyer reasonably requires as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Paying Agent, the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each of
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent and any Paying Agent
designated by the foregoing will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Equityholder, such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other
Legal Requirement. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, the Escrow Agent or Paying Agent, such
deducted or withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Equityholder in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

\- 31  2.10 _Unclaimed Amounts_. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal
Requirements, none of the Paying Agent, Buyer, MergerSub or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any Equityholder for any amount of cash

property, escheat or similar law.

Representatives will have reasonable access to the work papers used by the
Buyer in the preparation of the Revised Closing Statement and any other
financial information and documents that the Stockholders Representatives
may reasonably request in connection with their review of the Revised Closing
Statement.

 

2.11.3 _Dispute Notice_. The Revised Closing Statement will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties unless the Stockholders
Representatives provide a written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to the Buyer
no later than the fifteenth day after delivery of the Revised Closing
Statement setting forth in reasonable detail (a) any item on the Revised
Closing Statement that the Stockholders Representatives believe is not
correct or has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP and (b) the correct
amount of such item in accordance with GAAP. Any item or amount to which
no dispute is raised in the Dispute Notice will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties.

2.11.4 _Resolution of Disputes_. The Buyer and the Stockholders
Representatives will attempt to resolve the matters raised in a Dispute Notice
in good faith. If the Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives are able to
agree on the amount of the Net Closing Cash, then they shall _prepare_ a
final Revised Closing Statement, which shall be final, conclusive and binding
on the Parties. If the Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives are unable
to so resolve the matters raised in a Dispute Notice within twenty Business
Days after delivery of the Dispute Notice, either the Buyer or the
Stockholders Representative may provide written notice to the other that it
elects to submit the disputed items to FTI Consulting (the " _Referee_ ").
The Referee will promptly, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association, review only those items and amounts
specifically set forth and objected to in the Dispute Notice, and shall
resolve those issues and issue a Revised Closing

Amount_ " shall mean [*] set forth on the Revised Closing Statement
determined to be final, conclusive and binding on the parties in accordance
with _Section 2.11.3_ or _2.11.4_ (the " _Final Closing Statement_ "), less
[*] of the fees and expenses of the Referee.

(a) If the Final Net Closing Cash Adjustment Amount is greater than the
Initial Cash Deposit (any such excess amount, the " _Additional Closing Cash_
"), then Buyer shall, within two Business Days after receipt of the Final
Closing Statement, distribute to the Equityholders an amount equal to the
Additional Closing Cash.

 

(b) If the Final Net Closing Cash Adjustment Amount is less than the Initial
Cash Deposit, (any such deficiency, a " _Buyer Closing Cash Payment_ "),
then, within two Business Days after receipt of the Final Closing Statement,
the Escrow Agent shall distribute (x) to the Buyer, an amount equal to the
Buyer Closing Cash Payment and (y) to the Equityholders, the amount (if any)
by which the Initial Cash Deposit exceeds the Buyer Closing Cash Payment.

(c) In the event of any payment from the Escrow Account to the Equityholders
or the Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.11.5_, the Buyer and the
Stockholders Representatives shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the
certificate required by Section 4(a) of the Escrow Agreement instructing the

2.12  _Milestone Payments_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Buyer agrees to make the following payments (collectively, the "

increased to reflect any imputed interest unless such Milestone Payments are
not paid when due.

conditions of this Agreement, including _Section 2.12.3_, Buyer shall make
each of the following Milestone Payments if the corresponding event is

2.12.3 _Conditions to Milestone Payments_.

2.12.3.1 _Earlier Patent-Limited Milestones_. Notwithstanding the provisions
of _Sections 2.12.1_  and _2.12.2_ , if at the time an Earlier Patent-Limited
Milestone is achieved, the Taligen Compound with respect to which such Earlier
Patent-Limited Milestone is achieved:

 

(a) is covered by a Valid US Claim and a Valid EU Claim, the applicable
Milestone Payment shall be [*] as set forth in  _Section 2.12.1_ or _2.12.2_
, as applicable;

(b) is covered by neither a Valid US Claim nor a Valid EU Claim, the
applicable Milestone Payment shall be [*] of the applicable Milestone Payment
if such Taligen Compound is a Development Stage Compound and no Milestone
Payment shall be made if such Taligen Compound is not a Development Stage
Compound; and 

(c) is covered by a Valid US Claim or a Valid EU Claim (but not both), the
applicable Milestone Payment shall be [*] of the applicable Milestone Payment
if such Taligen Compound is a Development Stage Compound and [*] of the
applicable Milestone Payment if such Taligen Compound is not a Development
Stage Compound.

 

At such time, if ever, as a Taligen Compound with respect to which an Earlier
Patent-Limited Milestone is achieved becomes covered by a Valid US Claim and
a Valid EU Claim, the portion of the Milestone Payment corresponding to such
Earlier Patent-Limited Milestone that was not paid as a result of the
provisions of this _Section 2.12.3.1_ but that would have been paid if such
Valid US Claim or Valid EU Claim had issued prior to achievement of such
Earlier Patent-Limited Milestone shall be paid within thirty days after the
issuance of such Valid US Claim or Valid EU Claim. For example, if a
Development Stage Compound satisfies the [*] Milestone at

---|--- 

\- 35   a time when it is covered by neither a Valid US Claim nor a Valid EU Claim
(such that [*] of the applicable Milestone Payment is paid pursuant to this
_Section 2.12.3.1_), and at a later date a Valid US Claim issues covering
such Development Stage Compound, then an additional [*] of the applicable
Milestone Payment shall be paid. If, at an additional later date, a Valid EU
Claim issues covering such Development Stage Compound, then the remaining [*]
of the applicable Milestone Payment shall be paid.

2.12.3.2 _European Milestones_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections
2.12.1_ and _2.12.2_ , if at the time a European Milestone is achieved, the
Taligen Compound with respect to which such European Milestone is achieved:

 

(a) is covered by a Valid EU Claim, the applicable Milestone Payment shall be
[*] as set forth in _Sections 2.12.1_ or  _2.12.2_ , as applicable; and

(b) is not covered by a Valid EU Claim, the applicable Milestone Payment shall
be [*] of the applicable Milestone Payment if such Taligen Compound is a
Development Stage Compound and [*] Milestone Payment shall be made if such
Taligen Compound is not a Development Stage Compound.

 

At such time, if ever, as a Taligen Compound with respect to which a European
Milestone is achieved becomes covered by a Valid EU Claim, any portion of the
Milestone Payment corresponding to such European Milestone [*] as a result of
the provisions of this _Section 2.12.3.2_, shall be [*] days of the issuance
of the Valid EU Claim.

 

2.12.3.3 _US Milestones_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Sections 2.12.1_
and _2.12.2_ , if at the time a US Milestone is achieved, the Taligen
Compound with respect to which such US Milestone is achieved:

(a) is covered by a Valid US Claim, the applicable Milestone Payment shall be
[*] as set forth in _Sections 2.12.1_ or _2.12.2_ , as applicable; and

 

(b) is not covered by a Valid US Claim, the applicable Milestone Payment shall
be [*] of the applicable Milestone Payment if such Taligen Compound is a
Development Stage Compound and [*] Milestone Payment shall be made if such
Taligen Compound is not a Development Stage Compound.

At such time, if ever, as a Taligen Compound with respect to which a U.S.
Milestone is achieved becomes covered by a Valid US Claim, any portion of the
Milestone Payment corresponding to such U.S. Milestone [*] as a result of the
provisions of this _Section 2.12.3.3_, shall be [*] days of the issuance of
the Valid US Claim.

2.12.3.4 A Taligen Compound is covered by a Valid EU Claim or a Valid US Claim
if the [*] of such Taligen Compound in the applicable country or territory
would infringe such claim, but for the fact that a member of the Buyer Rights
Group Chain is the owner or licensee of such claim.

---|--- 

\- 36  2.12.4 _Achievement of Milestones_. Each of the Milestone Payments set forth
above shall be paid one time only (regardless of the number of different
indications with respect to which such Milestones are achieved for a Taligen
Compound); _provided_ , _however_ , that as set forth in  _Section 2.12.1_,
multiple payments might be made for the [*] Milestone, subject to the
limitation that in no event shall the Milestone Payments paid in respect of
all [*] Milestones exceed [*] in the aggregate. Milestone Payments can
be earned on the same Taligen Compound with respect to the development of
such Taligen Compound in both Ophthalmic Indications and Non-Ophthalmic
Indications. Milestone Payments can be earned with respect to the development
of Taligen Compounds as monotherapies or as therapies in combination with
other drugs. If, upon achievement of [*] or subsequent Milestone with respect
to a Taligen Compound for an Ophthalmic Indication or a Non-Ophthalmic
Indication, a prior Milestone Payment for [*] or [*] that is set forth in
_Section 2.12.1_ or _Section 2.12.2_ has not been paid for such Taligen
Compound with respect to an Ophthalmic Indication or a Non-Ophthalmic
Indication, as applicable, then such [*] Milestone Payment for [*] or [*]
shall, subject to _Section 2.12.3_, [*] of the Milestone Payment for the [*]
achieved Milestone. If, upon achievement of any [*] Milestone or [*] Milestone
with respect to a Taligen Compound for an Ophthalmic Indication or a Non-
Ophthalmic Indication, [*] of the prior Milestone Payments for [*] or [*] has
not been paid for such Taligen Compound with respect to an Ophthalmic
Indication or a Non-Ophthalmic Indication, as applicable, then [*] Milestone
Payment(s) shall, subject to _Section 2.12.3_, be payable [*]. For purposes
of the achievement of the Milestones and the Milestone Payments, [*] and [*]
shall be the same Taligen Compound. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and by way of example, if [*] is the 1st Taligen Compound
Administered to a Human for Ophthalmic Indications and later [*] is
administered to a human for Ophthalmic Indications, [*] shall also be
considered to be the 1st Taligen Compound Administered to a Human and shall
not be the 2nd or 3rd Taligen Compound Administered to a Human for Ophthalmic
Indications. In such case, either [*] or [*] can earn [*] Milestone for the
1st Taligen Compound Administered to a Human for Ophthalmic Indications, but
each such Milestone is payable only once.

 

2.12.5 _Milestone Payments_.

(a) _Notice of Active Clinical Compounds; Notice of Termination of
Development_. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall provide the
Stockholders Representatives with prompt written notice upon any Taligen
Compound becoming an Active Clinical Compound.

(b) _Notice of Milestone Events_. Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall
provide the Stockholders Representatives with prompt written notice upon (x)
the achievement of each Milestone and (y) the issuance of any Valid US Claim
or Valid EU Claim that triggers a payment of a previously unpaid portion of a
Milestone Payment pursuant to _Section 2.12.3_. In the event that,
notwithstanding the fact that Buyer and Surviving Corporation have not given
such a notice, the Stockholders Representatives believe any such Milestone
has occurred or any such Valid US Claim or Valid EU Claim has issued, they
shall so notify Buyer in writing and shall provide Buyer data, documentation
or other information that supports his or her belief.

applicable Milestone Payment (less any amount that may be deducted from such
Milestone Payment and deposited in the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section
8.1.3_ (and subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 8.1.3_)).

(d) _Transfers of Product Rights_. If prior to the payment of all Milestone
Payments set forth in this _Section 2.12_ that potentially could become
payable with respect to a Taligen Compound, the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Affiliates directly or indirectly consummate a
sale, license or other transfer of rights or assets to develop or seek
Marketing Approval of such Taligen Compound, Buyer shall provide notice to the
Stockholders Representatives of the rights or assets so sold, licensed or
transferred and the name and address of the Person to whom such rights or
assets were sold, licensed or transferred within five Business Days following
such sale, license or transfer. Nothing in this _Section 2.12.5_ or in any
instrument effecting such sale, license or transfer shall relieve Buyer of
any of its obligations to pay the Milestone Payments under this _Section
2.12_, and Buyer shall remain primarily liable for the performance of such
obligations and for the diligence obligations set forth in _Section 2.12.6_
notwithstanding any such sale, license or other transfer.

(e) _Reports_. Until the earlier of [*] years from the Closing Date and the
date on which Buyer is, in compliance with _Section 2.12.6_, no longer [*] of
any Taligen Compounds and subject to the terms of the Stockholders Rep

been granted to or by the Company (the " _Real Property_ "), and specifies the
lessor(s) of such leased property and identifies each lease or any other
Contractual Obligation under which such property is leased (the " _Real
Property Leases_ "). There are no written or oral subleases, licenses,

Property) in possession of the leased Real Property. With respect to each
Real Property Lease that is a sublease, to the Companys Knowledge, the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.11.2_ are true and
correct with respect to the underlying lease. No event, occurrence, condition
or act has occurred, is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, is threatened
in writing, which with the giving of notice, lapse of time, or the happening
of any further event, occurrence, condition or act, would constitute a breach
or default by the Company or, to the Companys Knowledge, any other party to
such Real Property Leases, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or to loss of a benefit under, or to increased, additional,
accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any Person under any such
Real Property Leases, except in each case in this sentence as would not
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company. There are no disputes,
oral agreements or forbearance programs in effect as to any Real Property
Lease.

disturbance and attornment agreements related thereto.

3.11.3 To the Companys Knowledge, no eminent domain or condemnation Action

covenant that affects any of the Real Property.

Property included in the Assets and all of the tangible personal property
included in the Assets (the " _Equipment_ ") in the aggregate are in

the Disclosure Schedule identifies the owner of record and, if different, the
beneficial owners of such item and, for items of Registered Intellectual
Property that are licensed to the Company from a third party, identifies the
owner of record (and, if different and the difference is known to the Company,
the beneficial owners of such item), the Inbound IP Agreement under which
such item is licensed and whether such license is exclusive

arrangement under which any third party has granted to the Company a license
or other current or contingent rights with respect to Intellectual Property or
Technology (other than non-exclusive licenses to use Off-the-Shelf Software)
(" _Inbound IP Agreements_ ") and each item of Registered Intellectual
Property subject thereto, and (ii) each Contractual Obligation or other
arrangement under which the Company has granted to any third party a license
or other current or contingent rights (including without limitation any
financial agreements in which Intellectual Property or Technology have been

_Outbound IP Agreements_ " and together with the Inbound IP Agreements, the "
_IP Agreements_ ") and each item of Registered Intellectual Property subject
thereto. Other than the IP Agreements identified in  _Section 3.13.2_ of the

3.18_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not a party to any options,
licenses, agreements, or covenants of any kind relating to the Intellectual
Property or Technology of the Company, nor is the Company a party to any

respect to the Intellectual Property or Technology of any other
Person, including without limitation, consulting agreements, agreements with

with other Persons. Except as provided in the Outbound IP Agreements
identified on _Section 3.13.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company is not
obligated to indemnify any Person against a charge of infringement of
Intellectual Property. Each of the IP Agreements (i) constitutes an
Enforceable Contractual Obligation of the Company and, to the Companys
Knowledge, the other respective party or parties thereto, and, to the
Companys Knowledge, is in full force and effect, (ii) assuming there are no
facts or circumstances concerning the Buyer or its Affiliates that would cause
this clause (ii) to be untrue, will be in full force and effect on
substantially similar terms immediately following the Closing and (iii)
represents the complete agreement between the Company and the other respective
party or parties thereto relating to the Intellectual Property that is the
subject of such Contractual Obligation. The Company has in all material
respects performed its obligations under each of the IP Agreements and the
Company is not (with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or
both) in material breach or default under any IP Agreement and, to the
Companys Knowledge, no other party to any of such Contractual Obligation is
(with or without the lapse of time or the giving of notice, or both) in
material breach or default thereunder. None of the other parties to the IP
Agreements has given any written notice to or made a claim in writing against
the Company with respect to any breach or default under the IP Agreements.
Complete and correct copies of the IP Agreements (including all amendments,
supplements and waivers thereto) have been made available to Buyer.

\- 51  3.13.3 _Title_. The Company owns all rights, title, and interests in and
to (i) the Registered Intellectual Property required to be identified on
_Section 3.13.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule (other than the Intellectual
Property identified on _Section 3.13.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule as being
owned by a third party) and (ii) to the Companys Knowledge, all Intellectual
Property that is necessary for the development, manufacture, use or sale of
the Development Stage Compounds as currently formulated and manufactured
(other than Registered Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property
licensed to the Company under an Inbound IP Agreement identified on _Section
3.13.2_ of the Disclosure Schedule), in each case free and clear of any
Encumbrance, other than Permitted Encumbrances. All assignments to the
Company of inventorship, authorship or ownership rights relating to Registered
Intellectual Property are valid and enforceable. Each of the Patents
identified on _Section 3.13.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule as being owned by
the Company properly identifies each and every inventor of the claims thereof
as determined in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which such
Patent is issued or such Patent is pending. To the Companys Knowledge, each
of the Patents identified on _Section 3.13.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule as
being exclusively licensed to the Company properly identifies each and every
inventor of the claims thereof as determined in accordance with the laws of
the jurisdiction in which such Patent is issued or such Patent is pending. For
purposes of this Agreement, all references to Patents that are exclusively
licensed by the Company will be deemed to be include Patents for which the
Company has a non-exclusive license with an option for an exclusive license.
Each inventor named on the Patents owned by the Company and identified on
_Section 3.13.1_ of the Disclosure Schedule has executed an
agreement assigning all of his, her or its rights, title and interests in and
to such Patent and the inventions or design embodied and claimed therein, to
the Company. To the Companys Knowledge, each inventor named on the Patents
licensed to the Company and identified on _Section 3.13.1_ of the Disclosure
Schedule has executed an agreement assigning all of his, her or its rights,
title and interests in and to such Patent and the inventions or design
embodied and claimed therein, to the applicable owner. No inventor named on
any such Patent that is owned by the Company has any Contractual Obligation or
other obligation that would preclude any such assignment of such inventor to
the Company. To the Companys Knowledge, no inventor named on any such Patent
that is exclusively licensed to the Company has any Contractual Obligation or
other obligation that would preclude any such assignment of such inventor to
the applicable owner.

 

3.13.4 _Validity and Enforceability_. To the Companys Knowledge, the
Registered Intellectual Property owned by the Company is valid and
enforceable (or in the case of applications therefor, such applications are
pending). All Registered Intellectual Property owned by the Company and, to
the Companys Knowledge, all Registered Intellectual Property licensed by
the Company, is currently in compliance with all Legal Requirements, other
than any Legal Requirement that, if not satisfied, with respect to such
Registered Intellectual Property would not result in a revocation,
cancellation, or lapse or otherwise adversely affect its enforceability, use,
or priority. The Company, and to the Companys Knowledge, third parties, have
not engaged in any inequitable conduct, Patent or copyright misuse, or fraud,
or failed to comply with any applicable duty of candor, in connection with
the prosecution of any Registered Intellectual Property or the enforcement or
licensing of any such Registered Intellectual Property, in a manner that would
result in the abandonment, unenforceability or other limitation of such
Registered Intellectual Property. With respect to any Patent owned by or
exclusively licensed to the Company, (i) to the Companys Knowledge, there are
no published Patents, articles or other prior art references that, alone or
in combination with each other, would reasonably lead to the conclusion that
such Patent is invalid or unenforceable, (ii) the Company and, to the
Companys Knowledge, each other party to an IP Agreement, has met its duty
of candor as required by 37 C.F.R. Section 1.56 or similar U.S. or non-U.S.

is, to the Companys Knowledge, subject to any outstanding Governmental Order,
and no Action is pending to which the Company is a party or, to the
Companys Knowledge, threatened, that challenges the legality, validity,
enforceability, use or ownership of any Intellectual Property or Technology
owned by the Company. In addition, to the Companys Knowledge, (i) no
Intellectual Property or Technology exclusively licensed to the Company is
subject to any outstanding Governmental Order, and (ii) no Action is (x)

party or (y) threatened against the Company or the owner of such Intellectual
Property, in each case that challenges the legality, validity, enforceability,

use, sale, importation or other exploitation of the Development Stage
Compounds, including any written notice claiming that a Person must license or
refrain from using any Intellectual Property or Technology of any third party
in connection with the conduct of the business currently conducted by the
Company and proposed to be conducted or the development, manufacture, use,
sale or other exploitation of the

to any non-compete or other restriction on the operation or scope of their
businesses or any license as a result of any Contractual Obligation to which
the Company is a party, or (ii) any license being granted to any third party

business (the " _Federal Grants_ "). All applications for the Federal Grants
(including documents submitted in connection or support of such applications)
were true and correct in all material respects when submitted to the
applicable Governmental Authority. The Company is and, since the applicable
grant date has been, in compliance with each Federal Grant in all material
respects and has used all funds provided pursuant to a Federal Grant in a
manner consistent with the applicable Federal Grant. Assuming there are no
facts or circumstances concerning the Buyer or its Affiliates that would
cause this sentence to be untrue, the Federal Grants will be available on
substantially similar terms immediately following consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions.

such that no restrictions contained in any "fair price," "control share

of the Company in their capacities as such (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ "), with respect to any Losses incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a " _Claim_ "), to the extent such Claim
arises from an act or omission taken by them in good faith in their capacity
as a director or officer prior to the Effective Time but is asserted after the
Effective Time in the same manner and to the same extent as provided in the
Company Organizational Documents. Buyer will not, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation not to, amend or modify the provisions in the Company Organization

   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

---|--- 

\- 74   Effective Time, with respect to indemnification, exculpation or advancement
of expenses in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Company
Indemnified Parties or terminate such provisions prior to the sixth
anniversary hereof (the " _Indemnification Period_ "); _provided_ , _however_
, that the foregoing notwithstanding, the Buyer shall be entitled, at its
option, to amend or modify such provisions so long as Buyer provides the

during the remainder of the Indemnification Period that are at least as
protective as those set forth in the Company Organizational Documents
in effect at the Effective Time.

6.5.2 Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving
Corporation to purchase tail insurance coverage (the " _Tail Insurance

other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by

included as a Transaction Expense; provided that, if the premium for
such coverage would exceed $28,000, the Tail Insurance Coverage shall be
reduced in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Stockholders Representatives

Coverage and with other terms not less favorable than the terms in such Tail
Insurance Coverage.

employee benefit plan or policy relating to vacation, in each case with
respect to plans for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and
in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, to the extent that
such service credit was granted under the Company Employee Plans, subject to
offset for previously

---|--- 

\- 75   accrued benefits and determined in a manner so as not to result in any
duplication of benefits. In addition, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived
under any comparable plan of the Company and recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out of pocket limits under its medical and dental plans,
deductible and out of pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs with respect to plans for which the
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee
is offered participation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Buyer and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.6_ are included for the sole benefit of Buyer and the
Company, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i)
shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Company Plan or
other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (ii) shall limit
the right of Buyer or the Company to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
Company Plan or other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement
following the Effective Time, or (iii) shall create any third party
beneficiary or other right (x) in any other Person, including, without
limitation, any Continuing Employee or any participant in any Company Plan or
other employee benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement (or any dependent
or beneficiary thereof), or (y) to continued employment with the Company,
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

6.7 _Hiring Restriction_.

 

6.7.1 The parties acknowledge and agree that the retention of the services of
the Named Executive is a critical factor on which the Buyer has based its
decision to enter into this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, if,
during the period of eighteen months from and after the Closing Date, any
Management Company, Venture Capital Fund, Commonly Controlled Affiliate or any
of the Entities in which any Venture Capital Fund or any Commonly Controlled
Affiliate holds an Equity Interest (each such entity, a " _Portfolio Company_
") (collectively, the " _Restricted Parties_ ") hires the Named
Executive (whether as employee, consultant, independent contractor or
otherwise) (the " _Hiring Restriction_ "), then the Buyer shall be entitled,
as compensation, to withdraw from the Escrow Account (to the extent such funds
are available or become available for release from the Escrow Account) the
Applicable Percentage of the Liquidated Damages Amount. In any circumstance
where Buyer is entitled to a payment from the Escrow Account pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute to Buyer the amounts so provided
to be distributed to Buyer. The Buyer acknowledges that (i) its sole right to
collect the Applicable Percentage of the Liquidated Damages Amount shall be
through a deduction from the Escrow Account, (ii) that the Escrow Account may
not contain sufficient funds to pay the Buyer all or a portion of the
Applicable Percentage of the Liquidated Damages Amount, and in this event the
Buyer shall have no other right to collect the remainder of the Applicable
Percentage of the Liquidated Damages Amount until such time (if ever) as
additional funds are deposited into the Escrow Account pursuant to  _Section
8.1.3_ of this Agreement, at which point Buyer shall be entitled to collect
such remainder and (iii) under no circumstances shall the Buyer be permitted
to collect the Applicable Percentage of the Liquidated Damages Amount through
a claim directly against any Venture Capital Fund or any other Equityholder.

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
---|--- 

\- 76  6.7.2 The parties acknowledge and agree that in the event that a Restricted
Party hires the Named Executive, actual damages would be difficult, if not
impossible, to ascertain and the Applicable Percentage of the Liquidated
Damages Amount represents the best estimate of such damages. The parties also
acknowledge and agree that payment of the Applicable Percentage is intended
as compensation and is not intended as and is not a penalty. If the Applicable
Percentage of the Liquidated Damages Amount, as applicable, is not paid when
due, interest shall accrue for the benefit of the Buyer on such unpaid amount
at rate per annum equal to 2.00% plus the prime rate announced by Citibank,
N.A., from time to time, effective from the date that payment was due,
compounded monthly, to the date such amount is paid.

 

For purposes of this _Section 6.7_, " _Equity Interests_ " means (a) any
capital stock, share, partnership or membership interest, unit of
participation or other similar interest (however designated) in any Person and
(b) any presently exercisable option, warrant, purchase right, conversion
right, exchange rights or other similar contractual obligation which would
entitle any Person to acquire any such interest in such Person or otherwise
entitle any Person to share in the equity, profit, earnings, losses or gains
of such Person (including stock appreciation, phantom stock, profit
participation or other similar rights). For the avoidance of doubt, a right
to acquire capital stock pursuant to a contractual right that is contingent on
the actions of the issuer of such capital stock or a third party (such as a
preemptive right or a right of first refusal to acquire shares of capital
stock in the event that the issuer issues shares of capital stock) shall not
be considered for purposes of determining any Venture Capital Funds or
Commonly Controlled Affiliates Equity Interests in such issuer.

6.8 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing Date, upon the request of
either the Stockholders Representatives or the Buyer, each of the Parties
hereto will do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such further acts,
assurances, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances and other instruments
and papers as may be reasonably required or appropriate to carry out the
Contemplated Transactions; provided that any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with any such request shall be borne by the requesting
Party.

which the Agreement is terminated, the " _Termination Date_ ") at any time
prior to the Effective Time:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Company; or

(b) by the Buyer, if the Stockholder Consent has not been delivered to the
Buyer within one hour after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement - other than the
provisions of _Sections 6.3_ (Publicity), this _7.2, 10.10_ (Governing Law),

Organizational Documents), _4.5_ (Title) and _4.6_ (No Brokers), with respect

such claim is not resolved by such date (such claim, an " _Unresolved Claim_
"), or a Buyer Indemnified Person has made a good faith claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ after the Escrow Termination Date
(such claim, an " _Additional Claim_ " and the amount of Losses claimed, the
" _Additional Claim Amount_ "), (ii) in the case of an Unresolved Claim, such
indemnification claim or entitlement is for an amount that exceeds the amount
then remaining in the Escrow Account (if any) (such excess amount, the "
_Unresolved Claim Amount_ "), and (iii) (x) Buyer thereafter becomes obligated
to make a Milestone Payment pursuant to _Section 2.12_ on or prior to [*],
Buyer may deposit in the Escrow Account a portion of such Milestone Payment

a Milestone Payment pursuant to _Section 2.12_ [*], Buyer may deposit in the
Escrow Account a portion of such Milestone Payment equal to the lesser of (1)
the Excess Claim Amount or (2) [*]. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if, at any
time, the Excess Claim Amount exceeds the Escrow Account Addition (as defined

Shortfall_ "), any such Excess Claim Shortfall will be included in the next
Escrow Account Addition (subject to the limitations set forth in this 
_Section 8.1.3(a)_) and (ii), any entitlement to indemnification that may
serve as the basis for the Buyers depositing into the Escrow Account any
portion of a Milestone Payment pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set
forth in, this _Section 8.1.3_ must be based on a claim for indemnification
set forth in an Indemnification Certificate delivered on or prior to the
applicable Survival Date, and the provisions of this _Section 8.1.3_ shall
not extend any Survival Date.

(b) In any case where Buyer is entitled to deposit a portion of a Milestone
payment in the Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 8.1.3(a)_, Buyer shall,
within five Business Days after the date on which the payment of Milestone
Payment against which such right was exercised is then due, (i) deposit the

8.1.3(a)_ (each such payment, an " _Escrow Account Addition_ ") for the

Agreement with respect only to the claim or, in the event there are not
sufficient funds to satisfy all of the Unresolved Claims and Additional
Claims, claims that were the basis for Buyers exercise of its rights in this
_Section 8.1.3_ and (ii) deliver a written notice to the Stockholders
Representatives stating that Buyer has exercised its right to deposit a
portion of such Milestone Payment in the Escrow Account pursuant to this
_Section 8.1.3_, the amount so deposited, a confirmation that such amount has
been paid into the Escrow Account and an identification of the
Indemnification Certificate that provides notice of the claim that is the
basis of the Buyers having exercised its rights in this _Section 8.1.3_. In
the event there is both an Unresolved Claim Amount and an Additional
Claim Amount that could be satisfied by an Escrow Account Addition, the
Escrow Account Addition shall first be applied to satisfy the Unresolved Claim
Amount and second to the Additional Claim Amount.

 

8.2 _Indemnification by the Buyer_.

8.2.1 _Indemnification_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article
8_ , the Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless each Equityholder and such
Equityholders respective Affiliates, and the Representatives and Affiliates

"), from, against and in respect of any and all Losses, whether or not
involving a Third Party Claim incurred or suffered by the Equityholder

relating to this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions. The aggregate
amount of Losses for which the Equityholder Indemnified Persons may be

Indemnified Person) or the Stockholders Representatives (on behalf of any

reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the amount so
stated, the date each such item was incurred or suffered, and the basis for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ (e.g. the nature of the

---|--- 

\- 82   the Buyer, as applicable, that the Indemnified Party is entitled to the full
amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification Certificate.
In the absence of a timely objection by the Stockholders Representatives,
the Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives agree to provide the
certificate required by Section 5(a) of the Escrow Agreement instructing the
Escrow Agent to distribute the full amount of the Losses claimed in the
Indemnification Certificate to the Buyer pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement and the Escrow Agent shall release the amount of such Losses to the
Buyer. Any notice of objection shall include a reasonably
detailed description of the preliminary basis for objecting to the claim or
claims set forth in the Indemnification Certificate In case the Indemnifying
Party shall object in writing to any claim or claims made in any
Indemnification Certificate to recover Losses within the thirty Business Day
period set forth above, the Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives shall
attempt to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims. If the Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth any agreement reached by them with
respect to such claim shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the
case of a claim in which the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnified Person,
such memorandum together with the certificate required by Section 5(a) of the
Escrow Agreement shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent and any payments to
the Buyer required thereby, if any, shall be made pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement. If the Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives are
not able to so agree within 20 calendar days following the delivery of the
notice of objection, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party (including the Equityholder Indemnified Persons individually) shall
each have the right to submit such dispute to a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of _Section 10.11_. At the
conclusion of such dispute, if Losses are payable to a Buyer Indemnified
Party, the parties shall submit the documentation required by Section 5(a) of
the Escrow Agreement to the Escrow Agent.

8.6 _Third Party Claims_.

8.6.1 _Notice of Claim_. If any third party asserts a claim against a Buyer
Indemnified Person or Equityholder Indemnified Person with respect to any
matter (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which is reasonably expected to give rise
to an indemnification claim under this _Article 8_ , then the Indemnified
Party will promptly give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in
notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
obligation under this _Article 8_ , except to the extent such delay actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall include a description in
reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified Party) of the facts
constituting the basis for such Third Party claim and the amount of the Losses
claimed.

8.6.2  _Assumption of Defense, etc_. The Indemnifying Party will be entitled
to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim that is the subject of

of the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party so long as (a) the
Indemnifying Party gives written notice to the Indemnified Party within
thirty days after the Indemnified Party has received notice of the Third Party
Claim that any Losses arising from, relating to, or caused

\- 83   by the Third Party Claim shall be considered indemnifiable Losses (it being
understood that any indemnification claim for such Losses shall nevertheless
be subject to the limitations in  _Section 8.1.2_, to the extent
applicable), (b) Buyer, in its good faith judgment, determines that the amount
in controversy and other Losses reasonably expected to result from the Third
Party Claim [*]; (c) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party
with reasonable evidence that the Indemnifying Party (which, where the
Indemnifying Party is the Equityholders, shall mean the Equityholders) would
reasonably be expected to have adequate financial resources to defend against
the Third Party Claim, (d) the Third Party Claim involves only money damages
and does not seek any injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party, (e) the Indemnified Party has not been advised by
outside counsel that an actual or potential conflict exists between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of
the Third Party Claim, (f) the Third Party Claim does not relate to or
otherwise arise in connection with any criminal or regulatory enforcement
Action, (g) the Third Party Claim does not involve the ownership, scope or
validity of a Taligen Patent or other Intellectual Property material to the
business at the time of such Third Party Claim, and (h) the Indemnifying
Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.
The Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and
expense and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim;  _provided_
, _however_ , that the fees and expenses of a single separate co-counsel
retained by the Indemnified Party that are incurred prior to Indemnifying
Partys assumption of control of the defense of the Third Party Claim shall
be considered Losses for purposes of this _Article 8_.

8.6.3 _Limitations on Settlements_. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with
respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) unless such judgment, compromise or settlement (a)
provides for the payment by the Indemnifying Party of money as sole relief for
the claimant, (b) results in the full release of the Indemnified Parties
(which, in the case where the Indemnified Parties are Equityholder
Indemnified Persons, shall mean the Equityholder Indemnified Persons
individually) who were parties to such Third Party Claim from all liabilities
arising out of, relating to or in connection with, such Third Party Claim and
(c) involves no finding or admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or
the legal rights of any Person who is not a party to such judgment, compromise
or settlement and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the
Indemnified Party (which, in the case where the Indemnified Parties are
Equityholder Indemnified Persons, shall mean the Equityholder Indemnified
Persons individually). The Indemnified Party shall not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any compromise or settlement with respect to a
Third Party Claim, in each case other than an Excluded Settlement, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Indemnified Party is a
Buyer Indemnified Person, such Indemnified Person may consent to the entry of
judgment or enter into compromises or settlements with respect to Third Party
Claims without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party if the
amount of such compromise or settlement [*] (it being understood that the
Stockholders Representatives shall nevertheless have the right to contest
whether the Buyer Indemnified Persons are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.1.1_ for Losses incurred or suffered by Buyer
Indemnified Persons in connection with such Excluded Settlement).

\- 84  8.6.4 _Indemnified Party s Control_. If the Indemnifying Party (i) does
not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with _Section
8.6.2_ within thirty (30) days after the Indemnified Party has given notice of
such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not provide the evidence required by
clause (c) of _Section 8.6.2, (iii)_ is otherwise unable to assume the
defense or (iv) at any time fails to conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently (after notice and a reasonable opportunity to
cure such failure), the Indemnified Party may defend such Third Party Claim
with counsel of its choice in each jurisdiction where there is a controversy
(provided that the Indemnified Party may only seek indemnification pursuant
to  _Section 8.1_ hereof for the costs, fees, and expenses of one counsel
for all Indemnified Parties unless an actual conflict exists which prevents
one counsel from representing all Indemnified Parties). In such case (i) the
Indemnified Party shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably advised of the
status of such Third Party Claim and the defense thereof and shall consider
recommendations made by the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto and (ii)
except in the case of Third Party Claims described in clauses (e), (f) and
(g) of _Section 8.6.2_, the Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-counsel
at its sole cost and expense, participate in the defense of the Third Party
Claim and, to the extent the Third Party Claim constitutes an Action, appear
in such Action (it being understood that in any event, the Indemnified Party
shall in the case make the ultimate decision with respect to all aspects of
the defense of such Third Party Claim). The Indemnified Party shall not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any compromise or
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim, in each case other than an
Excluded Settlement, without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

8.6.5 _Consent to Jurisdiction Regarding Third Party Claim_. The Buyer and
each of the Stockholders, each in its capacity as an Indemnifying Party,
hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which any
Third Party Claim may be brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes
of any claim which such Indemnified Party may have against such Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Agreement in connection with such Third Party Claim,
and in furtherance thereof, the provisions of  _Section 10.11_ are
incorporated herein by reference, mutatis mutandis.

8.7 _No Circular Recovery_. Each Equityholder hereby agrees that it will not
make any claim for indemnification against the Buyer or the Company by reason
of the fact that such Equityholder was a controlling person, director,
employee or Representative of the Company or was serving as such for another
Person at the request of the Buyer or the Company (whether such claim is for
Losses of any kind or otherwise and whether such claim is pursuant to any
statute, Organizational Document, Contractual Obligation or otherwise)
with respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against any
Equityholder relating to this Agreement or any of the Contemplated
Transactions or the facts and circumstances underlying such claim. With
respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Person against any
Equityholder relating to this Agreement and any of the Contemplated
Transactions, each Equityholder expressly waives any right of subrogation,
contribution, advancement, indemnification or other claim against the Company
with respect to any amounts owed by such Equityholder (including by virtue of
a payment out of the Escrow Account) pursuant to this _Article 8_.

\- 85  8.8 _Punitive Damages; Insurance_.

 

(a) In no event shall any Indemnifying Party be responsible or liable for any
Losses under this _Article 8_ that are special, incidental or punitive or
otherwise not actual damages, unless incurred or suffered in connection with a
Third Party Claim.

 

(b) The amount of actual Losses recovered by a Indemnified Party under this
_Article 8_ with respect to an Indemnity Claim shall be reduced by the amount
of any insurance payment actually received by such Indemnified Party (or an
Affiliate thereof) that is directly attributable to such claim; _provided_
that, the decision to seek recovery under an insurance policy shall be in the
sole discretion of the Indemnified Party and nothing in this _Section 8.8(b)_
shall impose an obligation on the Indemnified Party to seek such recovery. If
an Indemnified Party (or an Affiliate thereof) receives any insurance payment
in connection with any claim for Losses for which it has already been
indemnified, the Indemnifying Party shall be reimbursed by an amount equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount previously received by the Indemnified Party
under this  _Article 8_ with respect to such claim or (ii) the amount of such
insurance payment; _provided_ that, if the Indemnity Claim was made by a Buyer
Indemnified Person, (x) if the reimbursement is to be paid prior to the
Escrow Termination Date , it shall be paid to the Escrow Account to be held
in the Escrow Account, (y) if the reimbursement is to be paid after the Escrow
Termination Date and at the time of such reimbursement the Excess Claim Amount
exceeds the amount the held in the Escrow Account, then the amount of such
excess (or, if such reimbursement is less than the amount of such excess, the
amount of such reimbursement) shall be paid to the Escrow Agent to be held in
the Escrow Account, and Buyer shall pay any remaining amount of such
reimbursement to the Equityholders and (z) if the reimbursement is to be paid
after the Escrow Termination Date and at the time of such reimbursement the
aggregate amount of Losses covered by Unresolved Indemnification Certificates
(as defined in the Escrow Agreement) does not exceed Excess Claim Amount, then
Buyer shall pay the amount of such reimbursement to the Equityholders.

 

8.9 _Treatment of Payments_. Each Party agrees to treat all payments made by
it to or for the benefit of another Party under indemnity provisions of this
Agreement as adjustments to the Series Bl Call Purchase Price set forth on
_Exhibit D_ and the merger consideration paid in connection with the Merger
or, as applicable, as capital contributions for Tax purposes, and such
treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the extent that the Legal
Requirements of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise.

8.10 _References_. For purposes of this _Article 8_ , (i) if the Equityholders
comprise the Indemnifying Party, any references to the Indemnifying Party
(except provisions relating to an obligation to make any payments) shall be
deemed to refer to the Stockholders Representatives and (ii) if the
Equityholders comprise the Indemnified Party, any references to the
Indemnified Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make or a
right to receive any payments, the amount of Losses suffered by Indemnified
Parties or the amount of any insurance payments received by Indemnified
Parties) shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholders Representatives.

\- 86  8.11 _Excluded Termination Claims_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, no Buyer Indemnified Person may seek indemnification from an
Indemnifying Party for any Losses resulting directly from a Third Party Claim
by an employee who was an employee of the Company prior to the Effective Date
that any termination of such employee after the Effective Date was illegal.
For the avoidance of doubt, the excluded claims described in this _Section
8.11_ will be limited to claims that a termination of employment was illegal
and events not directly related to the termination will not be excluded
pursuant to this _Section 8.11_ and will be subject to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 8_.

ARTICLE 9

TAX MATTERS

 

9.1 _Returns_. All Tax Returns of the Company due after the Closing Date for
taxable periods that end prior to or that include the Closing Date ("
_Company Returns_ ") shall be prepared, and each item thereon treated, in a
manner consistent with past practices and treatment insofar as related to the
Company unless the Buyer determines that there is no reasonable basis for
such position, and shall be true, correct and complete in all material
respects. No later than thirty days prior to the due date for filing a Company
Return, the Buyer shall cause the Company to provide the
Stockholders Representatives with a copy of such Tax Return. The
Stockholders Representatives shall be entitled to comment on any item in such
Company Return to the extent it relates to any Tax period that began on or
before the Closing Date and such items are attributable to the portion of the
Tax period that ended on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Tax
Period_ "). The Company shall accept such comments by the Stockholders
Representatives; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the Company shall not be obligated
to accept any comments if the Buyer reasonably determines that (i) the
position advocated by the Stockholders Representatives will adversely impact
any taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing or (ii)
the position advocated by the Stockholders Representatives more likely than
not is not correct. The Company shall make such changes to the Company Return
as the Stockholders and Buyer may reasonably request.

9.2 _Straddle Period_. In the case of any Tax period that includes (but does
not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any
withholding Taxes and any Taxes of the Company based upon or measured by net
income or gain for the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be determined based on an
interim closing of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(and for such purpose, the Tax period of any partnership or other pass-through
entity in which either Company holds a beneficial interest will be deemed to
terminate at such time). The amount of Taxes, other than withholding Taxes
and Taxes of the Company based upon or measured by net income or gain for a
Straddle Period, which relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
---|--- 

\- 87  9.3 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar agreements
and all powers of attorney with respect to or involving the Company will be
terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing, the Company will
not be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

 

9.4 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and any conveyance fees or recording
charges incurred in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, will be
paid by the Buyer when due and the Buyer shall be entitled to withdraw from
the Escrow Account 50% of such costs (to the extent such funds are available
in the Escrow Account). The Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges and, if
required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Equityholders will (and will
cause their Affiliates to) join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and
other documentation. The Buyer shall be entitled to withdraw from the Escrow
Account 50% of any expenses incurred by the Buyer in connection with such
filings (to the extent such funds are available in the Escrow Account).

9.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Buyer, the Company and the Stockholders
will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
Party, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Company. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other Partys request)
the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such Tax matter. The Buyer shall cause the Company (a) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the
statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (b) to
give the Stockholders Representatives reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
Stockholders Representatives so request, the Company shall allow the
Stockholders Representatives to take possession of such books and records.
The Stockholders further agree, upon request, to provide the Buyer with all
information that the Buyer determines to be required to report pursuant to
Code Section 6043A to the extent the Buyer does not otherwise have access to
such information.

9.6 _Tax Disclosure_. The Buyer, the Equityholders, the Company, and
their respective representatives may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and all materials of any kind
(including opinions or other tax analyses) that relating to such tax
treatment and tax structure, all as contemplated by Treasury Regulations
Section 1.601 l-4(b)(3)(iii).

each of the other Parties hereto.

10.2 _Succession and Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiary_. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, each of which such successors and permitted assigns will be
deemed to be a party hereto for all purposes hereof. Other than Permitted
Transfers of the right to receive Milestone Payments, no Party may assign,

interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the
Buyer and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may (a) assign
any or all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its
Affiliates and (b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its
obligations hereunder; _provided_ that in each case, Buyer shall
remain primarily liable for all of its obligations and Liabilities hereunder.
Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties and their permitted successors and assignees and nothing herein
expressed or implied will give or be construed to give any Person, other than

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Stockholders Representatives shall be
entitled, on behalf of the Equityholders, to enforce this Agreement pursuant

\- 90  10.3 _Amendments and Waivers_. No amendment or waiver of any provision of
this Agreement will be valid and binding unless it is in writing and signed,
in the case of an amendment, by Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives or
in the case of a waiver, by the Party (in the case of the Equityholders,
the Stockholders Representative) against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No waiver by any Party of any breach or violation or, default under or
inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant hereunder, whether
intentional or not, will be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent
breach, violation, default of, or inaccuracy in, any such representation,
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No delay or omission on
the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or remedy under this
Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof.

10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the other Ancillary
Agreements and any documents, instruments and certificates explicitly referred
to herein, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior discussions,
negotiations, proposals, undertakings, understandings and agreements, whether
written or oral, with respect thereto.

 

10.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement will
become effective when duly executed by each Party hereto.

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. In the event that any provision hereof
would, under applicable Legal Requirements, be invalid or unenforceable in
any respect, each Party hereto intends that such provision will be construed
by modifying or limiting it so as to be valid and Enforceable to the maximum
extent compatible with, and possible under, applicable Legal Requirements. 

10.7 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience
purposes only and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation
hereof.

10.8 _Construction_. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each representation,
warranty and covenant contained herein will have independent significance. If
any Party has breached or violated, or if there is an inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any respect, the fact
that there exists another representation, warranty or covenant relating to the
same subject matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which
the Party has not breached or violated, or in respect of which there is not an
inaccuracy, will not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party has
breached or violated, or there is an inaccuracy in, the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

integral part of this Agreement. All schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference and all references herein
to this "Agreement" shall mean this Agreement together with all such schedules
and exhibits. Certain sections of the Disclosure Schedule contain disclosures
which include more information than is required by the sections of the
Agreement to which such sections relate and such additional disclosure shall
not be deemed to mean that such information is required by such related
sections of the Agreement (for example, the fact that a section of the
Agreement calls for a listing of material agreements does not necessarily mean
that such agreement listed on the related section of the Disclosure Schedule
is material). Headings have been inserted on the sections of the Disclosure
Schedule for convenience of reference only and shall to no extent have the
effect of amending or changing the express description of the sections of
the Disclosure Schedule as set forth in this Agreement. Any matter disclosed
in any section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be included in
all sections of the Disclosure Schedule to which such matter reasonably
relates, but only to the extent such relationship is reasonably apparent on
the face of such disclosure.

10.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights of the Parties and all
Actions arising in whole or in part under or in connection herewith, will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the domestic substantive laws of
The State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law
provision or rule that would cause the application of the laws of any other
jurisdiction.

10.11.1 _Jurisdiction_. Each Party to this Agreement, by its
execution hereof, (a) hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive personal

County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting
in Wilmington, Delaware, for the purpose of any Action between the Parties
arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, (b)
hereby waives to the extent not prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any
such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that any such Action brought in one of the above-
named courts should be dismissed on grounds of forum non conveniens, should be
transferred or removed to any court other than one of the above-named courts,
or should be stayed by reason of the pendency of some other proceeding in
any other court other than one of the above-named courts, or that this
Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not be enforced in or by such court
and (c) hereby agrees not to commence any such Action other than before one of
the above-named courts. Notwithstanding the previous sentence a Party may
commence any Action in a court other than the above-named courts solely for
the purpose of enforcing an order or judgment issued by one of the above-named
courts.

arising in whole or in part under or in connection with this Agreement, such

process in any Action between the Parties arising in whole or in part under
or in connection with this Agreement in any manner permitted by Delaware law,
(b) agrees that service of process made in accordance with clause (a) of
this  _Section 10.11.3_ or made by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, at its address specified pursuant to _Section 10.1_, will
constitute good and valid service of process in any such Action and (c)
waives and agrees not to assert (by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise)
in any such Action any claim that service of process made in accordance with
clause (a) or (b) of this _Section 10.11.3_ does not constitute good and
valid service of process.

10.12 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the
Parties agrees that, without posting bond or other undertaking, the other
Parties will be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches or violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in addition
to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.

10.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW
THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE, AND COVENANT THAT THEY WILL
NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE), ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING
OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR
AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF
THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS.

STOCKHOLDER CONSENT, AGREEMENT AND RELEASE

THIS CONSENT, AGREEMENT AND RELEASE (this " _Agreement and Release_ "), is
made as of January , 2011, between Taligen Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and the undersigned stockholder of the
Company (the " _Stockholder Party_ ").

WHEREAS, on or about the date hereof (x) the Company is entering into
an agreement and plan of Merger with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), TPCA Corporation (the " _MergerSub_
"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer,
the Series B1 Call Right Seller (as defined therein) and only for certain
limited purposes described therein, Nick Galakatos, Ed Hurwitz and Timothy
Mills, as Stockholders Representatives (the " _Stockholders
 Representatives_"), in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), (y) the Company is approving a plan pursuant to which
all of the Company Options will be terminated and payments will be made to
certain plan participants (the " _Carve Out Plan_ ") and (z) the Company is
entering into certain other agreements and executing certain other documents
related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
Carve Out Plan.

WHEREAS, the Stockholder Party will be the beneficiary of cash proceeds in the
Merger, in consideration of its shares of Company Common Stock, Preferred
Stock, Company Warrants, Company Options and/or the assignment of Series B1
Call Rights (collectively, Company Common Stock, Preferred Stock, Company
Warrants and Series B1 Call Rights, the " _Equity Rights_ ") to Buyer
pursuant to the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides that at Closing [*] to be paid to the
Equityholders will be placed into escrow in order to provide security for
certain post-closing claims and adjustments to the Companys existing cash
balances on the Closing Date and to pay certain expenses of the Buyer and
the Stockholders Representatives ([*], together with any additional funds
deposited after the Closing, the " _Escrow Fund_ "). In the event Milestone
Payments are paid under the Merger Agreement, a portion of those payments may
be payable into the Escrow Fund for satisfaction of these claims and
expenses. The consideration placed in the Escrow Fund will be held for [*] and
then, to the extent it has not been used to pay for adjustments, claims or
expenses, and subject to holdback for the amount at issue in any pending
claims, will be released to the Companys Equityholders (including a

Representatives or any such Equityholder).

(f) No Duty to Calculate or Confirm. In any case hereunder in which the
Escrow Agent is to receive instructions to release, the Escrow Agent shall be

credit issued by any commercial bank satisfying the requirements of clause
(ii) of this definition; (vii) deposits in any commercial bank satisfying the

Absent receipt of specific joint written investment instructions executed by
Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives, the Escrow Agent will invest the
Escrow Fund in the Wells Fargo Institutional Money Market Deposit Account
("IMMA") certain aspects of which are described on  _Attachment C_ hereto.
The Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives acknowledge that they have
read and understand _Attachment C_. The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to
execute purchases and sales of investments through the facilities of its own
trading or capital markets operations or those of any affiliated entity. The
Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with respect to
any Permitted Investment directed hereunder including without limitation
charging any applicable agency fee in connection with each transaction. The
Stockholders Representatives and Buyer recognize and agree that the Escrow
Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to
either the investment of moneys held in the Escrow Account or the purchase,
sale, retention or other disposition of any investment described herein. The
Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any investment losses, including
without limitation any market loss on any investment liquidated prior to
maturity in order to make a payment required hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall
have the right to liquidate investments as necessary to distribute the Escrow
Account pursuant to Section 5 above. 

(b) _Tax Reporting_. All interest and other income or capital gains earned
from the investment of the Escrow Account shall be allocated and reported to
Buyer for tax purposes, and the Escrow Agent shall report such interest and
other income consistently thereunder to the Internal Revenue Service and any
other taxing authority on the IRS Form 1099 or 1042S (or other appropriate
form) as income earned from the Escrow Account whether or not said income has
been distributed during such year. Each of Buyer, Stockholders
Representatives and the Equityholders, to the extent required by law, shall
provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax identification number by
signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8, in the case of non-U.S.
persons) to the Escrow Agent. In the absence of proper documentation, the
Escrow Agent shall withhold and remit taxes to the IRS, or any other taxing
authority as required by law. Buyer understands that, in the event its tax
identification number is not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a
portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow
Account. For each year, (i) the Escrow Agent shall upon written request
distribute to Buyer [*] of all income earned from the investments of
the Escrow Account (each, a "Tax Distribution"), provided that

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Buyer shall receive a Tax Distribution no later than five (5) business days
before Buyer is required to file each corresponding estimated and final tax
return with respect to such income; and (ii) the parties hereto agree to
cooperate, and to act, in good faith and reasonably in the execution of Tax
Distributions to Buyer.

7\. _Monthly Reports_. The Escrow Agent shall, promptly following the end of
each calendar month, provide monthly statements to Buyer and the Stockholders
Representatives with respect to the Escrow Account.

8\. _Fees and Expenses_. Buyer and the Stockholders Representatives, on
behalf of the Equityholders, shall (a) pay the fees of the Escrow Agent for
the services to be rendered by the Escrow Agent hereunder, which are set forth
on Attachment B hereto, and (b) reimburse the Escrow Agent for its reasonable
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the performance of its duties under this Escrow Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall bill Buyer for [*] of all such amounts and shall deduct the
remaining [*] of all such amounts from the Escrow Account. If any amount due
to the Escrow Agent hereunder is not paid within [*] days of the date due, the
Escrow Agent in its sole discretion may charge interest on such amount up to
the highest rate permitted by applicable law. The Escrow Agent shall have,
and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon the Escrow Account with respect to
its unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification
rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or entities and
is hereby granted the right to set off and deduct any unpaid fees, non-
reimbursed expenses and unsatisfied indemnification rights from the Escrow
Account.

9\. _Disagreements_. If any conflict, disagreement or dispute arises between,
among, or involving any of the parties hereto concerning the meaning or
validity of any provision hereunder or concerning any other matter relating
to this Escrow Agreement, or the Escrow Agent is in doubt as to the action to
be taken hereunder, the Escrow Agent may, at its option, retain the Escrow
Account until the Escrow Agent (i) receives a final non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or a final non-appealable arbitration decision
directing delivery of the Escrow Account, (ii) receives a written agreement
executed by each of the parties involved in such disagreement or dispute
directing delivery of the Escrow Account, in which event the Escrow Agent
shall be authorized to disburse the Escrow Account in accordance with such
final court order, arbitration decision, or agreement, or (iii) files
an interpleader action in any court of competent jurisdiction, and upon the
filing thereof, the Escrow Agent shall be relieved of all liability as to the
Escrow Account and shall be entitled to recover attorneys fees, expenses and
other costs incurred in commencing and maintaining any such interpleader
action. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act on any such agreement, court
order, or arbitration decision without further question, inquiry, or consent.

 

10\. _Limitation of Escrow Agent s Liability_.

(a) _Limitation on Liability_. The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties
as are specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed
purely ministerial in nature, and no other duties shall be implied. Under no
circumstances will the Escrow Agent be

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  deemed to be a fiduciary to any Party or any other person under this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable
with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and
conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the parties,
in connection herewith, if any, including without limitation the Merger
Agreement, nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any person
or entity has complied with the Merger Agreement, nor shall any additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of the Merger
Agreement, even though reference thereto may be made in this Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability with respect to any
action taken or suffered by it in reliance upon any notice, direction,
instruction, consent, statement or other documents believed by it to be
genuine and duly authorized, nor for any other action or inaction, except its
own willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Escrow Agent shall not be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of this Escrow Agreement or any
other agreement referred to herein. In all questions arising under the Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely on the advice of counsel, and the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in
good faith by the Escrow Agent based on such advice. The Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Escrow Account
nor shall the Escrow Agent have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify
the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited with it hereunder. The
parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in connection with any dispute
without making the Escrow Agent a party to the same. Notwithstanding anything
in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the Escrow Agent
be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect or consequential loss
or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits),
even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or
damage and regardless of the form of action.

(b) _Indemnification_. The Stockholders Representatives, on behalf of the
Equityholders, and Buyer, shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective
successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the "Indemnitees") from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties,
judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses of outside
counsel and experts and their staffs) (collectively "Losses") arising out of
or in connection with (i) the Escrow Agents execution and performance of this
Escrow Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights
or remedies under or in connection with this Escrow Agreement, or as may
arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the Indemnitee or (ii) its
following any instructions or directions, except in either case to the extent
that such Losses are caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Indemnitee. Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholders
Representatives, on behalf of the Equityholders, on the other hand, shall each
be liable for one-half of any such amounts. The indemnity obligations set
forth in this Section 9(b) shall survive the resignation, replacement or
removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Escrow Agreement.

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential

has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 11\. _Liability and Authority of Stockholders  Representatives;
Successors_. 

(a) _Power and Authority_. The Stockholders Representatives, acting jointly
but not singly, shall have full power and authority to represent the
Equityholders, and their successors, with respect to all matters arising under
this Escrow Agreement and all actions taken by the Stockholders
Representatives hereunder shall be binding upon the Equityholders, and their
successors, as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by each of them.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Stockholders
Representatives shall have full power and authority to interpret all of the
terms and provisions of this Escrow Agreement, to compromise any claims
asserted hereunder and to authorize payments to be made with respect thereto,
on behalf of the Equityholders and their successors.

 

(b) _Successor Stockholders  Representatives_. In the event that either or
both of the Stockholders Representatives is replaced pursuant to Section

Representatives shall be deemed to be the Stockholders Representatives for
all purposes of this Escrow Agreement.

 

(c) _Reliance by Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent may rely on the Stockholders
Representatives as the exclusive agents of the Equityholders under this
Escrow Agreement and shall incur no liability to any party with respect to any
action taken or suffered by it in reliance thereon. Concurrent with the
execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Buyer shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent authorized signor form, _Attachment D_ hereto.

12\. _Successor Escrow Agent_. In the event the Escrow Agent becomes
unavailable or unwilling to continue in its capacity herewith, the Escrow
Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by
delivering a resignation to the parties to this Escrow Agreement, not less
than 60 days prior to the date when such resignation shall take effect.
Similarly, the Escrow Agent may be removed and replaced following the giving
of 60 days prior written notice sent to the Escrow Agent and signed by the
Stockholders Representatives and Buyer. Buyer may appoint a successor Escrow
Agent with the consent of the Stockholders Representatives, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed so long as such successor is a
bank with assets of at least $1,000,000,000. If, within such notice period
(either for resignation or removal), Buyer provides to the Escrow Agent
written instructions with respect to the appointment of a successor Escrow
Agent and directions for the transfer of any Escrow Account then held by the
Escrow Agent to such successor, the Escrow Agent shall act in accordance with
such instructions and promptly transfer such Escrow Account, less any fees and
expenses due and payable to the Escrow Agent, to such designated successor.
If no successor Escrow Agent is named as provided in this Section 12 prior to
the date on which the resignation of the Escrow Agent is to properly take
effect, the Escrow Agent may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction
for appointment of a successor escrow agent. If the Escrow Agent does not
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
escrow agent, then the Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such sixty day
notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Account (without any
obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a successor escrow
agent, if and when such successor is designated in writing in the manner set
forth in the second sentence of this Section 12 or in accordance with the
directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,
at which time the Escrow Agents

_CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT_

CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the "Agreement"), dated as of January 28,
2011, between Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Alexion") and [RECEIVING PARTY] as Stockholders Representative (the
"Receiving Party").

 

WHEREAS, on January 28, 2011 (x) Alexion entered into an agreement and plan of
Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Taligen Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Taligen"), TPCA Corporation (the "MergerSub"), a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alexion, the Series B1 Call Right
Seller (as defined therein) and only for certain limited purposes described
therein, the Receiving Party and each of Nick Galakatos, Ed Hurwitz and
Timothy Mills (the "Stockholders Representatives"). Capitalized terms used
but not defined herein will have the meaning set forth in the Merger
Agreement.

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Alexion
will disclose the Other Confidential Information (as defined below) and the
Confidential Development Information (as defined below) to the Receiving Party
and the Receiving Party will hold the Confidential Information (as defined
below) strictly confidential as described below;

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 2.12.5(e) of the Merger Agreement, the Receiving
Party agreed to enter into this Agreement to govern the disclosure of the
Confidential Information;

WHEREAS, the Receiving Party is entering into this Agreement pursuant to his
duties as Stockholders Representative under the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, each of Timothy Mills and Nick Galakatos will enter into
confidentiality agreements with Alexion on the date hereof governing the
disclosure of Confidential Information (each, a "Stockholder Representative
Confidentiality Agreement"); and 

WHEREAS, Alexion and the Receiving Party acknowledge and agree that the
execution and delivery of this Agreement is a condition to the disclosure of
any Confidential Information and that Alexion will rely upon this Agreement in
disclosing any such Confidential Information.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the covenants set forth
below and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and legal
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby enter
into this Agreement, the terms of which are as follows:

1\. Alexion shall disclose, or shall cause to be disclosed, the Confidential
Information required by Section 2.12.5 of the Merger Agreement, including
without limitation (x) the Initial Limited Partner Disclosure (as defined
below) and (y) the reports provided pursuant to Section 2.12.5(e) (such
information, collectively the "Confidential Development Information") to the
Stockholders Representatives in their capacities as such in accordance with
the Merger Agreement, and the Receiving Party shall accept and hold the
Initial Limited Partner Disclosure and the Confidential Development
Information in confidence in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 3
hereof.

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 2\. In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company may from time to time
disclose or cause to be disclosed certain confidential information relating
to Alexion, Merger Sub or Taligen to the Receiving Party in addition to the
Confidential Development Information (such additional information, the "Other
Confidential Information" and, together with the Initial Limited Partner
Disclosure and the Confidential Development Information, the "Confidential
Information"). The Receiving Party shall accept and hold the Other
Confidential Information in confidence in accordance with the provisions of
Paragraph 3 hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, any Other Confidential
Information that constitutes both Other Confidential Information and either
Initial Limited Partner Disclosure or Confidential Development Information
will be treated as Initial Limited Partner Disclosure or Confidential
Development Information, as applicable, hereunder.

3\. The Receiving Party agrees (x) to maintain the Confidential Information in
strict confidence and (y) except as provided in paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7
hereof, not to disclose to any third party any or all of the Confidential
Information, or permit any third party to have access to such Confidential
Information. The Receiving Party agrees not to use the Confidential
Development Information for any purpose other than (i) in connection with the
preparation of the Estimated Future Payment Information (as defined below) and
distribute this information to the Permitted Receiving Parties in accordance
with paragraph 6 hereof or (ii) to the enforcement of Section 2.12 or Article
8 of the Merger Agreement or the breach of any other provision thereof. The
Receiving Party agrees to use the Other Confidential Information solely in
connection with fulfilling the duties of the Stockholders
Representative contemplated by Section 2.13 of the Merger Agreement. The
permitted uses of the Confidential Development Information and the Other
Confidential Information described in the preceding two sentences are
hereinafter referred to as the "Applicable Business Purpose". Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall not, during
the period ending 30 days after the date of this Agreement, make any public
disclosure with respect to the subject matter of the Merger Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions (as defined in the Merger Agreement), including the
financial terms and conditions, without the prior written consent of Alexion,
except that the Receiving Party may (i) provide the Initial Limited Partner
Disclosure and the press release attached to the Merger Agreement as Exhibit L
to the Permitted Receiving Parties, (ii) in response to inquiries or questions
from members of the media or other Person with respect to such subject matter
or the Contemplated Transactions, provide to such member of the media or other
Person a written response in the form of Exhibit K to the Merger Agreement,
and (iii) continue to use, display and distribute any printed materials that
were printed on or prior to the day immediately preceding the date hereof,
provided (a) such materials are used, displayed and distributed in the
ordinary course of the Receiving Partys business, (b) in the case of (iv)
and (v) such content and materials do not mention or refer to the Contemplated
Transactions or Alexion and (c) any such content that can only be accessed
with a password prior to the date hereof remain password protected. For
the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions in this Paragraph 3 apply to
Receiving Party in his capacity as a Stockholders Representative, and do not
restrict any venture capital fund of which Receiving Party is an employee or
partner and that has signed the Permitted Party Confidentiality Agreement (it
being understood that such venture capital funds are restricted by the terms
of the Permitted Party Confidentiality Agreement).

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 4\. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information that is required
to be disclosed by law, but only to the extent necessary to comply with law,
if, prior to making such disclosure, the Receiving Party promptly notifies
Alexion in writing of such disclosure, unless it would be a violation of law
to provide such prior notice and, to the extent legally permissible, will use
reasonable best efforts to seek, and cooperates with Alexion in seeking, a
protective order or other confidential treatment of the Confidential
Information in a manner consistent with applicable law. All notices provided
pursuant to the preceding sentence will describe the legal requirement
pursuant to which disclosure is required and the extent of the required
disclosure.

 

5\. Except as provided in Section 10 hereof, the Receiving Party may disclose
the Confidential Information to legal counsel (collectively, the Receiving
Partys "Legal Counsel") and other advisors (collectively, the Receiving
Partys "Other Advisors" and, together with Legal Counsel, the "Advisors") who
have a _bona fide_ need to know the Confidential Information in order to
perform an Applicable Business Purpose, but only to the extent necessary or
appropriate to perform such Applicable Business Purpose. The Receiving Party
agrees that it will only disclose Confidential Information in accordance with
the preceding sentence to Advisors after the Receiving Party has formally
engaged such Advisors and, (x) in the case of Legal Counsel, confirmed the
receipt of such Confidential Information by such legal counsel would not
result in a legal or ethical conflict, (y) in the case of auditors, confirmed
such auditors are bound by confidentiality obligations pursuant to which such
auditors will keep such information strictly confidential and (y) in the case
of Other Advisors who are not auditors, such advisors shall have signed a
confidentiality with Alexion in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 3. The Receiving Party will not waive Legal Counsels or auditors
obligation to keep the Confidential Information confidential without the
prior written consent of Alexion, except that consent will not be required in
the case of disclosure of Confidential Information to enforce Section 2.12 or
Section 8 of the Merger Agreement. The Receiving Party shall disclose to
Alexion the names of any Advisors to whom it intends to provide Confidential
Information prior to disclosing any Confidential Information.

 

6\. The Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information to any
person listed on Exhibit 1 hereto (collectively, the "VC Fund(s)") who has
signed a confidentiality agreement (each such agreement, a "Permitted Party
Confidentiality Agreement") with Alexion in the form attached as Exhibit 2
hereto (collectively, the "Permitted Receiving Parties") prior to the
disclosure of any Confidential Information. The Permitted Receiving Parties
will be precluded from further disclosure and use of Confidential Information
pursuant to such Permitted Party Confidentiality Agreements, except in
accordance with the terms of such Permitted Party Confidentiality Agreement
and except that each Permitted Receiving Party will be entitled to provide (x)
the Initial Limited Partner Disclosure to its limited partners and Prospective
Limited Partners (as defined below) and (y) the Estimated Future Payment
Information (as defined below) to its limited partners and Prospective Limited
Partners, in the case of (x) and (y) which limited partners and Prospective
Limited Partners are bound by a written obligation of confidentiality with
respect to such Initial Limited Partner Disclosure and Estimated Future
Payment Information which obligates such limited partner to keep such Initial
Limited Partner 

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Disclosure and Estimated Future Payment Information confidential in the same
manner as other highly confidential information disclosed to the limited
partner by the Permitted Receiving Party. The Permitted Party Confidentiality
Agreement requires the Permitted Receiving Party to covenant and agree to
strictly enforce the Permitted Party Confidentiality Agreement (and not waive
confidentiality or disclosure prohibitions) with respect to the Initial
Limited Partner Disclosure or the Estimated Future Payment Information without
the prior written consent of Alexion. For purposes of this Agreement, "Initial
Limited Partner Disclosure" means the information set forth on Exhibit I to
the Merger Agreement and "Estimated Future Payment Information" means reports
limited to the form and information on the attached Exhibit 4, which provides
an estimate by a VC Fund of the dollar amount of the Milestone Payments to
be paid in the successive two year periods following the Closing. For the
avoidance of doubt, such Estimated Future Payment Information shall not
include any description of the Milestones, the conditions for achieving the
Milestones, the Milestone Payments or any other information required to be
kept confidential pursuant to such Permitted Party Confidentiality Agreement.
In no circumstances shall the Estimated Future Payment Information include or
attach the reports provided by or on behalf of Alexion. Each Permitted
Receiving Party shall provide Alexion for review one Business Day prior to the
intended date of distribution a copy of any Estimated Future Payment
Information proposed to be provided to such Permitted Receiving Partys
limited partners and Prospective Limited Partners, unless such Estimated
Future Payment Information is unchanged from the prior disclosure of Estimated
Future Payment Information to such Permitted Receiving Partys limited
partners and Prospective Limited Partners. For purposes of this provision,
"Prospective Limited Partners" shall mean potential investors or limited
partners in the venture capital fund or funds which are invested directly or
indirectly in Taligen. 

7\. The restrictions in this Agreement shall not apply to any disclosure by
any Receiving Party or any Permitted Receiving Party of any Confidential
Information which is in the public domain at the time of disclosure hereunder
or which subsequently comes within the public domain through no fault of or
act or omission by the Receiving Party.

 

8\. All Confidential Information shall remain the sole and exclusive property
of Alexion. No right or license, either express or implied, with respect to
the Confidential Information or with any intellectual property or proprietary
rights of Alexion will be granted hereunder by Alexion to the Receiving Party.

9\. This Agreement and the Merger Agreement contains all the representations
and agreements between the parties relating to the Confidential Information
and any representation, promise or condition concerning the same which is not
contained herein, therein, or in a superseding written agreement referring to
this Agreement shall not be binding on either party hereto.

10\. Each party acknowledges and agrees that the unauthorized use or
disclosure of any Confidential Information would cause Alexion to incur
irreparable harm and significant damages, the degree of which will be
difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, each party agrees that Alexion will have
the right to equitable relief (including injunction and specific performance)
as a remedy for any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this
Agreement, in addition to

 



   * | Omitted information is the subject of a request for confidential
treatment pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  any other rights and remedies that it may have at law or otherwise. Each
party further acknowledges and agrees that Alexion shall not be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this paragraph 10, and
waives any right it may have to require that Alexion obtain, furnish or post

Our firm is proud to have supported the establishment and growth of Taligen
Therapeutics. We are very happy with this outcome, which can greatly benefit
patients with severe disorders in the years ahead.

Over the years, Taligen has assembled an exceptional team of biotech
researchers who have innovated a portfolio of promising early-stage products.
Given Taligens resources and Alexions history of successful drug
innovation, development and commercialization, we believe that the combination
of these teams will accelerate the development of additional first-in-class
therapies for patients with severe diseases, including those in which
the complement system plays a role.

In particular, we are enthusiastic about the potential for Taligens product
candidates to provide meaningful benefits for patients with ophthalmic
disorders. Alexion is perfectly placed to advance these ophthalmology
programs.

We look forward to seeing the combined teams develop product candidates from
their existing portfolios and innovate new therapies in ophthalmology,
nephrology, hematology and other fields.

For more information on Alexions acquisition of Taligen, please contact
Irving Adler at Alexions headquarters in Connecticut: [*] (mobile),

Alexion Acquires Taligen Therapeutics and Creates Translational

Medicine Group to Accelerate Development of Expanded Portfolio

CHESHIRE, Conn.(BUSINESS WIRE)Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that
it has acquired Taligen Therapeutics, Inc., a privately held development-stage
biotechnology company based in Cambridge, Mass. The acquisition broadens
Alexions portfolio of product candidates and expands Alexions capabilities
in translational medicine by bringing additional accomplished researchers to
the Company. Alexion gains promising pre-clinical compounds, including
potential treatments for patients with ophthalmic diseases such as age-related
macular degeneration (AMD), as well as other novel antibody and protein
regulators of the complement inflammatory pathways.

The acquisition was completed with an upfront cash payment of $111 million
for 100 percent of Taligens equity interests. Additional contingent payments
would be earned upon reaching various clinical efficacy and product approval
milestones in both the US and European Union for up to six products.

"Taligens talented scientists and impressive technology will enhance
Alexions world-class staff and breakthrough research and development
programs, substantially increasing our ability to develop first-in-class
therapies for patients with severe diseases," said Leonard Bell, M.D., Chief
Executive Officer of Alexion. "As product development opportunities continue
to expand, we look forward to increasing the quality, speed, and throughput of
our combined current and future development programs for the benefit of
patients worldwide."

 

Taligens scientific staff will form the nucleus of Alexions new Cambridge
Massachusetts-based Translational Medicine Group, headed by Abbie Celniker,
Ph.D., former CEO of Taligen and now Head of Translational Medicine at
Alexion. Dr. Celniker will report to Stephen Squinto, Ph.D., Executive Vice
President and Head of Research and Development at Alexion. "Alexion has proven
how highly innovative science can result in life-transforming therapies for
patients with debilitating disorders," said Dr. Celniker. "We are excited to
be combining our research and development capabilities with Alexions
global team with the goal of accelerating the investigation of novel
molecules from our combined portfolios and developing additional first-in-
class compounds."

"We are pleased that Alexion recognized the potential of Taligens innovative
product pipeline and exceptional team. This transaction was compelling to us
because of Alexions demonstrated ability to develop and commercialize first-
in-class medicines," said Dr. Nicholas Galakatos, a director of Taligen and a
Managing Director at Clarus Ventures. "I, along with my colleagues at

the success of Taligen and look forward to the many future benefits that this
combination will offer to patients with severe disorders."

Alexion will provide 2011 financial guidance in February, including
transaction-related one-time expenses. Non-GAAP Research and Development
expenses for 2011 are expected to be approximately 18% of sales, including
activities associated with Taligens programs.
