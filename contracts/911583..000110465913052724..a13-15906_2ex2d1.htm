and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" **Acquisition Sub** "), and
Steinway Musical Instruments, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " **Company**
").

 



 

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the terms
and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause
Acquisition Sub to make a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time
as permitted under this Agreement, the " **Offer** ") to purchase all the
outstanding shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(the " **Company Common Stock** "), at a price per share of Company Common
Stock of $35.00 (such amount, or any other amount per share paid pursuant to
the Offer and this Agreement, the " **Offer Price** "), net to the seller
thereof in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of the Company Common Stock

Up Option and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the "
**Transactions** "), in accordance with the DGCL, whereby each issued and
outstanding share of Company Common Stock not owned directly or indirectly by

the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Acquisition Sub has approved and declared
advisable, and the board of directors of Parent has approved, this Agreement
and the Transactions, and Parent, as sole stockholder of Acquisition Sub, has
adopted this Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has (a) determined that the
Transactions are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, (b) approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the
Transactions, and (c) on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the

dated as of the date

      
 

 



 

of this Agreement, pursuant to which the Sponsor has agreed to guaranty the
full amount of the Reverse Termination Fee, if payable, subject to the terms
and conditions contained therein;

 



 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parents and Acquisition Subs willingness to enter into
this Agreement, the Company and the board of directors of the Company have
agreed to take all actions necessary so that no rights shall be issued or
exercisable under the Rights Plan, and the Rights Plan shall have no force or

WHEREAS, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the
Offer and the Merger.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

Section 2.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within ten (10)
Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, commence, within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, the Offer. The obligations of

the Offer are subject to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " **Offer
Conditions** "). The Offer shall initially expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City
time) on the later of (x) the date twenty (20) Business Days following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) and (y) the fifth (5th) Business Day following the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period. Acquisition Sub expressly reserves the right
to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or modify the terms of the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the consent of the Company,
Acquisition Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Acquisition Sub to, (i)
reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii)
reduce the Offer Price, (iii) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Tender
Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any
Offer Condition in any manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock,
(v) except as expressly provided in this _Section 2.1(a)_, terminate, extend
or otherwise amend or modify the

 



      
 

 



 

expiration date of the Offer, (vi) change the form of consideration payable in
the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the
Offer in any manner adverse to any holder of Company Common Stock or (viii)
provide any "subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11
promulgated under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to, (i) extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in
consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days (or such longer period
as the parties hereto may agree) each, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of
the Offer, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall
not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as each such condition
shall have been satisfied or waived and (ii) extend the Offer for the minimum
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if, at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, each Offer
Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied
or waived and the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied, then
Acquisition Sub may and, if requested by the Company, Acquisition Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to, extend the Offer by increments of
five (5) Business Days; _provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum number of
days that the Offer may be extended pursuant to this sentence shall be twenty
(20) Business Days unless requested or approved by the Company; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Termination Date. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company
Common Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer promptly after the expiration of the Offer. Payment of shares of
Company Common Stock by Acquisition Sub pursuant to and subject to the
conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " **Offer
Closing** ," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " **Offer Closing Date**." The Offer may not be
terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with this _Section 2.1(a)_), unless
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_. If (i)
at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, (x) each Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived, (y)
the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied and (z) no further
extensions or re-extensions of the Offer are permitted or required pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(a)_ or (ii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, then, in each case, Acquisition Sub shall promptly (and, in
any event, within twenty four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. The termination of the Offer pursuant to
clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence is referred to in this
Agreement as the " **Offer Termination** ," and the date on which the Offer
Termination occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " **Offer
Termination Date**." If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Acquisition
Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.1_,
Acquisition Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting
on behalf of Acquisition Sub to return, all tendered shares of Company Common
Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
**Schedule TO** "), which shall include, as

 



      
 

 



 

exhibits, an offer to purchase and a related letter of transmittal, a summary
advertisement and other ancillary Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer
will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents attached as exhibits thereto,
together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " **Offer Documents**
"). The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Acquisition Sub all
information concerning the Company that is required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the
Offer Documents and to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or
supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly notify the Company
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any
request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements
to the Offer Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all
correspondence between Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on
the other hand. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to
any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect to the Offer
Documents. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC)
with respect thereto, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or
response.

 



 

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Acquisition Sub on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) On the date the initial Offer Documents are filed with the SEC or as soon
as practicable thereafter, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
" **Schedule 14D-9** "), which shall, subject to the provisions of _Section
6.6_, describe and make the Company Recommendation with respect to the Offer
and include a copy of the opinion referred to in _Section 4.24_, and shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders
of Company Common Stock together with the Offer Documents disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Acquisition Sub
that is required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so

 



      
 

 



 

amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) or any
request from the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) for amendments or supplements
to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC (or the staff of the SEC) with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the
stockholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC (or the
staff of the SEC) with respect thereto, the Company shall provide Parent a
reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or
response. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents
of the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company contained in
the Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Acquisition Sub promptly (and in any event within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common
Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and of those persons becoming
record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of
stockholders, security position listings, computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to Acquisition Sub such
information (including updated lists of stockholders, security position
listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in communicating
the Offer to the Companys stockholders. Subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Transactions, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall keep confidential and not
disclose the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings and
files, in each case as required by the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use
such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company or
destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or control in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. In addition, in connection with
the Offer, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and Acquisition Sub to
disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of shares of Company Common Stock
held in or subject to any Company Benefit Plan and, to the extent provided for
in any such Company Benefit Plan, to permit such holders of shares to tender
shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Top-Up Option_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby grants to Acquisition Sub an irrevocable option (the "
**Top-Up Option** "), exercisable only on the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 2.3_, to purchase at a price per share equal to the Offer
Price that number of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Company Common Stock (the " **Top-Up Option Shares** ") equal to the lowest
number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, shall constitute
one share more than ninety percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding on a "fully diluted basis" immediately after the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option may not
be exercised to the extent that the number of Top-Up Option Shares exceeds
that number of shares of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued
(treating shares owned by the Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not
reserved for issuance at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up
Option shall be exercisable only once, in whole but not in part. The
obligation of the Company to issue and deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon
the exercise of the Top-Up Option is subject to the condition that no
applicable Law shall be in effect that has the effect of enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance and
delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



 

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Option Shares complies with all applicable Laws, including
compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option
Shares under the Securities Act. If there shall have not been validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn that number of shares of Company Common Stock which,
when added to the shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and its
affiliates, would represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding on a "fully diluted" basis on the Offer
Closing Date, Acquisition Sub shall be deemed to have exercised the Top-Up
Option on such date (the " **Top-Up Exercise Date** "). On the Top-Up Exercise
Date, (i) Parent shall give the Company written notice specifying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and
its subsidiaries at the time of such notice (giving effect to the Offer
Closing) and (ii) the Company shall, immediately following receipt of such
notice on the Top-Up Exercise Date, deliver written notice to Acquisition Sub
specifying, based on the information provided by Acquisition Sub in its
notice, the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares (the " **Top-Up Closing** "), which shall take place
at the location specified in _Section 2.6_ and shall be deemed to occur
immediately following the Offer Closing and immediately preceding the Merger
Closing, the purchase price owed by Acquisition Sub to the Company therefor
shall be paid to the Company, at Acquisition Subs option, (i) in cash, by
wire transfer of same-day funds, or (ii) by (x) paying in cash, by wire
transfer of same-day funds, an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par
value of the Top-Up Option Shares and (y) executing and delivering to the
Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the aggregate
purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in cash
pursuant to the preceding clause (x) (the " **Promissory Note** "). The
Promissory Note (i) shall be due on the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up
Closing, (ii) shall bear simple interest of five percent (5%) per annum, (iii)
shall be full recourse to Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or in
part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other
material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to
Acquisition Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

 



 

(c) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that
Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the

 



      
 

 



 

Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

 



 

(d) Any dilutive impact on the value of the shares of Company Common Stock as
a result of the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares will not be taken into
account in any determination of the fair value of any Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL as contemplated by _Section 3.5_.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Directors_.

 



 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and provided that the Minimum Tender Condition
is satisfied, promptly after Acquisition Sub accepts for payment and pays for
any shares of Company Common Stock tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer (the " **Appointment Time** "), and at all times thereafter, Acquisition
Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such number of directors, rounded
up to the next whole number, on the board of directors of the Company as is
equal to the product of the total number of directors on the board of
directors of the Company (giving effect to the directors elected or designated
by Acquisition Sub pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage
that the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned
by Parent and Acquisition Sub bears to the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock then outstanding; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to
applicable Law and the rules of the NYSE, Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to
designate at least a majority of the directors on the board of directors of
the Company at all times following the Appointment Time. Upon Acquisition
Subs request at any time following the Appointment Time, the Company shall,
subject to the terms of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the
Bylaws of the Company, take such actions, including but not limited to filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the board of directors of the
Company, increasing the size of the board of directors of the Company
(including by amending the Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to
increase the size of the board of directors of the Company) and/or requesting
and accepting the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, as
is reasonably necessary to enable Acquisition Subs designees to be so elected
or designated to the board of directors of the Company, and shall cause
Acquisition Subs designees to be so elected or designated at such time. The
Company shall, upon Acquisition Subs request following the Appointment Time,
also cause Persons elected or designated by Acquisition Sub to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the
board of directors of the Company of (i) each committee of the board of
directors of the Company, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of
each subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of
each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
the rules of the NYSE. The Companys obligations under this _Section 2.4(a)_
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this
Agreement take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 2.4(a)_, including
mailing to the Companys stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9,
unless otherwise requested by Parent) the information required by Section
14(f) and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Acquisition Subs designees to
be elected or designated to the board of directors of the Company. Parent
shall supply the Company with, and solely be responsible for, information with
respect to

 



      
 

 



 

Acquisition Subs designees and Parents and Acquisition Subs respective
officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 2.4(a)_ are in addition to and
shall not limit any rights that any of Acquisition Sub, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of
shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise.

 



 

(b) In the event that Acquisition Subs designees are elected or designated to
the board of directors of the Company pursuant to _Section 2.4(a)_, then,
until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause the board of directors of the Company to maintain three directors who
are members of the board of directors of the Company on the date of this
Agreement, each of whom shall be "independent" for purposes of Rule 10A-3 of
the Exchange Act and also eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee
under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and at least one of whom shall be an
"audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the " **Continuing Directors**
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any Continuing Director is unable to
serve due to death, disability or resignation, the Company shall take all
necessary action (including creating a committee of the board of directors of
the Company) so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or
designate another person (or persons) to fill such vacancy, and such person
(or persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this
Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall
designate three persons who shall each qualify as "independent" for purposes
of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and NYSE rules and at least one of whom shall
be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, to fill such vacancies and such
persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
of Acquisition Subs designees have been elected or appointed to the board of
directors of the Company after the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective
Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors
shall (in addition to the approval rights of the stockholders of the Company
as may be required by the governing documents of the Company or applicable
Law) be required (and upon such vote the Company will be deemed authorized
without any further vote of the board of directors) for the Company (i) to
amend or terminate this Agreement, (ii) to extend the time of performance of,
or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition Sub
under this Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights,
benefits or remedies hereunder, (iii) except as provided herein, to amend the
governing documents of the Company, or (iv) to take any other action or make
any other determination of the board of directors of the Company under or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions. The Continuing
Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing Directors to have,
the authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company or the board of directors of the Company) and other advisors at the
expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the
authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce
performance of this Agreement. Following the Appointment Time and prior to the
Effective Time, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall take any action to
remove any Continuing Director subject to the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company.

 **ARTICLE III**

 



 

 ** _EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_**

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Acquisition
Sub or the holders of any securities of Parent, the Company or Acquisition
Sub:

 



 

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock or held by Parent or Acquisition Sub
(including as a result of the exercise of the Top-Up Option by Acquisition
Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be
delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof, and each share of
Company Common Stock owned by any subsidiary of the Company shall be converted
into a share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right
to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " **Merger
Consideration** "). Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section
3.1(b)_ shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the
holders of certificates (the " **Certificates** ") or book-entry shares ("
**Book-Entry Shares** ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon
surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
_Section 3.2_, the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of Acquisition Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective

 



      
 

 



 

Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during
such period, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

 



 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " **Paying
Agent** "), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_ and _Section 3.3_. Immediately
upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash
constituting an amount equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (such
Total Common Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the "
**Exchange Fund** "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to
make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in
an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such
payment. Parent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be held for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock and applied promptly to making the
payments pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_,
except as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second (2nd) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which
instructions shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering holder,
(x) Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may be surrendered by hand delivery or
otherwise or (y) the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor may be
collected by hand by the surrendering holder or by wire transfer to the
surrendering holder).

 



 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions (including, without limitation, any necessary Tax forms),
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to
receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share
of Company

 



      
 

 



 

Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to
be mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered by wire
transfer, as elected by the surrendering holder, within two (2) Business Days
following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the Paying
Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. In the event

registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be issued to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered is registered (the " **Transferee** ") if such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper
form for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer or other Taxes required
by reason of such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares or establishes to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Paying
Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions
as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in
accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or
accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent as
general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for cash, without
interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall

(ii) no such investment shall have maturities that could prevent or delay

to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.3 _Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled without
any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option in consideration
for the right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment with respect thereto
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less any
required withholding Taxes (the " **Option Cash Payment** ," and the sum of
all such payments, the " **Total Option Cash Payments** "). As of the
Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company
Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to receive the Option Cash Payment in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay through its payroll systems the applicable Option Cash
Payments, if any, to the holders of Company Options, subject to _Section
3.4_.

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any
event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to (i) terminate the ESPP as of the Effective Time and, in
accordance with the terms of the ESPP, provide that any "Purchase Period"
(within the meaning of the ESPP) in process on the Merger Closing Date shall
end as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, with such pro-rata
adjustments as may be necessary to reflect a shortened Purchase Period, but
otherwise treating such shortened Purchase Period as a fully effective and
completed Purchase Period for all purposes under the ESPP, (ii) provide that
participants may not increase their payroll deductions or purchase elections
prospectively and (iii) provide that no Purchase Period shall commence under
the ESPP following the date hereof. Any shares of Company Common Stock
acquired as a result of the completion of the Purchase Period that ends as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Section 3.2_.

 



 

Section 3.4 _Withholdings_. Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent and the Surviving Corporations payroll agent
(the " **Payroll Agent"** ) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Options such amounts as Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent or the Payroll Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over
to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Payroll Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Payroll
Agent.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this Article III.

 



 

Section 3.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(b)_, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.
Any payments required to be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall
be made by Parent (and not the Company or Acquisition Sub), and the Total
Common Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, as
if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a stockholder on the
Merger Closing Date. Any portion of the Total Common Merger Consideration made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 3.2 _to pay for Dissenting
Shares will be returned to Parent upon demand. The Company shall give Parent
(a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal or payment of the fair
value of any shares of Company Common Stock or withdrawals of such demands and
(b) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the
DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

Section 3.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided
for in _Section 3.1(b)_, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates.

exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of such determination or
opinion letter that could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect on such qualification or tax-

result of a failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code; and (iii) no

31, 2013, all Inventories (including Inventory ordered but not yet received)
consisted of items of a quality usable or saleable in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices and were in quantities reasonably
sufficient for the normal operation of the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries in accordance with past practices. As used in this _Section
4.21_, the term " **Inventory** " means the inventories of raw materials,
work-in-process (including semi-finished goods) and finished goods or products
(including in-transit inventory) used, useable or otherwise saleable in the
ordinary course of the business of the Company and its subsidiaries,
calculated in accordance with the lower of cost or market method, in
accordance with GAAP.

 



 

Section 4.22 _Suppliers_. _Section 4.22_ of the Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a true, complete and correct list of the ten (10) largest
suppliers, vendors or purchasing agents (" **Suppliers** ") of the Company and
its subsidiaries (determined on the basis of amounts paid by the Company and
its subsidiaries in the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2012), together
with such amounts paid during such period. No Supplier has reduced or
otherwise discontinued, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to
reduce or discontinue, supplying such goods, materials or services to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries on reasonable terms, except for such
reduction or discontinuation as would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.23 _Insurance_. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (a) all material insurance policies maintained by the Company and its
subsidiaries are in full force and effect and all premiums due and payable
thereon have been paid, and (b) neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries is in breach or default of any of the material insurance
policies, and neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any
action, or failed to take any action, which, with notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination or
modification of any of the material insurance policies. Since January 1, 2012
through the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has
received any

 



      
 

 



 

notice of termination or cancellation or, as of the date here of, denial of
coverage with respect to any material insurance policy maintained by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material claim made pursuant to any
such insurance policy.

 



 

Section 4.24 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The board of directors of the
Company has received the opinion of its financial advisor, Allen and Company
LLC, to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the
assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the Offer Price payable to
holders of Company Common Stock (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
respective affiliates) pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial
point of view, to such holders.

 



 

Section 4.25 _Takeover Statutes; Rights Plan_. Assuming the accuracy of the
representation contained in _Section 5.16_, the board of directors of the
Company has taken such actions and votes as are necessary to render the
provisions of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or
any other takeover or anti-takeover statute or similar federal or state Law
(collectively, " **Takeover Statutes** ") and the provisions of the Rights
Agreement inapplicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and the board of
directors of the Company have taken all actions necessary so that neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions (including the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option and the other
Transactions) will cause (a) the grant of any new rights under the Rights Plan
or (b) any rights previously granted under the Rights Plan to become
exercisable.

 



 

Section 4.26 _Vote Required_. Assuming the Minimum Tender Condition has been
satisfied and the Top-Up Option has been exercised by Acquisition Sub in
accordance with _Section 2.3_, no vote of holders of securities of the
Company shall be required to adopt this Agreement or approve the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 4.27 _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker other than
Allen and Company LLC is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger and any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of the Company.

 



 

Section 4.28 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any other person on behalf of the Company makes any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or with respect
to any other information provided to Parent or Acquisition Sub in connection
with the Transactions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE V**

 



 

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB_**

 

Except as disclosed in the separate disclosure letter which has been delivered
by Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (which shall
be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered
and letter sections contained in this Agreement and the disclosure in any
section shall be deemed to qualify and apply to other sections in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement only to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that
such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other sections) (the "
**Parent Disclosure Letter** "), Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby jointly and
severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

 



 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub has the
requisite corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental
approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
power, authority and governmental approvals would not have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.2 _Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Other Organizational
Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws (or equivalent
organizational or governing documents), and other organizational or governing
documents, agreements or arrangements, each as amended to date, of each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub (collectively, " **Parent Organizational
Documents** "). The Parent Organizational Documents are in full force and
effect. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is in violation of any provision of
the Parent Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and, with respect to Acquisition Sub, by
its sole stockholder, with such consent attached hereto as _Exhibit A_), and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub are
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions (other than, with respect to the Merger, the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State). This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Company, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of Parent and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Parent and Acquisition Sub
in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights, and to general equitable principles).

 



 

Section 5.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, the consummation by Parent or Acquisition Sub of the
Transactions or compliance by Parent or Acquisition Sub with any of the
provisions of this Agreement will (i) conflict with or violate the certificate
of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing
documents) of (x) Parent or (y) Acquisition Sub, (ii) assuming the consents,
approvals and authorizations specified in _Section 5.4(b)_ have been received
and the waiting

 



      
 

 



 

periods referred to therein have expired, and any condition precedent to such
consent, approval, authorization, or waiver has been satisfied, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to Parent or Acquisition Sub or by which any
property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub is bound or affected or (iii)
result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice
or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any
right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien (other than, in the case of the Financing, any Lien
required or permitted thereunder) on any property or asset of Parent or
Acquisition Sub pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit
agreement, or any other contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise
or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or Acquisition Sub is a
party or by which Parent or Acquisition Sub or any property or asset of Parent
or Acquisition Sub is bound, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii), for any such violations, breaches, defaults, rights, terminations,
amendments, accelerations, or cancellations which would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition
Sub, the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the Transactions or
compliance by Parent or Acquisition Sub with any of the provisions of this
Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, authorization, waiver or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority,
except for applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange Act, the Securities Act
or Blue Sky Laws, (ii) any applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) the DGCL, and (iv)
the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and except where failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications, would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no
claim, action, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Sponsor or any of
their respective affiliates or any of their respective properties or assets at
law or in equity, and there are no Orders by or before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority, in each case as would have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Except as contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any
contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or
written), or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any contract,
arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether oral or written), pursuant
to which: (a) any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Offer Price or the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i)
agrees to tender its shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer or, if
required by applicable Law, to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or
(ii) agrees to vote against, or not to tender its shares of Company Common
Stock in, any Superior Proposal; or (b) any third party has agreed to provide,
directly or indirectly, equity capital (other than pursuant to the Equity
Commitment Letter) to Parent or the Company to finance in whole or in part the
Offer or the Merger.

 



 

Section 5.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Acquisition Sub expressly for inclusion
or incorporation by

 



      
 

 



 

reference in the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 or the Information
Statement will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, at any time
such document is amended or supplemented or at the time such document is first
published, sent or given to the Companys stockholders, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by the Company or any of their respective Representatives
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents or the
Schedule 14D-9.

 



 

Section 5.8 _Financing_

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
the executed commitment letters from MIHI LLC, Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc.,
and General Electric Capital Corporation, together with any related fee
letter, engagement letter or other agreement, with only the fee amounts
redacted (collectively, the " **Debt Commitment Letters** "), pursuant to
which, and subject to the terms and conditions thereof, the lender parties
thereto have committed to lend the amounts set forth therein to Parent and/or
Acquisition Sub for the purpose of funding the Transactions (the " **Debt
Financing** "), and (ii) the executed equity commitment letter, dated as of
the date of this Agreement (the " **Equity Commitment Letter** " and, together
with the Debt Commitment Letters, the " **Financing Commitments** ") from
Sponsor pursuant to which the Sponsor has committed to invest the amounts set
forth therein (the " **Equity Financing** " and, together with the Debt
Financing, the " **Financing** "). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and
will continue to provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary
thereof.

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, all of the Financing Commitments are in
full force and effect and have not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise
amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. Each of the Financing
Commitments, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent or Acquisition Sub and, to the knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto. There are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements (except for customary fee letters and engagement
letters) relating to the Financing Commitments. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub under any term, or a failure
of any condition, of the Financing Commitments or otherwise result in any
portion of the Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. Subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions contained in _Section 7.1_ and the Offer
Conditions, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub has reason to believe that it
would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the
Financing Commitments required to be satisfied by it. Parent and/or
Acquisition Sub have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Financing Commitments to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
_Section 7.1_ and the Offer Conditions (other than the Financing Proceeds
Condition) and (ii) the funding of the Financing in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, the aggregate proceeds
from the Financing, together with Company cash, shall, in the aggregate, be
sufficient to fund all of the amounts required to be provided by Parent for
the consummation of the Transactions, and are sufficient for the satisfaction
of all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of each share
of Company Common Stock validly tendered and accepted for payment in the
Offer, the Aggregate Merger Consideration and the payment of all associated
costs and expenses of the Offer and the Merger (including any repayment or
refinancing of indebtedness of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company required
in connection therewith). There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full
amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in or contemplated
by the Financing Commitments.

 



 

(c) Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is aware of any direct or indirect
limitation or other restriction on the ability of the lender parties to the
Debt Financing to provide financing for other potential purchasers of the
Company.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1,000
shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Acquisition Sub was formed solely
for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions, and it has not conducted any
business prior to the date of this Agreement and has no, and prior to the
Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Interest in Competitors_. To the knowledge of Parent, Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Sponsor do not own any interest, nor do any of their
respective affiliates insofar as such affiliate-owned interests would be
attributed to Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Sponsor under the HSR Act, in any
entity or person that derives revenues from products, services or lines of
business within the Companys products, services or lines of business.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Investment Intention_. Parent is acquiring through the Merger
the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation for its own account,
for investment purposes only and not with a view to the distribution (as such
term is used in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act) thereof. Parent
understands that the shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation have
not been registered under the Securities Act and cannot be sold unless
subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from such
registration is available.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Brokers_. Other than Bell Capital Advisory Partners, L.L.C.,
whose fees and expenses shall be borne solely by Parent, no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger and any of the other
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or the
Sponsor.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Sponsor is
entering into the Transactions with the actual intent to hinder, delay or
defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is Solvent as of the date of
this Agreement. Assuming (a) that the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article IV_ are true and correct in all respects material to the
representations and warranties set forth in this _Section 5.13_, (b) the
satisfaction of the conditions in _Section 7.1_ and

 



      
 

 



 

the Offer Conditions and (c) any estimates, projections or forecasts of the
Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in good faith based upon
assumptions that were and continue to be true and correct, the Surviving
Corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will, after giving effect
to all of the Transactions, including the Financing, any alternative financing
and the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and the aggregate Merger
Consideration, the payment of all other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and the payment of all
related fees and expenses, be Solvent at the Effective Time. As used in this
_Section 5.13_, the term " **Solvent** " means, with respect to a particular
date, that on such date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of
Parent and Acquisition Sub (and, after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation)
(on a consolidated basis) and each of them (on a stand alone basis) will
exceed their debts, (b) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and, after the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) and each of them
(on a stand alone basis) has not incurred and does not intend to incur, and
does not believe that it will incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such
debts as such debts mature, and (c) each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (and,
after the Merger, the Surviving Corporation) (on a consolidated basis) and
each of them (on a stand alone basis) has sufficient capital and liquidity
with which to conduct its business at the Effective Time. For purposes of this
_Section 5.13_, " **debt** " means any liability on a claim, and " **claim**
" means any (a) right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to
judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (b) any
right to an equitable remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives
rise to a payment, whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced
to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
secured or unsecured.

 



 

Section 5.14 _DGCL Section 203_. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub is, nor
at any time during the last three (3) years has either Parent or Acquisition
Sub been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203
of the DGCL.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the guaranty of Sponsor, dated
as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company in respect of
certain obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub under this Agreement, up to
the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " **Limited Guaranty** "). The
Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Sponsor, enforceable against the Sponsor in accordance with
its terms. There has been no default under the Limited Guaranty by the
Sponsor, and no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default thereunder by the Sponsor.

 



 

Section 5.16 _Parent Ownership of Company Securities_. Parent, the Sponsor and
their respective subsidiaries do not beneficially own (as such term is used in
Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) any shares of Company Common
Stock or other securities of the Company or any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire Company Common Stock or other securities of, or any other
economic interest (through derivative securities or otherwise) in, the
Company.

 



 

Section 5.17 _Management Agreements_. As of the date hereof, other than this
Agreement, there are no contracts, undertakings, commitments, agreements or
obligations

 



      
 

 



 

between the Sponsor, Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management or the
board of directors or any of the Companys affiliates, on the other hand,
relating in any way to the Transactions or the operations of the Company after
the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.18 _WARN Act_. Parent and Acquisition Sub are neither planning nor
contemplating, and Parent and Acquisition Sub have neither made nor taken, any
decisions or actions concerning the Company Employees after the Closing that
would require the service of notice under the WARN Act or similar local laws.

 



 

Section 5.19 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Parent and Acquisition Sub each acknowledges and agrees that,
except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement (a) neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries makes, or has
made, any representation or warranty relating to itself or its business or
otherwise in connection with the Offer and the Merger and Parent and
Acquisition Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty except for
those expressly set forth in this Agreement, (b) no person has been authorized
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries to make any representation or
warranty relating to itself or its business or otherwise in connection with
the Offer and Merger, and if made, such representation or warranty must not be
relied upon by Parent or Acquisition Sub as having been authorized by such
entity, and (c) any estimate, projection, prediction, data, financial
information, memorandum, presentation or any other materials or information
provided or addressed to Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
Representatives, including any materials or information made available in the
Electronic Data Room or in connection with presentations by the Companys
management or otherwise, are not and shall not be deemed to be or include
representations or warranties unless and to the extent any such materials or
information is the subject of any express representation or warranty set forth
in Article IV. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that it has
conducted, to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the
condition, operations and business of the Company and its subsidiaries and, in
making its determination to proceed with the Transactions, including the
Offer, the Merger and the Financing, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub has
relied on the results of its own independent investigation.

Section 6.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

_Annex I_ and _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including (i) the obtaining of

all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to
avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons
necessary in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) the

efforts, to obtain any third party consents not covered by paragraphs (a) and

payment in connection with the Companys or its affiliates obligations under

request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and (ii) will cooperate in responding to any inquiry
from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the other party

submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies
of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party
and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, obtaining any third party consents pursuant to this _Section
6.4(c)_ shall not be considered a

 



      
 

 



 

condition to the obligations of the Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate
the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the earlier

privilege held by the Company, (iii) otherwise violate any applicable Laws or
(iv) interfere unreasonably with the business and operations of the Company or
its subsidiaries or could otherwise result in significant interference with
the prompt and timely discharge by employees of the Company or its
subsidiaries of their duties (it being agreed that the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents pursuant to clauses (i) through (iv) above and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the
applicable privilege or protection or violate the applicable restriction).

Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

furnishing such information or affording such access, the Company has entered

Competing Proposal or any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal.

 



 

(b) From and after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, (i) the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its directors, officers, Representatives and
subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing

or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal;
and (ii) the Company shall request that each Third Party (other than any
Excluded Party for so long as such person or group is an Excluded Party) that

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.6_, the Company shall
not, shall cause its directors, officers and subsidiaries not to, and shall
cause each of its Representatives and its subsidiaries Representatives not
to, from the expiration of the Go-Shop Period until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 8.1_, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,

with (other than to state they are not permitted to engage discussions or
negotiations), or furnish any non-public information relating to the Company

(e) At any time after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the
Offer Closing, the Company or its board of directors, directly or indirectly

Third Party making a Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that prior
to so furnishing such information, the Company has entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party and previously provided such
information to Parent), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Third Party with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case if: (x)
such Third Party has submitted a bona fide written Competing Proposal that did
not result from a breach of this _Section 6.6_ and that the board of
directors of the Company, or any duly authorized committee thereof, determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors,
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and (y) the board of directors of the Company, or any duly authorized
committee thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation with legal
counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in this _Section 6.6(e)_, the Company shall notify Parent
and Acquisition Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-
public information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this _Section 6.6(e)_.

Recommendation Change** "); or (iii) cause or permit the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

(x) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this _Section 6.6_, subject to compliance with
_Section 6.6(g)_ and _Section 8.3_, if the board of directors of the Company
(A) has received a Competing Proposal that, in the good faith determination of
the board of directors of the Company, constitutes, a Superior Proposal, after
having complied with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be
offered by Parent and Acquisition Sub pursuant to, _Section 6.6(g)_, and (B)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (y) to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition, if the board
of directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its legal advisors, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under _Section 6.6(f)_
with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided prior
written notice at least three (3) full Business Days in advance (and does not
take action until after 12:01 a.m. on the day following such third (3rd) full
Business Day) (a " **Notice of Superior Proposal** ") to Parent and
Acquisition Sub that the Company intends to take such action and describing
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis
of such action (including the identity of the Third Party and unredacted
copies of all proposed transaction documents, including any financing
commitments, including redacted fee letters relating thereto), (ii) during the
three (3) Business Day period following Parents and Acquisition Subs receipt
of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Acquisition Sub in good faith
(to the extent Parent and Acquisition Sub desire to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Commitment
Letters so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal, and shall provide to Parent a brief summary of any material terms of
the Superior Proposal not provided to the Company in writing, (iii) following
the end of the three (3) Business Day period, the board of directors of the
Company shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal
and financial advisors and taking into account any changes to this Agreement
and the Commitment Letters proposed in writing by Parent and Acquisition Sub
in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior
Proposal giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) in the event of any material amendment
to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior
Proposal, a new Notice of Superior Proposal shall have been provided by the
Company to Parent and the Company shall be required to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 6.6(g)_, except that references to the three
(3) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period;

 



 

 _provided_ , that the Company has complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this _Section 6.6_; _provided_ , _further_ , that any
purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_
shall be void and of no force or effect unless the Company pays Parent the
Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
board of directors, directly or indirectly through its Representatives, from
(i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication
to the Companys stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen"
communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Companys stockholders) if the board of directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosures permitted
under this _Section 6.6(h)(ii)_ shall not be a basis, in themselves, for
Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_.

 



 

(i) From the date hereof until the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company
shall be permitted to grant a waiver substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit B_ (the " **Standstill Waiver** ") under any "standstill" or
similar obligation of any Third Party with respect to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries solely to allow such Third Party to submit a Competing
Proposal in compliance with this _Section 6.6_. After the expiration of the
Go-Shop Period, the Company shall not grant any waiver or release under any
"standstill" or similar obligation with respect to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , at any time prior to the Offer Closing,
the board of directors of the Company may grant a waiver or release under any
standstill agreement with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries if
the board of directors of the Company, or any duly authorized committee
thereof, determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Except as contemplated by
this _Section 6.6(i)_, the Company shall enforce, and shall not release or
permit the release of any Third Party from, or amend, waive, terminate or
modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination or
modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement or
provision to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or under
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries has any rights. The Company shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Representatives to, enter into any
confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement which
prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information specifically
required to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.6_.

 



 

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Competing Proposal** " shall mean, other than the Transactions, any
bona fide proposal or offer (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any
of its subsidiaries), including any amendments, adjustments, changes,
revisions and supplements thereto, from a Third Party relating to (i) a
merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint
venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company as
determined on a book-value basis; (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger,
consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Third
Party of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value
basis; (iii) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any
Third Party of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, or (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender
offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Third Party
beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of the Company Common Stock
or any class of equity or voting securities of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company as
determined on a book-value basis.

 



 

(ii) " **Excluded Party** " shall mean any Third Party from which the Company
received during the Go-Shop Period a written Competing Proposal that: (a)
remains pending as of, and shall not have been withdrawn prior to, the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period; and (b) the board of directors of the
Company reasonably determines in good faith during the one (1) Business Day
period commencing upon the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, after
consultation with the Companys financial and legal advisors, constitutes or
is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , however,
that a person that is an Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party
upon the withdrawal, termination or expiration of such Competing Proposal (as
it may be amended, adjusted, changed, revised, extended and supplemented).

 



 

(iii) " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean a written Competing Proposal (with
all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty
percent (50%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, and considering such factors as the board of
directors of the Company considers to be appropriate (including the
conditionality and the timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposal,
as well as any legal, financial, regulatory or other aspects of such proposal,
including the person or group making the Competing Proposal and any break-up
fee, conditions to consummation and financing terms), are more favorable to
the Company and its stockholders than the Transactions (after giving effect to
all adjustments to the terms thereof which may be offered by Parent in writing
(including pursuant to _Section 6.6(g))_.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time
(including any matters arising in connection with the Transactions), existing
as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its subsidiaries
as provided in the Companys or each of the Companys subsidiaries respective
articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable
organizational or governing documents) or in any agreement, shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. After the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless,
and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by
them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent required by: (x) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates as in effect on the date of this
Agreement and (y) any indemnification agreement of the Company or its
subsidiaries or other applicable contract as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions
referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y) above in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnitees with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the Effective Time for a period of
six years after the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.7(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the same
extent as such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date hereof under the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and the Bylaws of the Company and the equivalent organizational or governing
documents of each of the Companys subsidiaries: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (x) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates; or (y) the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and any transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final
disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the
expenses (including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
_Section 6.7(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or
otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.7(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " **D andO
Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at
least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any
claim related to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of

 



      
 

 



 

liability that are no less favorable in all material respects than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable in
all material respects than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) Parent will provide, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six
(6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the
Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage
for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy of the
Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the
best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the
DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and _provided further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.7_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_. The provisions of this _Section 6.7_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. To the extent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, is the non-prevailing party with respect to any
indemnification claims or disputes by any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section
6.7_, Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnitee with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7 _to
the contrary, this _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and
shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any
of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.7_.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or
from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be required
in connection with any of the Transactions, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could be
material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any actions,
suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such partys
knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions, and (c) the discovery by a party to this Agreement of any
fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which could
reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions of the obligations of
such party to consummate the Merger as set forth in Article VII or the Offer
not to be satisfied or the satisfaction of which to be materially delayed.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and none of the parties shall issue any such press release or
make any public statement prior to obtaining the other parties consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except that no such
consent shall be necessary to the extent disclosure may be required by Law,
Order or applicable stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party
hereto.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor or cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume or honor the Collective Bargaining Agreements.
During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of
the Company and any of its subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of
employment are not governed by any Collective Bargaining Agreements (" **Non-
Union Company Employees** " and, collectively with employees of the Company
and any of its subsidiaries whose terms and conditions of employment are
governed by Collective Bargaining Agreements, the " **Company Employees** ") a
base salary or wage rate at least equal to the Non-Union Company Employees
base salary or wage rate in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time and compensation and benefits (excluding equity-based compensation and
benefits provided under any defined benefit pension plan) that are, in the
aggregate for all such employees as a group, no less favorable than to the
compensation and benefits being provided to Non-Union Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Without limiting paragraph (a) of this _Section 6.10_ , during the one
(1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to Non-Union Company
Employees who experience a termination of employment, severance benefits that
are no less favorable than the severance benefits that would have been
provided under a Company Benefit Plan to such employees upon such a
termination of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time or, if more
favorable, the severance benefits provided by Parent or its subsidiaries to
other similarly situated employees

 



      
 

 



 

at the time of such termination of employment, and Parent shall honor, fulfill
and discharge, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, fulfill and
discharge, the Companys and its subsidiaries obligations under any Company
Benefit Plan, without any amendment or change that is adverse to any
participant therein.

 



 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, determination of level of benefits and
vesting but not benefit accrual under the compensation and benefit plans,
programs agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any respective subsidiary and affiliate thereof providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Merger Closing Date, other than
defined benefit plans (the " **New Plans** "), including for purposes of
accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New
Plans, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company, the Company subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before
the Merger Closing Date, to the same extent as such Company Employee was
entitled, before the Merger Closing Date, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent such service credit will
result in the duplication of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to
the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable
Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately
before the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company
Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents under a
Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Effective Time to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 



 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any Company Benefit Plan, for purposes of any Company Benefit
Plan containing a definition of "change in control" or "change of control" or
concepts of similar meaning, the Closing shall be deemed to constitute a
"change in control" or "change of control" (or event of similar meaning, as
the case may be).

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any representative of any
such employee, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any period or terms of employment, for any nature
whatsoever, (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
including the amendment or termination of any employee benefit or compensation
plan, program or arrangement, after the Merger Closing Date or (iii) be
construed to amend any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit or
compensation plan, program or arrangement of the Company, Parent, or any
affiliate of either.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to:

 



 

(i) effectuate _Section 3.3(a)_ (including, without limitation, providing any
required notices and obtaining any required consents); and

 



 

(ii) ensure following the Effective Time that no holder (or former holder) of
Company Options, or any participant (or former participant) in any Company
Benefit Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any shares of capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests (including "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) in, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective subsidiaries.

 



 

The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity
to comment upon, all resolutions and other written actions as may be required
to effectuate the provisions of _Section 3.3(a)_. For purpose of the foregoing
sentence, a reasonable opportunity shall mean at least three (3) Business Days
prior to the adoption of the resolution or taking of the action.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Conduct of Business by Parent Pending the Merger_. Parent and
Acquisition Sub covenant and agree with the Company that between the date
hereof and the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, if
any, pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , Parent and Acquisition Sub shall not, and
shall not permit any of its subsidiaries to, take or agree to take any action
that would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and its
affiliates and its and their respective Representatives shall not incur any
liability to any person under, any financing that Parent and Acquisition Sub
may raise in connection with the Transactions until the Closing and that if
this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or
expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than information
provided by the Company or any of its subsidiaries expressly for use in
connection therewith, or historical financial information relating to the
Company or its subsidiaries), except to the extent such losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses arose out of or resulted from the fraud, willful
misconduct or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, any of its
subsidiaries or its or their respective representatives.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the
proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments (subject to any market flex provisions applicable
thereto), including using their respective reasonable best efforts to: (i)
negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contained in

 



      
 

 



 

the Financing Commitments (subject to any market flex provisions applicable
thereto), which agreements shall be in effect on or prior to the Offer Closing
Date and (ii) satisfy, or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to Parent, Acquisition Sub or their respective
Representatives in such definitive agreements. If all conditions to the
Financing Commitments have been satisfied, Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the lenders and any other persons providing Financing to
fund the Financing at the Offer Closing (with respect to amounts required to
consummate the Offer) and the Merger Closing (with respect to amounts required
to consummate the Merger).

 



 

(c) Parent shall not agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any
waivers of, any condition or other provision under the Financing Commitments
and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or any portion of the
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources without the prior
written consent of the Company (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) if such amendments waivers or modifications would (i)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including by changing the amount
of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing), (ii)
impose new or additional conditions or expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner materially adverse to
Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company or (iii) otherwise be reasonably likely
to (A) prevent or materially delay or impair the ability of Parent to
consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions or (B) adversely
impact the ability of Parent or Acquisition Sub to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Financing Commitments.

 



 

(d) In no event shall Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their affiliates
(which for purposes of this _Section 6.12(d)_ shall be deemed to include each
direct or indirect investor or potential investor in Parent or Acquisition
Sub, or any of Parents, Acquisition Subs or such investors financing
sources or potential financing sources or other Representatives) (i) award any
agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or person
except Bell Capital Advisory Partners, L.L.C. any financial advisory role on
an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions or
(ii) prohibit or seek to prohibit any bank or investment bank or other
potential provider of debt financing, including MIHI LLC, Macquarie Capital
(USA) Inc., and General Electric Capital Corporation, from providing or
seeking to provide financing or financial advisory services to any person in
connection with a transaction relating to the Company or its subsidiaries or
in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions. Except as required by
_Section 6.12(e)_ , without the written consent of the Company (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), neither Parent, nor
Acquisition Sub shall seek or obtain any equity commitments or equity
financing in respect of any of the Transactions, or provide any information in
respect thereof to any potential investor in Parent or Acquisition Sub, or any
of Parents, Acquisition Subs or such investors financing sources or
potential financing sources or other Representatives, who have not been
provided any such information prior to the date of this Agreement, other than
as set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, and other than commitments by affiliated funds and limited
partners of such funds.

 



 

(e) In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable in the
manner or from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments and such
portion is required to consummate the Transactions, (i) Parent shall promptly
notify the Company and (ii)

 



      
 

 



 

Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to, alternative financing from the same or alternative financial
institutions in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions upon
conditions not materially less favorable (as determined in the good faith
judgment of Parent), taken as a whole, to Parent, Acquisition Sub and the
Company than those in the Financing Commitments, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event (and in any event no later than the
Offer Closing Date or the Merger Closing Date, as applicable). The definitive
agreements entered into pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section
6.12(c)_ , _Section 6.12(b)(i)_ or _Section 6.12(c)_ are referred to in this
Agreement, collectively, as the " **Financing Agreements**." The lenders and
other financing sources (including underwriters, placement agents and initial
purchasers) providing the Debt Financing pursuant to any of the Financing
Agreements are referred to in this Agreement, collectively, as the "
**Lenders**."

 



 

(f) Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to cause the Lenders to fund that portion of the Debt Financing
(or any alternative debt financing) required to fund the Transactions into
escrow at least five (5) days prior to the end of the initial Offer period,
with the release of such escrowed funds to be subject only to the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and Annex I (other than the
Financing Proceeds Condition), and thereafter upon such funding into escrow
the Financing Proceeds Condition shall be deemed irrevocably waived.

 



 

(g) Parent and Acquisition Sub shall, and shall cause their affiliates and
representatives to, use reasonable best efforts to comply with the terms and
satisfy on a timely basis the conditions that are within their respective
control of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing commitment,
the Financing Agreements and any related fee and engagement letters. Any
material breach of the Financing Commitment, the Financing Agreements, any
alternative financing commitment or any alternative financing agreement by
Parent or Acquisition Sub shall be deemed a breach by Parent of this _Section
6.12_. Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed
copies of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement
promptly upon their execution, (ii) give the Company prompt notice of any
material breach or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened material breach by
any party of any of the Financing Commitments, any alternative financing
commitment, the Financing Agreements, or any alternative financing agreement
of which Parent or Acquisition Sub becomes aware or any termination or
threatened termination thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company
reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing (or
any alternative financing); _provided_ , that Parent shall be under no
obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client
privilege or protection; so long as Parent shall give notice to the Company of
the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter
the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Financing Cooperation_. The Company shall and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, at Parents sole expense, use reasonable best efforts to
provide all cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(for purposes of this _Section 6.13_ , including (i) any flex applicable to
the Debt Financing and (ii) any alternative financing obtained in connection
with _Section 6.12(c)_ ) as may be reasonably requested by Parent. Such
cooperation

 



      
 

 



 

by the Company shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, (a)
agreeing to enter into such agreements, and to use its reasonable best efforts
to deliver such officers certificates (including a solvency certificate of
the chief financial officer of the Company in the form contemplated by the
Financing Commitments), as are customary in financings of such type and as
are, in the good faith determination of the persons executing such officers
certificates, accurate, and agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in,
and otherwise grant liens on, the Companys assets pursuant to such agreements
as may be reasonably requested, provided that no obligation of the Company
under any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the
Effective Time, (b) providing to the Lenders financial and other information
in the Companys possession in accordance with _Section 6.5(a)_ and _Section
6.5(b)_ , including all financial statements and financial data of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of
type and form customarily included in private placements under Rule 144A of
the Securities Act, to consummate the offerings of any debt securities
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, (c) making the Companys officers
available to assist the Lenders (including by participating in a reasonable
number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions,
drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies, and reasonably
cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and Acquisition Sub and such
lenders), (d) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, offering documents, syndication documents (including bank

and investor presentations), business projections and similar documents
required in connection with the Financing and other documents required in
connection with obtaining the Debt Financing, (e) obtaining legal opinions and
issuing customary representation letters to auditors and using reasonable best
efforts to (1) obtain accountants comfort letters and consents to the use of

rating agencies for the Debt Financing and (3) assist the Parent and

all documentation and other information required by Governmental Authorities
under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and

writing by any Lender no less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, (g) arranging for documentation reasonably facilitating the
pledging of collateral (including requesting customary payoff letters,
releases, lien terminations, waivers, consents, estoppels, approvals as may be
required in connection therewith and instruments of discharge) to be delivered
at or prior to Merger Closing relating to all indebtedness to be paid off,
discharged and terminated on the Merger Closing, (h) taking corporate actions
reasonably necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to
permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to the Company by the Company
and its subsidiaries, (i) cooperating reasonably with the Lenders due
diligence, to the extent customary and reasonable and (j) otherwise reasonably
cooperating in connection with the consummation of the Financing. Parent shall
promptly reimburse the Company for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
costs incurred in connection with the Companys or its affiliates obligations
under this _Section 6.13_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall be required to
pay any commitment or other similar fee

 



      
 

 



 

or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Financing (or any alternative financing)
prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Acquisition Sub_. Parent will take all actions necessary to (a)
cause Acquisition Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, (b) cause the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and (c) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments other
than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, or incur or guarantee any
indebtedness.

 



 

Section 6.15 _No Control of the Company s Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the Companys or its subsidiaries operations prior to
the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its and its subsidiaries operations.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
Company will take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt
under Rule 14d-10(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment
compensation, severance or employee benefit arrangements that have been or
will be entered into after the date of this Agreement by the Company or its
subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its subsidiaries and to ensure that any such arrangements fall
within the safe harbor provisions of such rule.

 



 

Section 6.17 _Rule 16b-3 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may take such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate to
ensure that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including

terminate upon the Effective Time. The Company has taken and will continue to
take all actions necessary so that neither the execution nor delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions (including the Offer, the
Top-Up Option and the Merger) will cause any rights to be granted under the
Rights Plan or cause the rights previously granted under the Rights Plan to
become exercisable.

respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
result in a failure of any Offer Condition set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii)
of paragraph (e) of _Annex I_ , and (B) cannot be cured on or before the
Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within (1) thirty
(30) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach or
failure or (2) any shorter period of time that remains between the date Parent
provides written notice of such breach and the Termination Date or (y) a
Company Material Adverse Effect occurs or exists such that any Offer Condition
set forth in _Annex I_ becomes incapable of being met; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ if: (I) the Offer Closing shall have occurred or (II)
Parent or Acquisition Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; or

 



 

(ii) the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have materially breached
_Section 6.6_ ; or

 



 

(iii) (x) the board of directors of the Company shall have made an Adverse

period shall be extended for an additional three (3) Business Days following
any material modification to such Competing Proposal occurring after the
receipt of Parents written request and (II) such reaffirmation may include
such additional disclosures as would reasonably be necessary to satisfy the
fiduciary duties of the board of directors of the Company or comply with
applicable Law); or (y) the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any
party hereto or the Debt Financing Sources (or any of their respective
Representatives), and all rights and obligations of any party hereto shall
cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.3_ or in any other provision of this Agreement, no such termination shall
relieve any party hereto of any liability or damages (which the parties
acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to

 



      
 

 



 

reimbursement of Expenses or out-of-pocket costs) resulting from any material
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, in which case the
aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or in
equity; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Limited Guaranty and the provisions of _Section 6.5(b)_ (Access to
Information; Confidentiality), _Section 6.9_ (Public Announcements), the
indemnification provisions of _Section 6.12_ (Financing), the expense
reimbursement provisions of _Section 6.13_ (Financing Cooperation), this
_Section 8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ (Termination Fees), _Article_ IX (General
Provisions) and Appendix A shall survive any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.1_.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

 



 

(i) (x) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ or
_Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ or _Section
8.1(d)(iii)(x)_ and (y) (A) a Competing Proposal has been made to the Company
after the date hereof and publicly announced and has not been withdrawn prior
to the termination of this Agreement, and (B) within twelve (12) months of the
termination of this Agreement, the Company (1) enters into a definitive
agreement for the consummation of a Competing Proposal and such Competing
Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of whether such consummation
occurs within the twelve (12) month period) or (2) consummates a Competing
Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the
Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation of such transaction arising
from such Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ , the references to "fifteen percent (15%)" in the
definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)");

 



 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(iii)(y)_ , then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with such termination;

 



 

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 8.1(d)(iii)(x)_ ,
then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee
not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination;

 



 

(iv) the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or _Section 8.1(c)(iv)_ ,
then Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Company the Reverse
Termination Fee not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such
termination.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the parties agree that in no event shall the Company or Parent be required
to pay the Termination Fee or the Reverse Termination Fee, as the case may be,
on more than one occasion;

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) the parties agree that the Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination
Fee shall be reduced by any amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under applicable Tax Law; and

 



 

(iii) any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ shall be paid by
wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with this _Section 8.3_.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Termination Fee** " means an amount equal to $13.35 million, except
that if the Termination Fee becomes payable by the Company in connection with
a Competing Proposal from, or an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with, an
Excluded Party that (A) did not submit a written indication of interest,
proposal or offer for the Company in accordance with the Companys process
letter to Sponsor dated June 3, 2013 or similar letter, the Termination Fee
shall be an amount equal to $6.675 million;

 



 

(ii) " **Reverse Termination Fee** " means an amount equal to $31.15 million.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to the Companys right set forth in _Section 9.9_ (Specific
Performance), the Companys right to receive payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_ shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company and its subsidiaries against Parent,
Acquisition Sub, the Sponsor, the Debt Financing Sources or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents,
affiliates or assignees (collectively, the " **Parent Related Parties** ") for
all losses and damages suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions
to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Parent Related Parties
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of
this Agreement or the Transactions (except that Parent shall also be obligated
for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained
in _Section 6.13_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, but subject to _Section 9.9_, Parents right to receive
payment from the Company of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub
against the Company and its subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " **Company Related Parties** ") for all losses and damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount, none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions (except that the Company shall also be obligated for any of its
expense reimbursement obligations contained in _Section 8.3(e)_). For the
avoidance of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance of the type contemplated by _Section 9.9_ and the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee under _Section 8.3(a)(iv)_, under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a

 



      
 

 



 

grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section 9.9_ and
monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) In the event that the Company or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_, the Company shall pay Parent or its designees, as
promptly as possible (but in any event within two (2) Business Days) following
the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor, all out-of-pocket fees and
expenses incurred by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates
in connection with the Transactions, including the Financing (the " **Parent
Expenses** "); _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to pay more
than an aggregate of $2 million in Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section
8.3(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that the Company shall not be required to pay
any amounts pursuant to this _Section 8.3(e)_ if (i) Parent or Acquisition
Sub is in material breach of this Agreement or (ii) the Company is entitled to
the Reverse Termination Fee. The payment of the expense reimbursement pursuant
to this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent
obligation to pay the applicable Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section
8.3_.

 



 

(f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) each of
the Termination Fee and the Reverse Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is
liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company or
Parent, as the case may be, in the circumstances in which such fee is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ and, in order to obtain such payment, either
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the other party for the payment of any amount set forth in
this _Section 8.3_, such paying party shall pay the other party its
reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection with
such suit, together with interest on such amount at the annual rate of five
percent (5%) plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the date such
payment was actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted
by applicable Law.

Section 9.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Appendix, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of, or an Appendix, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate
or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any Law defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented,
including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
Laws. References to a person are also to its successors and permitted assigns.
All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the United States of
America. References to " **wholly owned subsidiaries** " of the Company shall
include any subsidiary of which the Company owns, directly or indirectly, 100%
of the equity interests. An Offer Condition shall be deemed to be satisfied at
any time if such Offer Condition shall not have occurred on or prior to such
time or, if such Offer Condition shall have occurred prior to such time, such
Offer Condition shall not be continuing at such time. For the avoidance of
doubt, any document included in the Electronic Data Room as of the date hereof
shall be deemed to have been "provided" or "made available" to Parent and
Acquisition Sub for purposes of the Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
(c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term

 



      
 

 



 

or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the
Limited Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
6.7_, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except for (a) the rights of the Companys
stockholders and holders of Company Options to receive the Merger
Consideration and the Option Consideration at the Effective Time, (b) the
right of the Company, on behalf of its stockholders and holders of Company
Options, as applicable, to collect the Total Common Merger Consideration and
Option Consideration (or any portion thereof) and/or pursue damages (which
shall include, to the extent proven, the total amount that could have been
claimed by the Companys stockholders and holders of Company Options if such
holders brought an action against Parent and Acquisition Sub and were
recognized as intended third-party beneficiaries hereunder) in the event of
Parents or Acquisition Subs breach of this Agreement or fraud, which right
is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Acquisition Sub and (c) with
respect to _Section 8.3(d)_, _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.8_, _Section
9.9(b)_, _Section 9.10(c)_ and _Section 9.12_, the Debt Financing Sources.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 9.15_
without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in
such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 9.15_ without notice or liability to any
other person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may
represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with
particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto.
Accordingly, persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in

 



      
 

 



 

accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of laws provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including
failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder to consummate
this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity in any such event and prior to
the valid exercise of any termination right by the parties in accordance with
_Section 8.1_. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at law or that any award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or the Financing and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the Financing shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not be
entitled to specific performance or any other equitable relief in order to
cause Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Offer or the Merger or
cause the Equity Financing to be funded (whether under this Agreement or the
Equity Commitment Letter) unless:

 



 

(i) all conditions in _Annex I_ or _Section 7.1_ (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Offer Closing or Merger
Closing, as applicable, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at
the Offer Closing or Merger Closing, as applicable) have been satisfied or
waived;

 



 

(ii) Parent and Acquisition Sub have failed to complete the Merger Closing by
the date the Merger Closing is required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.2_;

 



 

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or the Lenders have irrevocably
confirmed to Parent in writing that the Debt Financing will be funded at the
Offer Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded); and

 



 

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing and the Equity
Financing are funded, then the Offer Closing or Merger Closing, as applicable,
will occur.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and to
the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the State of
Delaware, for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in the
negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect to
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in any
Delaware state or federal court.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal
delivery of copies of such process to such party and nothing in this _Section
9.10_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, any other court of the State
of Delaware and any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in the
event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or the Transactions, (iii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iv) agrees that
it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in
any court other than the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if (but only if) the
Delaware Court of Chancery shall be unavailable, any other court of the State
of Delaware or any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). Each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any
action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal
court, and that the provisions of _Section 9.12_ relating to the waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a .pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS

 



      
 

 



 

AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, ACQUISITION SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.

 



 

Section 9.13 _Disclosure Letters_. All capitalized terms not defined in the
Disclosure Schedules shall have the meanings assigned to them in this
Agreement. The disclosure set forth in a partys disclosure letter shall
provide an exception to or otherwise qualify (a) the representations and
warranties of such party contained in the section or subsection of this
Agreement corresponding by number to such disclosure and (b) the other
representations and warranties of such party in this Agreement to the extent
it is reasonably apparent from a plain reading of such disclosure that such
disclosure is applicable to such other representations and warranties. The
listing of any matter on a partys Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to
constitute an admission by such party, or to otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material, is required to be disclosed by such party under this
Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards
set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in a partys Disclosure Schedule
relating to any possible breach or violation by such party of any contract or
Law shall be construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or
violation exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of
any matter in a partys Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand
the scope of such partys representations, warranties and/or covenants set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 9.14 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time before or after the Offer Closing shall have
occurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Offer Closing, there shall
be no amendment that decreases the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration;
_provided_ , _further_ , that _Section 6.6_ (solely with respect to the Go-
Shop Period), _Section 8.3(d)_, _Section 9.5_, _Section 9.8_, _Section
9.9(b)_, _Section 9.10(c)_ and _Section 9.12_ shall not be amended in a
manner materially adverse to the Debt Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Debt Financing Sources. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

 



 

Section 9.15 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 9.14_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall only be valid if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company,
Parent or Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 



 

Section 9.16 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.13_ and
_Section 8.3(e)_, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and

not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

We refer to [ ***** ](1).

 



 

The Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") with KSTW Holdings, Inc. and KSTW Acquisition, Inc., an entity
wholly-owned by KSTW Holdings, Inc. The Special Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Special Committee") has recommended to the
Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") that the Company waive any
"standstill" provisions applicable to [Third Party] for the sole purpose of
entertaining any interest [Third Party] may have in a possible Transaction (as
defined below). In accordance with the requirements of Section 6.6(i) of the
Merger Agreement [and the []], we hereby notify you that the Board has
approved (i) [Third Party] (or an affiliate) making an offer [language to be
tailored to the standstill obligation] (a "Transaction") whereby [Third Party]
would acquire the Company. In addition, in accordance with Section 35 of the
Rights Agreement, we hereby confirm that for purposes of the Rights Agreement
[and reference to standstill provision if applicable], neither [Insert Names]
nor any other person (or their respective Affiliates and Associates, each as
defined in the Rights Agreement) shall be deemed to be Acting in Concert (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) with the other, or to be the Beneficial Owner
of Common Shares (each as defined in the Rights Agreement) owned by the other,
by virtue of their evaluating and making such a proposal, the consideration of
such a proposal by the Board or the Special Committee or any negotiations to
enter into any agreement between the Company and [Name] to effect a
Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company does not waive or agree
to the approval under the [ ***** ] of any other proposals, offers, public
statements, stock purchases made by [Third Party] to the Company (or the
Companys shareholders, the Special Committee, the Board or any other special
committee thereof that may be designated by the Board) other than as outlined
above.

 



 

The waiver contained in this notice shall terminate upon the earliest to occur
of (1) the termination of the Merger Agreement, (2) the Offer Closing (as such
term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (3) the withdrawal of the waiver
contained in this notice by the Board by notice to [Third Party] (provided
that any such withdrawal by the Board shall not have a retroactive effect).

Sincerely, 

---|---
