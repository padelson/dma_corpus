required to be performed by them to date under each Parent Material Contract to which it is a
party, except where such failure to be binding or in full force and effect or such failure to
perform does not and is not reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except for such matters as do not and are not reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries (x)&nbsp;knows of, or has received written notice of, any breach of or violation or default
under (nor, to the knowledge of Parent, does there exist any condition which with the passage of

any such Parent Material Contract to cancel, terminate, modify or repudiate such contract or

the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not breach or violate any Parent Material Contract or permit any other party
to a Parent Material Contract to exercise rights adverse to Parent. Each Parent Material Contract
is enforceable by Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors&#146; rights and general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), except where such unenforceability is not
reasonably likely to create, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

extension, overhaul or conversion capital expenditure programs, the capital expenditures for all
such programs that were forecasted to be incurred in 2011 on a quarterly basis, as previously
provided to the Company. The construction in progress attributable to the newbuilds and included
in the consolidated balance sheet of Parent at September&nbsp;30, 2010 included in the Parent Reports
(excluding capitalized interest on such newbuilds), together with the projected capital
expenditures for such newbuilds previously provided to the Company, equal the projected total
construction costs to complete such newbuilds, as at the time of such forecast.

information is accumulated and communicated to Parent&#146;s management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications of the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports. Since January&nbsp;1, 2009, neither Parent nor its independent auditors have identified any
&#147;significant deficiencies&#148; or &#147;material weaknesses&#148; in Parent&#146;s or any of its Subsidiaries&#146;
