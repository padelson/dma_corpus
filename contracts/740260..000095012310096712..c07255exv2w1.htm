_Stockholders_ "); 

  

B. The board of directors of Acquiror, the respective board of directors and
sole member of each Merger Sub and the respective boards of directors of each
of the Companies have approved the applicable Merger(s) upon the terms and

herein; 

  

D. Pursuant to the series of transactions contemplated in the Pre-Closing
Steps Outlines between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the
Companies will (i) contribute the Company Subsidiaries which are not

thereby; 

  

F. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, each of the Parties intends that each
Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute, and is hereby
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code. 

  

Agreement 

    

The Parties hereby agree as follows: 

   

1\. _The Mergers_. 

  

(a) _The Mergers_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with Delaware Law, at the Effective Time,
(i) Atria Inc. shall be merged with and into Merger Sub A (the " _Atria
Merger_ "), with Merger Sub A as the surviving entity and a direct, wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, (ii) OLSL Inc shall be merged with and into
Merger Sub O (the " _OLSL Merger_ "), with Merger Sub O as the surviving
entity and a direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, and (iii)
Coinvestment Inc shall be merged with and into Merger Sub C (the "
_Coinvestment Merger_ "), with Merger Sub C as the surviving entity and a
direct, wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror. 

   

(b) _Closing_. 

   

(i) Subject to _Section 1(b)(ii)_, the closing of the Mergers (the "
_Closing_ ") will be held at the offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125
Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, at 10:00 a.m. (EST) on January 14,
2011, unless one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 3_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the
Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have
not been satisfied or waived by such date, in which case the Closing will be
on the third (3rd) Business Day following the date on which all of the
conditions set forth in _Section 3_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been satisfied or waived, or
at such other location, time or date as may be agreed upon in writing by the
Parties (the date on which the Closing occurs, the " _Closing Date_ ").
Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the Parties shall conduct a "pre-
closing" on the Business Day preceding the Closing Date at the same time
and location as the Closing will be held. At the Closing, each Party will
deliver the documents required to be delivered by it pursuant to _Section
3_. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) If Acquiror has directed or intends to direct any of the Companies or
Designated Subsidiaries to give notice of prepayment or defeasance of any of
the Listed Loans and the earliest permitted prepayment or defeasance date for
any of such loans falls after the then-scheduled Closing Date, then on a one-
time basis, Acquiror may, by written notice to the Stockholders at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the then scheduled Closing Date, defer the
Closing Date by up to (but not more than) twenty-five (25) Business Days
(such deferred Closing, a " _Delayed Closing_ ") as necessary to enable the
Closing Date to coincide with the prepayment or defeasance date for such
Listed Loans. In the event that Acquiror causes a Delayed Closing as
contemplated by this _Section 1(b)(ii)_, all references in this Agreement to
the Closing (except the references in the preceding sentence) shall be deemed
references to the Delayed Closing and the Closing Date shall be deemed to
occur on the date on which the Delayed Closing occurs. 

  

(c) _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Merger Subs and the Companies
shall, and Acquiror shall cause the Merger Subs and the Stockholders shall
cause the Companies to file the Certificates of Merger in accordance with
Delaware Law, and to make any other filings and recordings required under
Delaware Law. The Mergers shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ")
on the Closing Date at such time as the Certificates of Merger have been
accepted for record in accordance with Delaware Law (or at such later date
and time as may be specified in the Certificates of Merger). Each Merger
shall have the effects specified in this Agreement, the applicable
Certificate of Merger and Delaware Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing and subject to the terms of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Pre-Closing Steps Outlines, at the Effective Time, all of
the respective properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Constituent Entities shall vest in the applicable Surviving Entity, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Constituent Entities shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the applicable Surviving Entity. 

  

(d) _Constituent Documents_. The limited liability company agreement and
other constituent documents of each Merger Sub in effect at the Effective
Time shall be the constituent documents of the applicable Surviving Entity. 

   

(e) _Officers and Directors_. 

   

(i) The officers of each Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the
initial officers of the applicable Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time,
to hold office in accordance with the constituent documents of the Surviving
Entity until their successors are duly appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal. 

   

(ii) The directors of each Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall become the
directors of the applicable Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time, to
hold office in accordance with the constituent documents of the
Surviving Entity until their successors are duly elected and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

2. _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares_. 

  

(a) _Effect of Merger on Equity_. At the Effective Time by virtue of the
Mergers and without any action on the part of the Constituent Entities or
holders of any limited liability company interests or shares of beneficial
interest of the Constituent Entities: 

   

(i) The membership interests of the Merger Subs issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued, outstanding and
unchanged as validly issued membership interests of the Surviving Entities
after the Effective Time. 

   

(ii) The shares of common stock of the Companies (" _Company Common Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive, collectively and subject to adjustment
pursuant to _Section 2(c)_, (A) 24,958,543 shares of common stock, $0.25 par
value per share, of Acquiror (" _Acquiror Common Stock_ ") and (B) an amount
in cash equal to $150,000,000 (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") (the
consideration in clauses (A) and (B), as adjusted, as applicable, pursuant to
this Agreement, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Acquiror shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to the Stockholders all of the Merger Consideration on
the Closing Date, immediately following the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,
that pursuant to _Section 6_, a number of such shares of Acquiror Common
Stock equal to the quotient of (i) $200,000,000 divided by (ii) the Value Per
Share, rounded to the nearest whole number, shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent to be held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Acquiror will deliver the
components of the Merger Consideration to the Stockholders pursuant to an
allocation, and instructions, to be designated by Stockholders and delivered
to Acquiror in writing prior to the Closing;  _provided_ that such allocation
and such instructions shall be consistent with the qualification of each
Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code. 

  

(b) _Termination of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time all
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution; Dividends_. 

   

(i) If prior to Closing, as a result of any reclassification or stock split
which is made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Acquiror Common Stock ("
_Acquiror Common Stockholders_ ") there is, or a record date occurs for, a
change in the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock outstanding or
issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights
convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Acquiror Common
Stock, then the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the
Stockholders are to receive pursuant to _Section 2(a)_ shall
be correspondingly adjusted to provide the Stockholders the same economic
effect contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event(s). 

   

(ii) If prior to Closing, Acquiror pays, or a record date occurs for the
payment of, a dividend in cash or in kind on a pro rata basis to all Acquiror
Common Stockholders (other than Acquirors regular quarterly dividends, paid
at the annual rate reflected in Acquirors most recent market guidance, as
the same may be increased or reduced by Acquiror from time to time, which
dividends are expressly excluded from this adjustment provision), then at
Closing Acquiror will pay to the Stockholders an amount equal to the
aggregate amount that the Stockholders would have received in respect of all
such dividends if the Stockholders had been Acquiror Common Stockholders on
the record date for each such dividend (to be paid in cash or in the same
form as the dividend that was paid to the actual Acquiror Common
Stockholders) based on the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that the
Stockholders are to receive pursuant to _Section 2(a)_. If Acquiror
decides to pay the Stockholders in cash for a dividend in kind pursuant to
the above sentences in this paragraph and there is a disagreement concerning
the valuation of the in-kind dividend, the Parties will meet promptly to
review the basis of the disagreement and will endeavor, in good faith, to
resolve the disagreement. If the Parties, nevertheless, are unable to resolve
the disagreement promptly, either of Acquiror or the Stockholders will
be entitled to submit the matter for binding arbitration in accordance with
the provisions of  _Section 8(p)_ below. 

  

(d) _Merger Consideration Adjustment at Closing_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the Stockholders have delivered to Acquiror a schedule of
projected Net Debt amounts (the " _Net Debt Statement_ ") attached hereto as
_Exhibit E_. The Net Debt Statement sets forth projections for Net Debt of
the Companies and the Designated Subsidiaries on a pro forma basis (presented
as if they were one consolidated entity) for each month during the time period
beginning on October 1, 2010 and ending on December 31, 2011. At least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Stockholders will prepare
and deliver to Acquiror a statement in a form consistent with the example set
forth in _Exhibit E_ (the " _Estimated Closing Net Debt Statement_ ")
setting forth the Stockholders good faith estimate of the Net Debt as of the
close of business on the last day of the calendar month preceding the month
in which the Closing occurs (the " _Estimated Net Debt_ ") for the Companies
and the Designated Subsidiaries (presented as if they were one consolidated
entity). Without limiting any other rights and remedies that may
be applicable, in the event of a breach of any covenant set forth in clause
(y) in _Section 5(a)(i)_ that would otherwise reduce the Net Debt as of such
day, the Estimated Net Debt shall be calculated as though such breach had not
occurred. If the Estimated Net Debt amount exceeds, or falls short, of the
corresponding Net Debt amount on the Net Debt Statement, the Merger
Consideration will be increased or decreased, as applicable, by
the incremental amount of that excess or shortfall. Any increase in the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the previous sentence of this _Section
2(d)_ will be paid by Acquiror to the Stockholders in cash and allocated
among the Stockholders in accordance with the allocation method set forth in 
_Section 2(a)(ii)_. Any decrease in the Merger Consideration as described in
the third to last sentence of this _Section 2(d)_ shall decrease the number
of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which the Stockholders are entitled at
Closing, and the number of such shares to be decreased shall be equal to the
amount of such decrease in the Merger Consideration divided by the Value Per
Share, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(e) _Post-Closing Merger Consideration Adjustment_. 

   

(i) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, the Stockholders shall
prepare and deliver to Acquiror an update of the Estimated Closing Net Debt
Statement (the " _Post-Closing Net Debt Statement_ ") setting forth the Net
Debt of the Companies and the Designated Subsidiaries (presented as if they
were one consolidated entity as of immediately following Closing) as of 11:59
p.m (EST) on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date (Net
Debt, as it may be adjusted pursuant to this _Section 2(e)_, the " _Final
Closing Net Debt_ "). Without limiting any other rights and remedies that may
be applicable, in the event of a breach of any covenant set forth in clause
(y) of  _Section 5(a)(i)_ that would otherwise reduce the Final Closing Net
Debt as of such day, the Final Closing Net Debt shall be calculated as though
such breach had not occurred. Acquiror agrees to provide the Stockholders and
their representatives with reasonable access to the properties and books and
records of each of Surviving Entities and the Designated Subsidiaries and the
personnel responsible therefor or otherwise involved in the preparation
thereof and otherwise to cooperate with the Stockholders and
their representatives as they may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of the Post-Closing Net Debt Statement. 

   

(ii) The Post-Closing Net Debt Statement will become final and binding upon
the Parties at 5:00 p.m. (EST) on the thirtieth (30th) day following
the Stockholders delivery thereof unless Acquiror gives the Stockholders
written notice of a good faith disagreement with any amount or computation
thereof (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") prior to such date and time. The
Notice of Disagreement shall set forth Acquirors good faith determination of
the Final Closing Net Debt and specify, in reasonable detail, the nature of
any disagreement with the Stockholders determination. If a Notice of
Disagreement is received by the Stockholders in a timely manner, the Post-
Closing Net Debt Statement (as adjusted, as applicable, pursuant to this 
_Section 2(e)_ to reflect final resolution of differences, if any, between
the Parties) will become final and binding upon the Parties as of the
_earlier of_ (x) the date on which the Parties resolve in writing all
differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice
of Disagreement and (y) the date on which all such differences are resolved
by a determination of the Accountants as described in clause (iii) below. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) During the thirty (30) day period following the receipt of the Notice
of Disagreement, the Stockholders and Acquiror shall seek in good faith to
resolve the matter(s) specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, by the
expiry of that thirty-day period, the Stockholders and Acquiror have not
reached an agreement on all such matters then, within ten (10) Business Days
from the end of the thirty-day period, the Parties shall submit all matters
that remain in dispute (the " _Dispute_ ") to the Accountants for sole and
final review and resolution as the Accountants determine to be
appropriate. With respect to each disputed item or amount, the Accountants
shall adopt a position that is equal to Acquirors proposed position, equal
to the Stockholders proposed position, or between the positions proposed by
Acquiror and the Stockholders. The Accountants shall establish the process of
reviewing any Dispute, but shall be directed by the Parties to provide their
final determination with respect to any Dispute as soon as practicable and
in any event within thirty (30) days following the date on which the Dispute
is first submitted to the Accountants pursuant to this _Section 2(e)_ for
their consideration. Each Party agrees to promptly make available to each
other and to the Accountants all documents, books, records and personnel
under that Partys control as the Accountants shall determine in their
judgment to be necessary or relevant to their review of the Dispute
and otherwise to cooperate with the other parties and the Accountants to
facilitate a prompt resolution of the Dispute; _provided_ that nothing
contained in this  _Section 2(e)_ shall require a Party to disclose any
attorney-client privileged information to the extent that the disclosure
thereof may result in the loss of attorney-client privilege by such Party. 

   

(iv) If Final Closing Net Debt is different from the projected Net Debt amount
as of the Closing Date (determined based on the Net Debt Statement in
accordance with _Exhibit E_ ), then the Merger Consideration will be adjusted
following the Closing (the Merger Consideration following such adjustment,
the " _Final Merger Consideration_ ") and Acquiror or the Stockholders, as
applicable, will pay to the other the aggregate amount of the excess or
shortfall (after giving full credit for any adjustments made to the
Merger Consideration in respect of Net Debt at Closing pursuant to _Section
2(d)_). Any payment to the Stockholders described in this _Section 2(e)(iv)_
shall be made by Acquiror to the Stockholders in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the Stockholders
promptly and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date on which
the Post-Closing Net Debt Statement became final (and allocated among the
Stockholders in accordance with the allocation method set forth in
_Section 2(a)(ii)_ ). In the event of any delay in payment by Acquiror of the
amount required by this _Section 2(e)(iv)_ beyond five (5) Business Days
after the Post-Closing Net Debt Statement became final, the Stockholders also
will be entitled to receive interest on the unpaid amount from such fifth
Business Day at 10% per annum, compounding monthly, until all amounts owing
hereunder have been paid in full. Any payment to Acquiror as described in the
first sentence of this  _Section 2(e)(iv)_ shall be effected by Acquiror
canceling the applicable number of  shares of its common stock (determined
based on the Value Per Share, rounded to the nearest whole number of shares)
that it delivered to the Stockholders at Closing.

(f) _Accounting Principles_. In preparing the foregoing statements and
resolving any Dispute, the Parties (and, in the case of any Dispute, the
Accountants) shall follow the Accounting Principles in effect as of the date
of this Agreement and the same policies and procedures used in preparing the

below) of the Facilities on the Measurement Date (defined below) minus (ii)
the amount that Acquiror would need to receive on the Measurement Date (as the
residual value of the Facilities component of the definition of " _Facilities
Cash Flow_ " below) to achieve a 7% IRR on Total Investment (defined
below). 

   

(i) The term " _Acquiror s EBITDA_" means, with respect to any given
period, Acquirors Net Income prior to deduction of minority interests, as
set forth in Acquirors audited financial statements disclosed in Acquirors
annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, adjusted as follows:

interest expenses (including discontinued operations interest), depreciation
and amortization expenses (including stock-based compensation amortization
and discontinued operations depreciation and amortization), and income and
other tax expenses; 

   

(B) adjust for pro forma effect of acquisitions and divestitures (i.e., as
if the acquisition or divestiture had occurred at the beginning of the period
during which such acquisition or disposition occurred); 

   

(C) exclude from Acquirors EBITDA (i.e., adjust Net Income as required
to account for) any gains and losses on real estate divestitures, gains and
losses on extinguishment of debt (including prepayment premiums and discounts
on debt repayment), merger-related expenses and deal costs and expenses
(including transition and integration costs and expenses), litigation
settlements and proceeds, and other non-recurring items. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) The term " _Acquiror s Enterprise Value_" means the sum of (a) the
product of (1) the shares of Acquiror Common Stock outstanding (on a fully-
diluted basis and including all vested options that are in the money and
partnership units in Acquirors operating partnership and other convertible
instruments) as of the Measurement Date and (2) the trailing 45-day volume-
weighted average closing sale price (regular way) of a share of Acquirors
common stock as of the Measurement Date as reported on the NYSE (as published
in  _The Wall Street Journal_ ), (b) Acquirors net debt (including
indebtedness set forth on Acquirors balance sheet, Acquirors pro rata share
of joint venture debt, capital lease obligations and preferred securities at
liquidation preference, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash
and escrow deposits) as of the Measurement Date and (c) the value of non-
controlling equity interests held by Acquiror. 

   

(iii) The term " _Deemed Liquidation Value of the Facilities_ " means, as of
the Measurement Date, the difference of (A) the product of (x) the Facilities
EBITDA for the calendar year in which the Measurement Date occurs and (y) the
multiple obtained by dividing Acquirors Enterprise Value as of the
Measurement Date by Acquirors EBITDA for the calendar year in which the
Measurement Date occurs, minus (B) deemed liquidation costs equal to 1.5% of
the amount determined in (A) above. 

   

(iv) The term " _Facilities Cash Flow_ " means, for the period in question,
the sum of (i) the Facilities EBITDA for such period, reduced by any and all
capital expenditures related to the Facilities paid during such period and

Damages suffered with respect to the Facilities to the extent that such
Damages did not reduce the Facilities EBITDA and were not otherwise included
in capital expenditures or operating expenses, (ii) net proceeds from the
divestiture of any Facility(ies) during such period, and (iii) the residual

Expenses of the Facilities for such period (in each case as determined
pursuant to the definition of such terms in the Master Agreement), adjusted
for cash rents (whether related to ground or space leases), management fees,
and non-recurring items as reasonably determined by the Stockholders and
reasonably approved by Acquiror, and pro forma for the timing of divestitures

    ##### 

  

   

(vi) The term " _IRR on Total Investment_ " means that certain interest rate
that, when used as a discount rate, causes (a) the net present value (as of
the Closing Date) of the Facilities Cash Flow from the Closing Date through
the Measurement Date, to equal (b) the Total Investment. For purposes of this
definition, the internal rate of return shall be determined using annual
compounding periods, computed annually. The calculation of IRR on Total
Investment is equivalent to the calculation of "internal rate of return" or
"IRR" pursuant to Microsoft Excel 2010. Any amounts received by Acquiror
shall be treated for purposes of these calculations as having been received
on the day actually received by Acquiror. 

   

(vii) The term " _Measurement Date_ " means either December 31, 2014

(viii) The term " _Total Investment_ " means the sum of (i) the Final
Merger Consideration, after taking into account closing adjustments and
amounts, if any, paid pursuant to the indemnity provisions of _Section 6_,
plus (ii) Net Debt immediately prior to Closing (but assuming that the
separation of Management Holdco, including any contribution to Management
Holdco in accordance with the transactions described in the Stockholders
Pre-Closing Steps Outline, had occurred prior to such time). 

   

(ix) No later than thirty (30) days after the applicable Measurement Date, or,
if the Measurement Date is December 31, 2014, the date that the Stockholders
Designee notifies Acquiror of such Measurement Date, the Stockholders
Designee shall deliver to Acquiror the determination of the Stockholders
Designee of the Facilities EBITDA for the calendar year in which the
applicable Measurement Date occurred, which determination shall be
certified by the Chief Executive Office and Chief Financial Officer of
Management Holdco and a senior representative of the Stockholders to be true
and complete to the best of their respective knowledge (the " _Company EBITDA
Determination_ "). 

   

(x) No later than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Company EBITDA
Determination subject to such reasonable extensions as Acquiror may require
to gather such additional information as it may require to confirm the
Company EBITDA Determination, not to exceed an additional thirty (30) days,
or in the event of a disagreement pursuant to clause (xi) below, Acquiror
shall deliver to the Stockholders Designee its calculation of the Additional
Payment, together with a reasonably detailed description of the calculation
of such Additional Payment. The Stockholders Designee will cooperate with
Acquiror in its efforts to compute the Additional Payment, including by
providing such information, including relating to the Facilities EBITDA, as
Acquiror may reasonably request to enable it to prepare the calculation.
Acquirors calculation of the Additional Payment will become final and
binding upon the Parties at 5:00 p.m. (EST) on the thirtieth (30th) day
following Acquirors delivery thereof unless the Stockholders Designee
notifies Acquiror in writing of a disagreement with respect thereto prior to
such date and time. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(xi) In the event of any disagreement concerning the calculation of the
Company EBITDA Determination or the Additional Payment, Acquiror and the
Stockholders Designee will meet promptly to review the basis of the
disagreement and will endeavor, in good faith, to resolve the disagreement.
If Acquiror and the Stockholders Designee, nevertheless, are unable to
resolve the disagreement within 30 days after one party notifies the other
in writing of such disagreement, either of Acquiror or the Stockholders
Designee will be entitled to submit the matter for binding arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of  _Section 8(p)_ below. The Parties confirm
that they have developed, and exchanged between them, an agreed sample
calculation of the Additional Payment that provides more detail as to the
individual components of the foregoing calculation, and that the
sample calculation will be deemed to govern in the case of any disagreement
between the Parties as to an aspect of the calculation described above if and
to the extent addressed in that sample. 

   

(xii) Acquiror will pay the Additional Payment (if any) to the Stockholders or
their permitted assignees in immediately available funds promptly following
the _earlier of_ (A) the date that Acquirors calculation of the Additional
Payment becomes final and binding upon the Parties pursuant to clause (x)
above, (B) the date on which Acquiror and the Stockholders Designee resolve
in writing all disagreements with respect to the calculation of the
Additional Payment and (C) the completion of binding arbitration
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 8(p)_ below with respect to
the calculation of the Additional Payment (the earlier of clauses (A), (B)
and (C), the " _Payment Date_ "). 

   

(xiii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Stockholder and
its permitted assignees may (i) distribute all or a portion of its interest
in the Additional Payment to its direct or indirect members, partners or
other equity holders, (ii) sell, transfer or otherwise assign all or a
portion of its interest to another Stockholder or to any other entity that is
controlled, directly or indirectly, by Lazard Alternative Investments LLC or
a successor to all or substantially all of its business (" _LAI_ "), or by
Lazard Group LLC or a successor to all or substantially all of its
business (" _Lazard Group_ "), or to a fund managed by a controlled affiliate
of either of the foregoing, or (iii) contribute, sell, transfer or otherwise
assign all or a portion of its interest in the Additional Payment to
Management Holdco for (x) retention by Management Holdco, (y) contribution by
Management Holdco to one or more of its Subsidiaries that serves as an
employer and/or (z) delivery by Management Holdco to employees
as compensation. As used herein, the " _Stockholders  Designee_" means,
initially, the Stockholders acting together, and, in the future, such Persons
designated by the Stockholders to Acquiror in writing from time to time to
represent all of the Stockholders and assignees of any interest in the
Additional Payment in the manner described above. Unless otherwise approved
by Acquiror, acting reasonably, any replacement Stockholders Designee must
be LAI or Lazard Group or an Affiliate or either of them. Acquiror shall have
no obligation to interact with any parties other than the Stockholders, the
Stockholders Designee and Management Holdco in connection with the matters
described in this paragraph. 

   

(xiv) In no event will the Additional Payment exceed the amount set forth on 
_Schedule 2(g)(xiv)_.

presently conducted. Each of the Companies is duly registered or otherwise
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in

to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified does not have
a Material Adverse Effect. The Stockholders and the Companies have all

hereby. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
each Stockholders and each Company and, assuming due authorization, execution

valid and binding obligation of each Stockholder and each
Company, enforceable against each Stockholder and each Company in accordance

insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity. Each agreement and other
instrument to be delivered by the Stockholders and/or their Subsidiaries at
Closing pursuant to _Section 3(a)_ will be duly authorized, executed and
delivered by such party and, assuming due authorization, execution and
delivery of the agreement by the other parties thereto (other than the
Stockholders and their Affiliates), will constitute a valid and binding
obligation of the Stockholders and their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, enforceable against the Stockholders and their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(B) The board of directors of each Company (in an action by unanimous
written consent) has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Mergers, are advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of, such Company and its stockholder (ii) adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the plan of
merger contained in this Agreement and (iii) directed that this Agreement be
submitted to the stockholder of the Company for its approval.

material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be, as and to the extent applicable thereto,

Acquiror, threatened against Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries in any court

Acquiror, except as disclosed in the Acquiror SEC Documents filed as of the
date hereof, neither Acquiror nor any Subsidiary thereof has been
specifically identified as a party subject to restrictions or limitations of
any material nature in any judgment, order or decree of any

each other party thereto in accordance with its terms, except for such

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. None of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of Acquiror, any other party thereto, is
in material breach or violation of, or default under, any Acquiror Material
Contract, and no event has occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a violation, breach or default under any Acquiror Material
Contract, except where in each case such breach, violation or default is
not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, an Acquiror
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, none of Acquiror
or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of an event of
default pursuant to the terms of any Acquiror Material Contract, specifically
excluding, for this purpose, any notice of an alleged event of default which

"tail" coverage, effective as of the Closing, with respect to claims
made during such six-year period alleging Events or Medical Incidents (as
defined in the Existing PL/GL Policies) prior to Closing of a type that would
have been covered by the PL/GL policies currently issued by RCI Insurance
Company, Charles Channel Indemnity Inc. or Mystic River Insurance Inc. (the "
_Existing PL/GL Policies_ ") as well as the umbrella/excess liability
policies currently issued by Lloyds of London, as if such policies had
continued in effect during the tail period (" _PL/GL Covered Claims_ ").
Additionally, the Stockholders are responsible for causing Management Holdco
to maintain the insurance reserves in an amount equal to the reserves that
are currently being maintained by the Companies or Company Subsidiaries as of

to purchase, at the Companies cost and expense, for the express benefit of
each Company and Designated Subsidiary and all persons who are covered by

identified as a continuing additional insured with rights of direct payment),
a pre-paid irrevocable six-year "tail" directors and officers insurance
policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to Closing, on terms

directors and officers insurance policies. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) _Access_. 

   

(A) Prior to the Closing, the Stockholders will, and will cause the

surveys, inspections, engineering studies and Phase I environmental
assessments with respect to the Facilities (collectively, the " _Inspections_

Confidentiality Agreement. Acquiror may only conduct Inspections during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to the Stockholders

except as set forth in _Section 5(a)(iii)_ of the Stockholders Disclosure
Schedule, the Stockholders shall have the right, without limitation, to
disapprove any and all entries, Inspections and other matters that in the
Stockholders reasonable judgment could result in any injury to any of
the Facilities or the Real Property or breach of any contract, or expose
any Stockholder, Company or Designated Subsidiary to any losses or violation
of applicable Law, or otherwise adversely affect any of the Facilities or the
Real Property or any interest therein, and Acquiror shall obtain the
Stockholders prior written consent to any such entries, Inspections or other

discretion and which may be conditioned, among other things, on Acquirors
and/or Acquirors Representatives delivery to the Stockholders of evidence
of insurance additional to that described in  _Section 5(a)(iii)(D)_ below.
Acquiror shall coordinate with the Stockholders to conduct any Inspection in
a manner that complies with all applicable Laws and regulations and does not
cause or result in any disruption or damage of any material nature at any of
the Facilities, any loss or expense or undue burden of any material nature on
any of the residents, invitees or guests at each of the Facilities or
disturbance or interference of any material nature with any of the activities
of any of the residents, invitees or guests at each of the Facilities or the
Real Property. Acquiror shall coordinate with the Stockholders to minimize
disruption to residents, invitees and guests at each of the Facilities and
the Real Property in connection with Acquirors or Acquirors
Representatives activities pursuant to this _Section 5(a)(iii)_. No consent
by the Stockholders to any such activity shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver or assumption of liability or risk by the Stockholders. Acquiror
hereby agrees to repair, at Acquirors sole cost and expense, any damage
caused by Acquiror or Acquirors Representatives to any of the Facilities or
the Real Property so that such Facilities are or Real Property is restored to
the same condition existing immediately prior to Acquirors exercise of its
rights pursuant to this _Section 5(a)(iii)_. In addition, Acquiror or
Acquirors Representatives shall provide the Stockholders advance notice
before communicating with any Governmental Authority concerning any of the
Facilities or Real Property or any aspect thereof and shall provide the
Stockholders or their representatives the opportunity to participate in any
such communications.

located and having a rating of at least "AX" by A.M. Best Company,
with limits of at least $1,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence for
bodily or personal injury or death, for property damage and loss of use
thereof. Such insurance coverage shall: (i) be primary and any insurance
maintained by the Stockholders or its Affiliates shall be excess and
noncontributory, and (ii) include contractual liability coverage with respect
to Acquirors indemnity obligations set forth below (it being understood,
however, that the availability of such insurance shall not serve to limit or
define the scope of Acquirors indemnity obligations under  _Section
5(a)(iii)(F)_ in any manner whatsoever). Such certificate(s) shall also
provide that the coverage may not be cancelled, non-renewed or reduced
without at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice to the Stockholders.
Acquiror and/or Acquirors Representatives shall also maintain statutory
workers compensation insurance in the amounts required by applicable statute
and employers liability coverage of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence. In

Representatives hereunder.

all actions taken in connection with the Inspections or other matters
performed by or on behalf of Acquiror with respect to the Facilities or the
Real Property, and all equipment, materials and substances generated, used or
brought onto any of the Facilities or the Real Property pose no material
threat to the safety of persons or the environment and cause no damage to any
of the Facilities, the Real Property or other property of the Stockholders or
other persons. Acquiror shall, at no cost to the Stockholders, deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Stockholders copies of all reports, studies or
assessments relating to any inspections and of any tests conducted at, or
involving samples from, any of the Facilities or the Real Property by
Acquiror or Acquirors Representatives at the same time received by

Representatives, and any Inspections or other matters performed by Acquiror

to cause the Companies and the Designated Subsidiaries not to have, any
employees, directors or consultants as of the Closing and not to maintain,
sponsor or have any current or contingent obligations or duties with respect

Stockholders shall transfer or cause to be transferred to Management Holdco

Benefit Plan or any employment, consultancy, or directorship relationship
between any individual, on the one hand, and any Company or any of the
Designated Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates (other than an Acquiror
Employee), on the other hand (collectively, " _Employee Liabilities_ ") and,
from and after the Closing, none of the Companies or Designated Subsidiaries
shall have responsibility for any Employee Liabilities. For purposes
of clarity, there are no third-party beneficiaries of this _Section
5(a)(v)_. For so long as they control Management Holdco, the Stockholders
will cause Management Holdco to not waive or materially diminish any
confidentiality restrictions and requirements contained in any employment
agreement, or any other agreement, between Management Holdco or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Covered Executive (as defined in the Retention
Program (defined below)). 

   

(vi) _Retention and Incentive Program_. The Stockholders will cause
Management Holdco to adopt, no later than the Closing, the incentive and
retention program (the " _Retention Program_ ") outlined in the document
referred to as the "Executives Schedule" appended to the executed employment
agreement between Management Holdco and Mr. John A. Moore, including Annex B
thereto (a copy of which has been delivered to Acquiror concurrently herewith
pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 4(a)(xvi)_). The Stockholders
further agree that, prior to the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary
of Closing and (ii) the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

termination of the Master Agreement or all of the Facility Management
Agreements, Management Holdco will not make any Specified Change (as defined
below) in the Retention Program in a manner that adversely impacts in any
material respect the alignment that those features create between the
employee beneficiaries, on the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other
hand, without Acquirors approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). As used herein, Specified Change means any
of the following changes to the Retention Program: (i) removing an individual
from the list of Covered Executives (as such term is defined in the Retention
Program) eligible to participate in the Retention Program at a time that such
individual is still an employee, (ii) any change in the allocation of
a Covered Executives Investment Amount (as such term is defined in the
Retention Program) between Management Holdco and Acquiror stock, (iii) any
change in the applicable formula that will result in a material reduction in
the amount of the "Equity Match" or "Additional Payment Match" (as each such
term is defined in the Retention Program) available to a Covered Executive
under the Retention Program, (iv) any change in the percentage of
the Additional Payment allocated to Management Holdco and its Subsidiaries to
less than 25%, (v) acceleration of the vesting, payment or settlement of the
Equity Match or the Additional Payment Match other than as specifically set
forth in the Retention Program and (vi) changes in the Management Companys
call rights over Management Company stock held by the Covered Executives,
other than in the case of an individually negotiated settlement in connection
with the termination of employment of a particular Covered Executive. 

   

(vii) _Financing Cooperation_. The Stockholders agree to cause the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to, cooperate with Acquiror, at
Acquirors sole cost, in connection with Acquirors financing of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement, all as reasonably requested by
Acquiror, and in each case provided that such requested cooperation does not
interfere in any material respect with the Stockholders efforts to prepare
for Closing or with the ongoing operations of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries. Such cooperation may include, among other things, (A)
participating in meetings, presentations, road shows, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, (B) furnishing Acquiror
and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information
regarding the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably
requested by Acquiror, (C) cooperating with Acquiror and its financing
sources in their activities relating to the preparation of any
offering document for any such financing to be raised to complete the
transactions contemplated hereby, materials for rating agency presentations,
and any similar documents, (D) forming, effective at Closing, or as promptly
as practicable prior to Closing, additional entities to serve as direct
and/or indirect Subsidiaries of any of the Companies or
Designated Subsidiaries, (E) executing documents as may be reasonably
requested by Acquiror, provided that such agreements 

 

    ##### 

  

   

are not effective until concurrent with or immediately following Closing and
do not and will not result in any actual or potential liability to any of the
Stockholders, Management Holdco or any of the Management Subsidiaries or any
the foregoing entities Affiliates (other than the Companies and
the Designated Subsidiaries), (F) requesting, and using commercially
reasonable efforts, at Acquirors sole cost and expense, to obtain, estoppel
certificates from landlords and other third parties (it being understood and
agreed by Acquiror that receipt of any such requested estoppel certificates
is not a condition of Closing), and (G) cooperating with Acquirors efforts
in connection with the repayment or defeasance of any indebtedness of the
Companies or any of the Designated Subsidiaries as of the Closing, including
delivering (and/or revoking if not prohibited by terms of the applicable
agreement) such payoff, defeasance or similar notices under any existing
mortgage or mezzanine loans of the Companies or any Designated Subsidiary as
reasonably requested by Acquiror (it being understood and agreed, by
Acquiror, that if the Companies and Company Subsidiaries deliver any such
notice and Acquiror subsequently fails to repay, defease or take whatever
other action was required as a result of the notice having been given, within
the timeframe therefor under the relevant documents, and the failure was not
caused by a breach by the Stockholders of any material obligation required of
any of them pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then Acquiror will
indemnify the Stockholders, the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries from
and against all fees, costs and expenses resulting from the giving of the
notice and/or the failure to act, and, if the underlying loan
obligation becomes due and payable prior to its scheduled maturity Acquiror
further will provide or arrange for, at Acquirors sole cost, substitute
financing on terms no less favorable to the Stockholders and the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries and Management Holdco and its Subsidiaries.
Acquiror confirms that none of the Stockholders or the Companies or
any Company Subsidiary shall be required to incur or pay any commitment or
other similar fee or incur or pay any other cost or expense not reimbursable
by Acquiror hereunder, or incur any liability in connection with such
financing or any of the foregoing. Acquiror shall, promptly upon request by
the Stockholders, reimburse the Stockholders for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs, including professional fees and expenses, incurred by the
Stockholders and their representatives in connection with such cooperation.
Acquiror shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders and their
representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of any
repayment, defeasance or replacement financing and the other activities
described above. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
limitations set forth in _Section 6_ shall not apply to Acquirors
obligations under this _Section 5(a)(vii)_, and Acquirors obligations under
this _Section 5(a)(vii)_ shall survive a termination of this Agreement. For
purposes of clarity, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Acquiror agrees that its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby is not subject to any condition relating to financing. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(viii) _No Negotiations with Others_. Until the Closing or the
earlier termination of this Agreement, the Stockholders will not, will cause
LAI and its Subsidiaries (the " _LAI Affiliates_ ") to not, and will direct
its and their representatives to not, and cause the LAI Affiliates to direct
their representatives to not, directly or indirectly, without the written
consent of Acquiror, initiate discussions or engage in negotiations
concerning, or discuss, with any Person other than Acquiror and its
representatives, any proposal regarding the acquisition of, or any other
extraordinary transaction with respect to, any of the Companies or their
respective assets or businesses;  _provided_ , that, without limitation to
the restriction set forth in _Section 5(a)(i)_ , this  _Section 5(a)(viii)_
shall not prohibit the Stockholders, the Companies, the Company Subsidiaries,
the LAI Affiliates and their respective representatives from initiating
discussions or engaging in negotiations concerning the sale of any individual
Facility or group of up to ten (10) related Facilities in connection
with Stockholders obligations pursuant to _Section 5(c)(i)_. 

   

(ix) _No Hedging_. The Stockholders shall not, and will cause the
LAI Affiliates to not, enter into any contract, arrangement, understanding or
relationship which gives any of them the economic equivalent of ownership of
Acquiror Common Stock due to the fact that the value of the derivative is
explicitly determined by reference to the price or value of Acquiror Common
Stock or of any interest therein, or otherwise enter into a derivative or
hedging transaction with respect to Acquiror Common Stock. 

   

(x) _Reorganization Status of Mergers_. Neither the Stockholders nor any
of their respective Affiliates shall take any action or knowingly fail to
take any action, which action or failure to act could reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede any of the Mergers from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. 

   

(xi) _Stockholder Consents_. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, the Stockholders shall execute and deliver to the Companies
duly executed and valid written consents (the " _Stockholder Consents_ ")
adopting this Agreement and approving the Mergers and the other transactions
set forth herein. 

   

(b) _Covenants of Acquiror_. 

   

(i) _Confidentiality Agreement_. Acquiror acknowledges that the
information being provided to it and/or Acquirors Representatives by or on
behalf of the Stockholders is subject to the terms of its Confidentiality
Agreement with the Stockholders and/or their Affiliates (as modified by
_Section 5(c)(vii)_ below), the terms of which are incorporated herein by
reference in their entirety. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) _D andO Indemnification_. 

   

(A) Acquiror agrees that for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
(x) it will cause the Surviving Entities and the Designated Subsidiaries to
continue to indemnify and hold harmless, and to provide rights to the
advancement of expenses to, in each case on terms at least as favorable as
those in existence as of the date of this Agreement in their respective
certificates of incorporation, certificates of formation, certificates of
limited partnership, bylaws, limited liability company agreements, limited
partnership agreements or other organizational documents, as applicable, each
present and former director, officer or manager (or equivalent) (each, a "
_Covered Person_ ") of the Companies and the Designated Subsidiaries against
any Damages, arising out of or pertaining to matters arising, occurring or
otherwise existing prior to or at the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing and (y) it will not, and will not permit
the Surviving Entities or Designated Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any organizational document providing such rights to
any Covered Person in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of
any such Covered Person thereunder following the Closing, unless the
alteration or modification of such document is required by applicable Law or
each Covered Person affected thereby otherwise consents in writing thereto.
Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Entities and the Designated Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to advance expenses to a Covered Person in connection with
such Covered Persons defense of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation within thirty (30) days after receiving a request for such
advance from such Covered Person. 

   

(B) In the event that Acquiror, any Surviving Entity or any
Designated Subsidiary or any successor or assign of any of them (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity as a result of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any
Person, Acquiror agrees to require, and cause the Surviving Entities and/or
the Designated Subsidiaries, as applicable, to require, such Person to assume
the obligations set forth in this  _Section 5(b)(ii)_. 

   

(C) This _Section 5(b)(ii)_ shall survive the Closing and is intended
to benefit the Covered Persons, each of whom is an expressly intended third-
party beneficiary and may enforce the provisions of this _Section
5(b)(ii)_ directly. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iii) _Contact with Certain Parties_. Subject to the exceptions in
the Confidentiality Agreement and to _Section 5(a)(iii)_, Acquiror agrees
that, prior to Closing, it will not, directly or through any of Acquirors
Representatives, contact or communicate with any employees, customers,
vendors or suppliers of any Company, any Company Subsidiary or Management
Holdco or any of its Subsidiaries or any resident, or a guest of any
resident, of any Facility, whether in person, in writing, by telephone
or otherwise, without the Stockholders prior written consent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, and unless it has provided the
Stockholders with reasonable advance notice of such contact or communication
and an opportunity to be present and participate in any such discussions or
to review and approve any such written submission in advance;  _provided_ ,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Acquiror and Acquirors
Representatives shall not be prohibited from communicating with any of
the customers, vendors or suppliers to the extent that such communication is
in the ordinary course of Acquirors business and does not relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

(iv) _Pre-Closing Consolidation and Management Company Spinoff
Transactions_. Acquiror will cooperate with the Stockholders and the
Companies, the Company Subsidiaries and Management Holdco and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, to consummate each of the transactions
contemplated in the Stockholders Pre-Closing Steps Outline and
Acquirors Pre-Closing Steps Outline. 

   

(v) _Change of Names of Designated Subsidiaries_. As soon as practicable
after the Closing, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the Closing
Date, Acquiror will take such steps as are appropriate to rename each of the
Designated Subsidiaries to remove (or not include) any of the words "Atria",
"Atria Senior Living", "Kapson", "Senior Quarters", "ARV", "OLSL", "One
Lantern Senior Living", "Sterling Glen" or "SG" and combinations thereof,
from the name of each Designated Subsidiary. 

   

(vi) _Reorganization Status of Mergers_. Neither Acquiror nor any of the
Merger Subs shall take any action or knowingly fail to take any action, which
action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
any of the Mergers from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368 of the Code. 

   

(vii) _Acquiror Consents_. Immediately following the execution of
this Agreement, Acquiror shall execute and deliver to the Merger Subs duly
executed and valid written consents (the " _Acquiror Consents_ ") adopting
this Agreement and approving the Mergers and the other transactions set forth
herein. 

   

(viii) _Section 16_. Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain approval by its Board of Directors prior to the Closing and all
persons associated with the Stockholders that may become or be deemed a
director of Seller in a manner intended to secure an exemption under Rule
16b-3(d) to the fullest extent permitted thereunder. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(c) _Mutual Covenants_. The Stockholders and Acquiror covenant as follows: 

   

(i) _Third-Party Consents and Operational Governmental Approvals_. 

   

(A) The Parties acknowledge that (i) certain consents of third parties will
be required under instruments, contracts, commitments, agreements or
arrangements with such third parties relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Listed Consents but excluding Operational
Governmental Approvals (the " _Third-Party Consents_ "), and (ii) certain
governmental approvals, permits, licenses (including consents and/or
approvals under relevant state licensing laws), orders, registrations,
certificates, variances or similar requirements or rights, or extensions or
renewals thereof (collectively, " _Operational Governmental Approvals_ ")
will be required in order for Acquiror, the Stockholders, the Companies, the
Company Subsidiaries and/or Management Holdco and its Subsidiaries to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including those contemplated
by the Stockholders Pre-Closing Steps Outline and the Acquiror Pre-Closing
Steps Outline. 

   

(B) The Stockholders and Acquiror agree to use their commercially
reasonable best efforts in good faith to obtain all required Third-Party
Consents prior to Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Stockholders
and Acquiror agree to: (1) cooperate in a commercially reasonable manner in
developing and implementing the strategy and process for seeking the Third-
Party Consents, including, in the case of the Stockholders, considering in
good faith any actions reasonably requested by Acquiror and not detrimental
to the Stockholders or the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries in order
obtain such Third Party Consents (provided that the Stockholders will not be
required to carry out any particular action if the Stockholders have a
commercially reasonable basis for declining the request); (2) consult on a
regular basis and in good faith in carrying out the foregoing strategy and
process for obtaining the Third Party Consents; (3) keep one another
informed, to the extent practical, on a current basis, of any material
developments arising in the process of seeking and obtaining the Third-Party
Consents, including by providing copies of any written correspondence
received by such Party from, or given by such Party to, any counterparty in
connection with the efforts to obtain the Third Party Consents; and (4) if
and to the extent requested, providing the other party with advance notice of
material meetings and/or conference calls with the relevant counterparties
from whom consent is being sought (excluding, for certainty, any such calls
or meetings that arise without advance notice) and, to the extent practical,
with the opportunity to have a representative participate in such meetings
and conference calls. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing,
Acquiror agrees to 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(x) provide information to, and otherwise cooperate with, the Stockholders, as
reasonably requested by the Stockholders, in connection with the
Stockholders efforts to obtain such Third-Party Consents, including by
providing all reasonably requested information about Acquiror and
its Affiliates (which may include non-public or proprietary information about
the affected Facilities and the parties to the applicable agreements,
provided that the information is available or readily producible, is
reasonably related to the consent being sought and the recipient agrees to
reasonable arrangements designed to preserve the confidentiality thereof, but
shall not include "material non public information" regarding the Acquiror
consolidated entity, detailed financial or operating information about any
other tenant or facility of Acquiror or other information determined by
Acquiror in its reasonable discretion to provide a competitive advantage to
the recipient) and about the structure through which Acquiror will hold the
Facilities after Closing, and (y) cooperate with all reasonable requests by
the Stockholders with respect to the structure through which Acquiror will
hold any of the Facilities to which one or more Third Party Consents may
relate (provided that such requests do not conflict with aspects of
the Stockholders Pre-Closing Steps Outline and Acquiror Pre-Closing Steps
Outline in a manner material and adverse to Acquiror or jeopardize Acquirors
ability to maintain its qualification as a REIT within the meaning of Section
856 of the Code or conflict with the requirements of any of Acquirors third-
party financing sources). Without limiting either partys obligations
hereunder, the parties agree that Acquiror will take the lead role in
obtaining all Operational Governmental Approvals. Subject to the foregoing,
Acquiror and the Stockholders agree to cooperate in a commercially reasonable
manner to obtain the Operational Governmental Approvals, including by (i)
cooperating in connection with the submissions that will be required by the
applicable Governmental Authorities in connection with obtaining the
Operational Governmental Approvals, including by forming, as and when
necessary, additional entities to serve as direct and/or indirect
Subsidiaries of any of the Companies or Designated Subsidiaries in connection
with the application for in any Operational Governmental Approval (an "
_Additional Entity Formation_ "), (ii) consulting and cooperating with
each other on a regular basis in the development and implementation of
strategy and process for fulfilling the relevant requirements of all relevant
Governmental Authorities from whom Operational Governmental Approvals are
being sought, (iii) keeping one another informed, to the extent practical, on
a current basis, with respect to any material developments arising in the
process of seeking and obtaining the Operational Governmental Approvals,
including by providing copies of any written correspondence received by such
Party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Authority in
connection with the efforts to obtain the Operational Governmental Approvals,
and (iv) if and to the extent requested, providing the other party with
advance notice of material meetings and/or conference calls with the relevant
Governmental Authorities (excluding, for certainty, any such calls or
meetings that arise without advance notice) and, to the extent practical,
with the opportunity to have a representative participate in such meetings
and conference calls. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that the Stockholders
do not guarantee that the Parties will be able to obtain any of the Third-
Party Consents.  

 

    ##### 

  

   

(C) The Stockholders will not be responsible for seeking or obtaining
Third Party Consents with respect to any of the loans identified as in
_Section 4(a)(vii)(A)(9)_ of the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Listed Loans_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror
agrees that it will use commercially reasonable best efforts to either obtain
all consents and approvals needed in connection with each of the Listed Loans
or repay or defease such Listed Loans, and will bear all costs and expenses
in connection with obtaining all such consents and approvals, including,
without limitation, all costs of (x) any prepayments Acquiror elects to make
of such Listed Loans at or following the Closing and (y) any assumption fees
owing in respect thereof (including any such repayments necessary to obtain
or avoid the need for obtaining any lender consents under the Listed Loans in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The
Stockholders agree to cooperate, as reasonably requested and at Acquirors
sole cost and expense, in connection with Acquirors (or its Subsidiaries)
efforts to assume and/or refinance such indebtedness as more fully described
in  _Section 5(a)(vii)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such cooperation
will not include any requirement by any of the Stockholders or any of their
Affiliates to modify any contract or arrangement with, or offer or grant any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to, any lender or other Person
(other than such modifications and/or accommodations, if any, as may
reasonably be requested by Acquiror and would only be effective from and
after Closing and would not be effective against the Stockholders or any
Company or Company Subsidiary if the Closing does not occur), or to commence
any legal action or otherwise incur any expense or liability. Acquiror hereby
confirms that its obligation to close the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement is not subject to any financing contingency. 

   

(D) Except for expenses incurred in connection with the Listed Loans
and Third-Party Consents relating thereto, which are Acquirors sole expense
as provided in _Section 5(c)(i)(C)_, Acquiror and the Stockholders agree
that they will share equally ( _i_. _e_., 50/50) all out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred by them prior to Closing in connection with obtaining
the Third-Party Consents and the Operational Governmental Approvals,
including (1) the reasonable fees of counsel, accountants, financial advisers
and other professionals incurred in connection therewith, and (2) the costs,
if any, associated with the release of the Retained Guaranty prior to
Closing, including all out-of-pocket costs and expenses of any Retained
Guaranty Sale. This agreement concerning cost sharing shall survive Closing
and any termination of this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

If any of the cash payments required to be made by the Stockholders pursuant
to this _Section 5(c)(i)_ are made by the Companies and the
Designated Subsidiaries prior to Closing, then, for purposes of determining
Net Debt (as provided in _Section 2_ above) at Closing and in the post-
closing adjustment, the Companies shall be deemed to have, at Closing, an
amount of additional cash on hand equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of all
such cash payments made by the Companies and Designated Subsidiaries in
furtherance of obtaining Third Party Consents (so that Acquiror will bear
half of such costs through the closing adjustment calculation). 

   

(ii) _Cooperation; Access_. 

   

(A) Without limiting the provisions of any other Section hereof, after
the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Acquiror and the Stockholders
agree to furnish, or cause to be furnished, to each other and their
respective officers, employees, agents and representatives reasonable access
to, during normal business hours, such information relating to the Companies,
the Surviving Entities and the Designated Subsidiaries, as applicable, and
such other assistance as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting,
required regulatory or other filings, accounting and other reasonably
appropriate purposes; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access or assistance
shall not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Acquiror, the
Stockholders, Management Holdco, the Companies, the Surviving Entities or
their Subsidiaries and such activities shall be conducted at the requesting
partys expense. Acquiror agrees to retain, or cause the Surviving Entities
to retain, such books and records for at least seven (7) years after
the Closing and, if, after seven (7) years but prior to ten (10) years from
the Closing, Acquiror or the applicable Surviving Entity desires to destroy
any such books and records in accordance with its customary document-
retention policies, such entity may destroy them only if before their
destruction Acquiror offers, or causes the applicable Surviving Entity to
offer, in writing, to return such books and records to the Stockholders, and
the Stockholders either reject such written offer or fail to respond to such
written offer within thirty (30) days after receipt thereof. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(B) From time to time after the Closing, as and when requested by any
Party hereto, the Party being requested to act shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and
shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further actions, as are reasonably
necessary or desirable to give full effect to the provisions of this 
_Section 5(c)_, _provided_ that no such document or instrument
shall increase the obligations or liabilities of a Party beyond the
obligations and liabilities set forth in this Agreement. 

   

(C) The provisions of this _Section 5(c)(ii)_ will survive the Closing. 

   

(iii) _Publicity_. The Stockholders and Acquiror shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release to be issued by either of them with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall not
issue any such press release prior to such consultation (and each will act in
good faith to incorporate any reasonable changes requested by the other)
unless the requirements of any Governmental Authority or national stock
exchange make providing such prior consultation and review impracticable.
Further, the Stockholders shall not, and shall cause their representatives
not to, issue any press release or other public statement, or statement to
any securities analyst or investor (other than investors in the funds that
comprise or own the Stockholders to the extent expressly permitted below)
with respect to the financial analysis of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any non-public aspect of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement without the prior written consent of Acquiror (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except that the
Stockholders and their representatives will be entitled to issue or otherwise
make (i) any such press release or statement that the Stockholders in good
faith determine is required by any Governmental Authority or national stock
exchange, in which case the Stockholders shall provide Acquiror with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such press release or
the substance of such statement in advance of such issuance or making to the
extent reasonably practicable (and will act in good faith to incorporate any
reasonable changes requested by Acquiror), (ii) any such statement directed
at a Governmental Authority or at any of the Companies customers, vendors,
landlords, tenants or other business contacts that does not characterize this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in a manner inconsistent
with the press releases issued by, and other public statements made
by, Acquiror from and after the date hereof and (iii) any statements made at
any meeting or presentation with potential investors, financing sources or
rating agencies, or similar meetings or presentations, at which an executive
officer of Acquiror is also present or participating. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Stockholders and their affiliates and representatives will be
entitled to discuss this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein
with the equity investors in the funds that comprise or own the Stockholders,
and the Stockholders and their affiliates and representatives will
be entitled to include non-public information about the transactions
contemplated herein within the scope of such discussions so long as
the equity investors are required to keep any non-public information
contained in such notifications and discussions confidential. The provisions
of this  _Section 5(c)(iii)_ will survive the Closing or a termination of
this Agreement for a period of twelve (12) months. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(iv) _Transfer Taxes_. The Stockholders agree to cooperate with Acquiror
in connection with the preparation and filing of any returns with respect to
the Transfer Taxes (defined below), including promptly supplying any
information in their possession that is reasonably necessary to complete such
returns and, where required by Law, making or joining with Acquiror (or its
applicable Affiliate) in making such filings, it being understood that
Acquiror will take the lead in identifying the Transfer Tax
filing requirements and preparing the relevant materials for submission.
Acquiror and the Stockholders agree to share equally any and all real
property transfer or gains tax, stamp tax, stock transfer tax and other
similar Tax or expense imposed, and all recording fees that may be imposed,
as a result of the transactions contemplated herein or under any
other related agreement, and any fines, penalties, interest or additions with
respect thereto (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), provided that if any
component of Transfer Taxes consists of fines, penalties, interest or
additions resulting from any delay or other inaction or omission by Acquiror
in connection with the preparation or filing thereof, Acquiror alone will
bear all of such fines, penalties, interest or other additions. 

   

(v) _Notice of Certain Matters_. After the date of this Agreement and prior
to the Closing, each Party shall promptly notify the other if it (A) obtains
Knowledge that (I) any of the representations or warranties made herein by
the other Party or deemed to be made by the other Party as of the Closing is
untrue, inaccurate or incorrect in any material respect or (II) the other
Party has breached any of the covenants or agreements made by such Party
herein, in any material respect, or (B) receives any written notice or other
communication from any party to any Material Contract or Acquiror Material
Contract to the effect that such party is terminating or otherwise materially
adversely modifying its relationship with the Companies or the Designated
Subsidiaries or Acquiror or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

(vi) _Termination of Intercompany Arrangements_. Effective at the Closing,
all arrangements, understandings or contracts set forth in _Section
4(a)(xx)_ of the Stockholders Disclosure Schedule shall be terminated
without any party thereto having any continuing obligation to the other,
except for the contracts listed in _Section 5(a)(vi)_ of the Stockholders
Disclosure Schedule; _provided_ , that any agreements, understandings or
contracts entered into by any Stockholder, an Affiliate of Stockholder (other
than a Company and any Designated Subsidiary) or a Company Subsidiary that is
not a Designated Subsidiary with a third party, which third party is not a
Company or Designated Subsidiary, listed in _Section 4(a)(xx)_ of the
Stockholders Disclosure Schedule need not be terminated pursuant to this
Agreement, but rather the Companies and Designated Subsidiaries may instead
agree that it will no longer receive any benefits under such agreements,
understandings or contracts. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(vii) _Term of Confidentiality Agreement_. The Parties agree that
the Confidentiality Agreement shall not expire until the later of (A) the
expiry date set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (B) the earlier
of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7_. 

   

(d) _Tax Matters_. 

   

(i) _Straddle Period_. For purposes of this Agreement, with respect to
any Straddle Period, Taxes shall be allocated between the period ending on
the Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date (i) in the
case of Property Taxes, pro rata on the basis of the number of days in such
period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, on the basis of an interim
closing of the books or accounts as of the close of business on the Closing
Date. 

   

(ii) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. 

   

(A) Acquiror will be responsible for preparing and filing (or causing
the preparation and filing of) all Tax Returns of the Companies and the
Designated Subsidiaries, except to the extent that filing any such Tax
Returns are the responsibility of the Stockholders under _Section
5(d)(ii)(B)_. The Stockholders agree to cooperate with Acquiror, in
accordance with Acquirors reasonable requests, in the preparation and filing
of such Tax Returns. 

   

(B) The Stockholders will be responsible for preparing and filing (or
causing the preparation and filing of) all Tax Returns of the Companies and
the Designated Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods and all Straddle
Periods. Acquiror agrees to cooperate with the Stockholders, in accordance
with the Stockholders reasonable requests, in the preparation and filing of
such Tax Returns. The Stockholders shall (i) prepare the Tax Returns
described in this _Section 5(d)(ii)(B)_ in a manner consistent with the prior
accounting practices, methods, elections and conventions of the relevant
entity, and (ii) provide all Tax Returns described in this _Section
5(d)(ii)(B)_ to Acquiror for review and comments at least 20 days prior to
the due date (including available extensions) for filing such Tax Return, and
shall make good faith efforts to include any comments of Acquiror, and (iii)
not file any Tax Returns for Straddle Periods without the prior written
consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(C) The Tax Returns of the Parties hereto and of the Companies and
the Designated Subsidiaries shall be prepared on the basis that each Merger
qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. 

   

(iii) _Contests_. 

   

(A) If any Governmental Authority asserts a Tax Claim in respect of any of
the Companies or the Designated Subsidiaries, then the party hereto first
receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide written notice
thereof to the other party or parties hereto. 

   

(B) The Stockholders shall, at their own expense, have the right to
control, defend, settle, compromise, or prosecute any audit, examination,
investigation, hearing, or other proceeding (collectively, " _Tax Proceeding_
") with respect to any of the Companies or the Designated Subsidiaries for
any taxable period that ends on or prior to the Closing Date the subject of
which is a claim for Taxes for which the Stockholders are responsible
pursuant to _Section 6_ (a " _Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the Stockholders shall keep Acquiror duly
informed of any such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest, (ii) Acquiror shall be
entitled to receive copies of all correspondence and documents relating to
such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest, (iii) Acquiror shall have the right to
participate in such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest and to employ counsel and
other advisors of Acquirors choice, at Acquirors expense, and (iv) the
Stockholders shall consult with Acquiror in good faith before taking any
significant action in connection with such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest.
If the Stockholders elect not to direct a Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest,
Acquiror or its Affiliates may assume control of such Tax Proceeding. In such
event, Acquiror shall keep the Stockholders informed on a prompt basis
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any Stockholder Pre-Closing
Contest. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in respect of any Stockholder Pre-
Closing Contest, (A) if (i) the Indemnification Basket has not been attained
or exceeded (not taking into account the amount of the claim for Taxes which
is the subject of such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest), or (ii) if (x) the
amount of the claim for Taxes which is the subject of such Stockholder Pre-
Closing Contest exceeds or is expected to exceed (y) the product of the Value
Per Share and the number of the shares of Acquiror Common Stock remaining in
the Escrow Fund at the time of such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest arises,
then (I) such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest shall not be governed by the
foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5(d)(iii)(B)_ and instead Acquiror
and the Stockholders shall jointly have the right to control, defend, settle,
compromise, or prosecute such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest, 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(II) each of Acquiror and the Stockholders shall keep the other Party duly
informed of any development in respect of such Stockholder Pre-Closing
Contest, (III) each of Acquiror and the Stockholders shall be entitled to
receive copies of all correspondence and documents relating to such
Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest, (IV) each of Acquiror and the Stockholders
shall have the right to participate in such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest
and to employ counsel and other advisers of their choice, at each of their
own expense and (V) neither Acquiror nor Stockholders shall
settle, compromise, or abandon any such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest
without the prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld), and (B) if (i) Acquiror has recovered all the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock that Acquiror is to deliver to Escrow Agent
pursuant to _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_ , (ii) the amount of the claim for Taxes
which is the subject of such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest does not exceed,
or is not expected to exceed the Indemnification Threshold, or (iii) such
Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest arises following the Survival End Date, then
such Stockholder Pre-Closing Contest shall be deemed an Acquirors Pre-
Closing Tax Contest and shall be governed by _Section 5(d)(iii)(C)_ (without
giving effect to the proviso contained therein) and not the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 5(d)(iii)(B)_. 

   

(C) Except as expressly provided otherwise in _Section
5(d)(iii)(B)_, Acquiror shall have the right to control, defend, settle,
compromise, or prosecute in any manner a Tax Proceeding with respect to any
of the Companies or the Designated Subsidiaries (a " _Acquiror Pre-Closing
Contest_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquiror, without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders (which consent shall not unreasonably be
withheld), shall not settle, compromise, or abandon any Tax Proceeding
involving a matter for which the Stockholders are reasonably likely to have
indemnification liability under  _Section 6_ (giving effect to the
limitations contained therein). During any period in which the Stockholders
are, or could potentially be, liable to Acquiror for indemnification,
Acquiror agrees to provide the Stockholders with any written correspondence
in connection with any Acquiror Pre-Closing Contest. 

   

 _Cooperation_. The Stockholders and Acquiror shall cooperate with each other
and make available to each other such Tax data and other information as may
be reasonably required in connection with (i) the preparation or filing of
any Tax Return, election, consent or certification, or any claim for refunds,
in each case, of any Company or Designated Subsidiary, (ii) any determination
of liability for Taxes of any Company or Designated Subsidiary, or (iii) any
Tax Proceeding with respect to any Company or any Designated Subsidiary ("
_Tax Data_ "). Such cooperation shall include making their respective
employees and independent auditors reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis for all reasonable purposes, including to sign Tax forms
and consents, to provide explanations and background information and to
permit the copying of books, records, schedules, work papers,
notices, revenue agent reports, settlement or closing agreement and other
documents containing the Tax Data (" _Tax Documentation_ "). The Tax Data and
the Tax Documentation shall be retained until one year after the expiration
of all applicable statutes of limitations (including extensions thereof);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that a Tax Proceeding has been
instituted prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations,
the Tax Data and Tax Documentation relating thereto shall be retained
until there is a final determination thereof (and the time for any appeal has
expired). 

  

    ##### 

  

    

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the procedures with respect to the control, defense, settlement, compromise
or prosecution of Tax Proceedings for any and all Tax matters shall (other
than Transfer Taxes) be governed exclusively by this _Section 5(d)_ and
shall not be governed by _Section 6_. 

   

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 5(d)_,
Transfer Taxes matters shall be governed by _Section 5(c)(iv)_ and not by
this _Section 5(d)_. 

  

6. _Indemnification_. 

  

(a) _Indemnification by the Stockholders_. Following the Closing, the
Stockholders agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify and hold harmless
Acquiror and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns from and against all
costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) (collectively, " _Damages_ ")
actually imposed upon or incurred or suffered by such indemnified party if
and to the extent caused proximately by (i) any breach of any representation
or warranty of the Stockholders in _Section 4(a)_ or in the certificate to
be delivered at Closing pursuant to _Section 3(a)(iii)_ (disregarding
any "material", "materially" or "Material Adverse Effect" qualification
contained in any such representation or warranty, but specifically not
disregarding the term "material" in the definition of "Permitted Lien" and
the term "material" in clause (y) of _Section 4(a)(xviii)(B)_ (regarding
structural defects), when describing an item to be listed on Stockholders
Disclosure Schedule and _Section 4(a)(xviii)(Q)_ (regarding potential
increases in real property taxes or assessments)), (ii) any breach of any
covenant of the Stockholders contained in this Agreement, (iii) Excluded
Taxes or (iv) any claim arising out of the management and operation of
the businesses of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, or the
ownership of the assets of the Company Subsidiaries that are not Designated
Subsidiaries, accruing or otherwise arising before the Closing (including all
Employee Liabilities; all PL/GL Claims and other
professional liability/general liability claims with respect to events prior
to Closing, whether or not such claims are actually covered by the Existing
PL/GL Policies (collectively, the PL/GL Claims and such professional
liability/general liability claims, the " _PL/GL Indemnified Claims_ "); and
the matters set forth in _Section 4(a)(ix)_ of the Stockholders Disclosure
Schedule), (v) the matters set forth in _Section 6(a)(v)_ of the
Stockholders Disclosure Schedule, or (vi) any claim arising out of the
Retained Guaranty, subject, in each case, to the limitations set forth in
paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (h) and (i) of _Section 6_ below and elsewhere in
this Agreement. Acquirors Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns are
intended third-party beneficiaries, but may only seek to enforce the
provisions of this _Section 6_ through Acquiror and not directly. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(b) _Indemnification by Acquiror_. Following the Closing, Acquiror agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted
assigns from and against all Damages actually imposed upon or incurred or
suffered by such indemnified party if and to the extent caused proximately
by (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Acquiror herein or in
the certificate to be delivered at Closing pursuant to _Section 3(b)(iii)_
(disregarding any "material", "materially" or "Material Adverse Effect"
qualification contained in any such representation or warranty), (ii) any
breach of any covenant of Acquiror contained in this Agreement, (iii)
any liability relating to the operation of the businesses of any Company or
Designated Subsidiary or the ownership of their assets, regardless of whether
accruing or otherwise arising before or after the Closing or (iv) the failure
to obtain any consent to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the transactions contemplated in the Pre-Closing Steps Outlines,
from a party to any Listed Agreement or Listed Loan (but specifically
excluding those items, if any, in respect of which Acquiror is entitled to
indemnification from the Stockholders pursuant to  _Section 6(a)_ or any
Facility Management Agreement), subject, in each case, to the limitations in
clauses (c), (d), (e), (h) and (i) of _Section 6_ below and elsewhere in
this Agreement. The Stockholders Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns are intended
third-party beneficiaries but may only seek to enforce the provisions of this
_Section 6_ through one of the Stockholders and not directly. 

   

(c) _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

   

(i) No claim for indemnification may be asserted against either Acquiror, on
the one hand, or any Stockholder, on the other hand, hereunder, unless
written notice of such claim is received by the Party from whom
indemnification is being sought describing, in reasonable detail (to the
extent known at such time), the claim itself and the facts and circumstances
upon which the claim is based on or prior to the date on which the
Partys right to indemnification terminates as set forth in _Section
6(e)_. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein: 

   

(A) except for the representations and warranties regarding authority
and enforceability in the final two sentences of _Section_   _4(a)(i)(A)_ ,
ownership of the shares in the first two sentences of  _Section 4(a)(ii)_,
ownership of the NY License-Holders in the last sentence of _Section
4(a)(ii)_, capitalization in clauses (A)  (D) in _Section 4(a)(iii)_ , and
brokerage fees in _Section 4(a)(xxiii)_, and the covenants and agreements of
Acquiror regarding the post-closing merger consideration adjustment in
_Section 2(e)_, cost of insurance in _Section 5(a)(ii)_, costs relating to
consents and approvals in _Section 5(c)(i)_, Transfer Taxes in _Section
5(c)(iv)_, recovery rights in _Section 6(h)_ and expenses in _Section
8(b)_, (x) the Stockholders shall not be liable to Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and permitted assigns for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to any of clause (i) through (iv) of _Section 6(a)_ other than for
a claim arising out of a PL/GL Indemnified Claim, unless and until the
aggregate amount of Damages that otherwise would be recovered from the
Stockholders hereunder exceeds $20,000,000 (the " _Indemnification Basket_
"), in which case the Stockholders shall be liable only for the amount of
Damages in excess of the Indemnification Basket; (y) no individual claim for
Damages pursuant to any of clause (i) through (v) of _Section 6(a)_ may be
made by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns, or
shall be reimbursable by the Stockholders or shall be included in calculating
the aggregate Damages for purposes of this clause (A) unless the amount of
that particular claim (other than for a claim arising out of a PL/GL
Indemnified Claim), exceeds the _de minimis_ threshold of $50,000 (the "
_Indemnification Threshold_ "); and (z) if the Closing occurs, except
in connection with the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
that are expressly stated in the beginning of this  _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_
as not being subject to the limitations in this _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_, the
sole and exclusive remedy of Acquiror or any other Person has against
Stockholders relating in any manner to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including with respect to PL/GL Indemnified Claims, the
Retained Guaranty and claims pursuant to _Section 6(a)(v)_) shall be
recovery of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that Acquiror is to deliver to
Escrow Agent pursuant to _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_. At the Closing, as collateral
for the Stockholders indemnification obligations under this _Section 6_,
Acquiror will deliver to Escrow Agent a number of shares of Acquiror Common
Stock equal to the quotient of (i) $200,000,000 divided by (ii) the Value Per
Share, rounded to the nearest whole number (the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The
Escrow Agent will release such shares from escrow as provided in the Escrow
Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(B) Except for the representations and warranties regarding authority
and enforceability in the final two sentences of _Section
4(b)(i)(A)_, capitalization in clauses (A)  (C) in _Section 4(b)(ii)_,
authority to issue  shares in _Section 4(b)(iii)_, and brokerage fees in
_Section 4(b)(xiii)_  and the covenants and agreements of Acquiror regarding
the Merger Consideration in _Section 2_, the Additional Payment in _Section
2(g)_, access in _Section 5(a)(iii)_, payment for certain pre-closing
transactions in _Section 5(a)(iv)_, financing cooperation in _Section

approvals set forth in _Section 5(c)(i)_, Transfer Taxes in _Section
5(c)(iv)_, recovery rights in _Section 6(h)_ and expenses in _Section
8(b)_, (x) Acquiror shall not be liable to the Stockholders or any of their
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and permitted assigns for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to any of clause (i) through (iii) of _Section 6(b)_ unless and until the
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages that otherwise would be recovered
from Acquiror equals or exceeds $20,000,000 (the " _Acquiror Indemnification
Basket_ "), in which case Acquiror shall be liable only for the amount of
Damages in excess of the Acquiror Indemnification Basket; (y) no individual
claim for Damages pursuant to clause (i) through (iii) of _Section 6(b)_ may
be made by the Stockholders or any of their Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted
assigns, or shall be reimbursable by Acquiror or shall be included in
calculating the aggregate Damages for purposes of this clause (B) unless the
amount of that particular claim exceeds the _de minimis_ threshold
of $50,000; and (z) in no event shall the aggregate liability of Acquiror
for indemnification pursuant to _Section 6(b)_, except in connection with
the representations, warranties and agreements that are expressly stated in
the beginning of this _Section 6(c)(ii)(B)_ as not being subject to
the limitations in this _Section 6(c)(ii)(B)_, exceed $200,000,000. 

   

(C) Neither Party shall be obligated to indemnify the other or its
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents,
successors and permitted assigns with respect to any Damages if and to the
extent that such other Party received credit or other compensation for such
Damages in the adjustments to the Merger Consideration, if any, to be made
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2(e)_. 

   

(D) Any indemnified party hereunder shall take reasonable action to
mitigate the damages that are the subject of any claim for indemnification
hereunder, including by taking reasonable action to obtain recovery under any
insurance policies or similar arrangements available to such indemnified
party. 

   

(E) No party hereto shall have any liability under this Agreement for
any punitive, consequential, special or indirect Damages, including
business interruption, loss of future revenue, profits or income or loss of
business reputation or opportunity relating to the breach or alleged breach
of this Agreement. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Adjustments_. The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is
provided under this _Section 6_ shall be net of any amounts actually
recovered (regardless of time) by the Indemnified Party from any third party
pursuant to any indemnification or other contractual arrangements in place as
of Closing or covered by any insurance policies available to such indemnified
party (or, in the case of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, available to
Acquiror or the Companies or Surviving Entities or any of the Subsidiaries of
the Companies or Surviving Entities), and to the extent of the amount of any
such proceeds that is received by the Indemnified Party after payment has
been made by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Section 6_ and has not been deducted from the calculation of the Damages,
such amount shall be paid by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party
as promptly as practicable. Further, the amount of any Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this  _Section 6_ shall be (A) increased
to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the Indemnified Party arising
from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder ( _i_. _e_., paid on a
grossed-up basis) and (B) reduced to take account of any net Tax benefit
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Damages. Any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Section 6_
will be treated as an adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration for Tax
purposes, unless a final determination by an appropriate
Governmental Authority with respect to the indemnified party causes any such
payment not to constitute an adjustment to the Final Merger Consideration for
federal Income Tax purposes. 

  

(e) _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless a Party hereto pursuant to this _Section 6_ shall terminate at
midnight on the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the "
_Survival End Date_ "); _provided_ , that Acquirors or the Stockholders, as
applicable, obligations pursuant to _Section 2(g)_,  _Section 5(b)(ii)_,
_Section 5(b)(v)_, _Section 5(c)(ii)_ and _Section 8(f)_ shall survive
beyond that date, subject to the limitations, if any, provided therein; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless
shall continue with respect to any specific claim for indemnification as to
which the Party entitled to indemnification shall have delivered written
notice of claim to the indemnifying party setting forth the nature of the
claim, in reasonable detail (to the extent known at such time),
before midnight on the Survival End Date (or such later date as is provided
for survival above in this  _Section 6(e)_, if applicable) and any such
claim so made shall expire on the earlier of (i) the date on which the
parties resolve the dispute between them and (ii) the ninetieth (90th) day
following the receipt by the party against whom indemnity is being claimed
of a written notice unless the claiming party shall have filed a legal action
in a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of that claim on or prior to
the expiry of such ninetieth (90th) day (in which case the claim for
indemnification shall expire upon final non-appealable resolution of that
legal action). 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(f) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. 

   

(i) In order for a Party or its Affiliate or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and permitted assigns (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to indemnification provided for
hereunder in respect of a claim or demand made by any third party against it
(a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall notify the other
Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of the Third-Party Claim
within the required time period specified above in  _Section 6(e)_ and shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents
accompanying or constituting the Third-Party Claim as soon as reasonably
possible and in any event within ten (10) Business Days after obtaining
notice thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder (so long
as notice is provided within the required time period set forth in _Section
6(e)_), except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, as soon as reasonably possible and
in any event within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to deliver such copies shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure. 

   

(ii) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses and promptly (and in any event, at least ten (10) days
before a response to such Third-Party Claim is due) gives notice of its
intention to do so to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense thereof
with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to
assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be
liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall
control such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the actual or
potential defendants in, or targets of, such Third-Party Claim include both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
shall have reasonably concluded that there are or are reasonably likely to be
legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional to
those available to the Indemnifying Party or that there exists or is
reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest, in either case that would
make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for
the same counsel to represent both the 

 

    ##### 

  

   

Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party in the defense thereof if the
claim ultimately is determined to have been covered by the indemnification
provisions of this  _Section 6_. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend
or otherwise prosecute a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in the defense or other prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the
provision to the Indemnifying Party of any records and other information
relevant to such Third-Party Claim and making any relevant
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to,
or settle, compromise or discharge, or otherwise take any action that
reasonably could be expected to compromise or interfere with the defense of,
such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

   

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude
the Indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, from settling, compromising
or otherwise discharging any Third-Party Claim in such manner as the
Indemnifying Party deems appropriate without the consent of the Indemnified
Party so long as, in connection therewith, (A) such settlement or judgment
does not include any admission of liability, wrongdoing or misconduct on
behalf of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (B) the
Indemnifying Party does not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified
Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or
materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any
Indemnified Partys businesses and (C) the Indemnifying Party obtains a full
and complete release by the third-party claimant of the Indemnified Party and
any of its Affiliates that are named as potentially liable in the underlying
claim from any liability in respect of the Third-Party Claim. 

   

(iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the procedures with respect to the
control, defense, settlement, compromise or prosecution of Tax Proceedings
for any and all Tax Matters (other than Transfer Taxes) shall be governed
exclusively by _Section 5(d)_ and shall not be governed by the above
provisions of this _Section 6(f)_. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(g) _Exclusivity_. Subject to the Parties rights to seek specific performance
under  _Section 7(c)_, the Parties confirm and agree that, if the Closing
occurs, (i) the indemnification provisions (including the limitations
thereto) set forth in this _Section 6_ (and  _Section 5(a)(iii)_ (access),
_Section 5(a)(vii)_ (financing cooperation) and  _Section 5(b)(ii)_ (DandO
indemnification)) are the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Parties
for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other claim
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and/or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) except in connection with the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements that are expressly stated in the
beginning of _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_ as not being subject to the limitations
in  _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_, the sole and exclusive remedy Acquiror or any
other Person has against the Stockholders relating in any manner to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be recovery of shares
of Acquiror Common Stock that Acquiror is to deliver to Escrow Agent pursuant
to _Section 6(c)(ii)(A)_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than with respect to fraud) that such Party may have against
the other Party arising under this Agreement or otherwise relating to any
Company or Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated herein, whether at law, in equity or otherwise,
except to the extent of claims specifically provided for in this _Section
6_. 

  

(h) _No Subrogation Rights_. No Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to seek
recovery against a debtor to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any theory of
subrogation, contribution or otherwise of any Damages payable to such an
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to seek recovery against an Indemnified Party in the event that
the Indemnified Party, its Affiliates or its Representatives fail to take
reasonable action to obtain recovery under any insurance policies or similar
arrangements pursuant to  _Section 6(c)(ii)(D)_ or fail to pay to the
Indemnifying Party the amount of such proceeds after payment has been made by
the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 6_. 

  

(i) _No Duplication_. Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement
shall be determined without duplication of recovery due to the facts (i)
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement or (ii) taken into account in
determining any adjustment to the Merger Consideration. 

  

7. _Termination_. 

   

(a) _Termination Rights_. This Agreement may be terminated as follows: 

   

(i) by mutual written consent of the Stockholders and Acquiror; 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(ii) by either Acquiror or the Stockholders if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or prior to the " _Outside Date_ ", which shall mean April 1,
2011 or such other date to which it is extended pursuant to this _Section
7_; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if all of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in _Section 3_ (disregarding for this purpose the condition set
forth in _Section 3(a)(iv)_) are capable of being satisfied on April 1,
2011, or have been waived other than the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Section 3(a)(v)_ and/or _Section 3(b)(v)_, then the Outside Date shall
automatically be extended to May 31, 2011; and  _provided_ ,  _further_ ,
that if all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 3_ are
capable of being satisfied on April 1, 2011 or May 31, 2011, as applicable
(as applicable, the " _Prior Outside Date_ "), or have been waived, other
than those set forth in _Section 3(a)(iv)_, then, upon written notice
provided by either Acquiror, on the one hand, or the Stockholders, on the
other hand, to the other prior to the Prior Outside Date, the Outside Date
shall be extended to July 1, 2011; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in the
event that Acquiror has delayed the Closing pursuant to  _Section 1(b)(ii)_
and, as a result, the Delayed Closing would occur after the then-effective
Outside Date, then (without limitation to the other extensions set forth
in this _Section 7(a)(ii)_) the Outside Date shall be extended to the day
after the date of the Delayed Closing; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7(a)(ii)_ shall
not be available to a Party if the occurrence of any such failure of the
Closing to occur was primarily due to the failure of such Party to perform in
any material respect its obligations under this Agreement; 

   

(iii) by either Acquiror or the Stockholders if any injunction, judgment,
order, decree or Law permanently preventing, restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Mergers pursuant to this Agreement
shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7(a)(iii)_ shall
not be available to a Party if the occurrence of any such injunction,
judgment, order, decree or Law was primarily due to the failure of such Party
to perform in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement; 

   

(iv) by the Stockholders if Acquiror has breached in any material respect
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by Acquiror in
this Agreement or any such representation or warranty shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the condition set forth in
either _Section 3(b)(i)_ or  _Section 3(b)(ii)_ would not be satisfied and
such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, within thirty (30)
days of receipt of written notice to Acquiror by the Stockholders of such
breach or failure of condition (or, if earlier, the then-applicable Outside
Date), Acquiror has not either (A) cured the breach or (B) provided
the Stockholders with reasonable assurance that such breach or condition will
be cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholders
are not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause either of
the conditions set forth in  _Section 3(a)(i)_ or _Section 3(a)(ii)_ not to
be satisfied; and  _provided_ , _further_ that such termination right shall
only be available if the effect of Acquirors breach is to cause the failure
of consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; 

 

    ##### 

  

   

(v) by Acquiror if the Stockholders have breached in any material respect
any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made by the
Stockholders in this Agreement or any such representation or warranty shall
have become untrue after the date of this Agreement, such that the condition
set forth in either _Section 3(a)(i)_ or  _Section 3(a)(ii)_ would not be
satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, within
thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice to the Stockholders by Acquiror
of such breach or failure of condition (or, if earlier, the then-applicable
Outside Date), the Stockholders have not either (A) cured the breach or (B)
provided Acquiror with reasonable assurance that such breach or
condition will be cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Acquiror is not then in material breach of this Agreement so as to cause
either of the conditions set forth in _Section 3(b)(i)_ or _Section
3(b)(ii)_ not to be satisfied; and  _provided_ , _further_ that such
termination right shall only be available if the effect of the Stockholders
breach is to cause the failure of consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; or 

   

(vi) by the Stockholders if the conditions set forth in _Section 3_ (other
than any condition that, by its nature, can only be satisfied at Closing)
have been satisfied or waived but Acquiror fails to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

(b) _Liquidated Damages_. If the Stockholders terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section 7(a)(iv)_ or _Section 7(a)(vi)_, Acquiror covenants
and agrees that it will promptly, and in any event within three (3) Business
Days of such termination, pay $150,000,000 by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated by the Stockholders in
writing as (except in each case for Acquirors obligations in connection with
the provisions hereof that survive a termination of this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 7(d)_) the sole and exclusive remedy of the Stockholders for,
and full and complete liquidated damages for, the failure giving rise to the
right of termination, it being agreed between the Parties that the actual
damages to the Stockholders in the event of such failure to consummate the
transactions contemplated herein are impracticable if not impossible to
determine and that such amount is a reasonable estimate thereof. In the event
of any delay in the payment by Acquiror of the amount required by this
_Section 7(b)_ beyond three (3) Business Days after a termination
pursuant to _Section 7(a)(iv)_ or _Section 7(a)(vi)_, the Stockholders will
be entitled to receive interest on the unpaid amount from such third Business
Day at 10% per annum, compounding monthly, until all amounts owing hereunder
have been paid in full. For purposes of clarity, Acquirors obligation to pay
to the Stockholders $150,000,000 in cash, plus interest thereon
if applicable, as set forth in the preceding sentence will survive a
termination of this Agreement. 

  

(c) _Specific Performance_. The Parties recognize and agree that if for any
reason any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, immediate and
irreparable harm or damage may be caused for which money damages would not be
an adequate remedy. Accordingly, each Party hereto agrees that, in
addition to any other available remedies, each other Party shall be entitled
to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement or
an injunction restraining any breach or violation or threatened breach or
violation of the provisions of this Agreement without the necessity of
posting a bond or other form of security. In the event that any Action should
be brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party
shall allege, and each Party hereto hereby waives the defense, that there is
an adequate remedy at law. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

(d) _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided herein, this Agreement will become void and there will be no
liability or obligation on the part of any party except in connection with
the provisions of _Section 4(a)(xxiii)_ and _Section 4(b)(xviii)_ relating
to broker fees, _Section 5(a)(iii)_ relating to access, _Section 5(a)(iv)_
relating to reimbursement of certain expenses for pre-closing transactions, 
_Section 5(a)(vii)_ relating to financing cooperation, _Section 5(b)(i)_
relating to confidentiality, _Section 5(c)(i)_ relating to consents and
approvals expenses,  _Section 5(c)(iii)_ relating to public announcements,
_Section 5(c)(vii)_ relating to confidentiality, this _Section 7_, _Section
8(a)_ relating to certain acknowledgements,  _Section 8(b)_ relating to
expenses, _Section 8(d)_ relating to third-party beneficiaries, _Section
8(f)_ relating to notices, _Section 8(l)_ relating to governing law,
_Section 8(n)_ relating to jurisdiction and, in each case, the definitions of
the terms used therein.

Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required to be reflected
therein by the terms of this Agreement and may contain additional disclosures

    ##### 

  

  

(k) _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement. 

  

(l) _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York.

not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this

(o) _No Recordation_. Each of the Parties agrees that neither this Agreement
nor any memorandum or notice hereof shall be recorded.

If either Party gives notice to the other that it wishes to submit to
arbitration a dispute arising between the Parties with respect to the
calculation of the Additional Payment pursuant to  _Section 2(g)_ above or
the valuation of an in-kind dividend pursuant to _Section 2(c)_ above, the
dispute will be submitted to a panel of three arbitrators for resolution in
accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " _Rules_ ") of the
American Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") as modified by the provisions of
this _Section 8(p)_. Each Party agrees that the award of the arbitrators
will be final and non-appealable and will be the sole and exclusive remedy
between them regarding any and all claims or other issues arising out of such
dispute. The Parties agree that one arbitrator will be appointed by Acquiror
and one by the Stockholders and the third will be selected by the two party-
appointed arbitrators or, failing agreement between them within fifteen (15)
days after both Party-appointed arbitrators have been appointed, by the AAA
in accordance with the Rules. If either Party fails to appoint an arbitrator
within ten (10) days of receipt of notice from the other requesting
arbitration, then the matter will be resolved by arbitration before the
single arbitrator selected by the Party delivering such notice. Each
Party will select an arbitrator that is not affiliated with such party and
that is reasonably experienced in financial matters to consider the matter to
be submitted for resolution. 

 

    ##### 

  

  

Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted pursuant to the Rules in the
English language in New York, New York. Each party agrees to facilitate the
arbitration by: (i) making available to each other and to the arbitrators for
inspection and extraction all documents, books, records and personnel under
