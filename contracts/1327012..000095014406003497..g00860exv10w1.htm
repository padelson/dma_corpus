_Sycamore Preferred Stock Consideration_ ") and (Y) Univision Communications,
Inc.s (" _Univision_ ") portion of the Accrued Amount shall be paid by the
issuance of one (1) share of Series A Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock
of Coconut Palm (which shall have the terms set forth in the Certificate of
Designation for Series A Convertible Non-Voting Preferred Stock in the form
of _Exhibit B_) per $5.13 of Accrued Amount owed to Univision, as adjusted
appropriately for stock splits and similar transactions through the Effective
Time (" _Univision Preferred Stock Consideration_ "). The Preferred Stock
Cash Consideration, the Sycamore Preferred Stock Consideration, and

the " _Preferred Stock Consideration_." The Common Stock Consideration and
the Preferred Stock Consideration is referred to as the " _Merger
Consideration_ " and shall be payable upon surrender, in the manner provided
in _Section 2.02_, of the certificates that formerly evidenced the shares of
the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and
Class A Preferred Stock (collectively 
the " _Share(s)_ "). 

  

 (b) _Payment of the Preferred Stock Cash Consideration_. The Preferred Stock Cash Consideration shall be allocated among the holders of the Class A Preferred Stock based on each such holders prorata ownership of the Class A Preferred Stock. Such consideration shall become payable at Closing and be paid promptly following the Effective Time in exchange for: (i) the delivery by each holder of Class A Preferred Stock of share certificates evidencing the Class A Preferred Stock owned of record by such Person to Coconut Palm at Closing, and (ii) solely with respect to Univision, the execution by Univision of the Univision Affiliation Agreement (described in _Section 6.10_) at and effective as of the Closing. The payment of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) of the Preferred Stock Cash Consideration due to Univision (or its assigns) shall be deemed satisfied upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated under the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement in the form of _Exhibit L_ executed immediately following the date hereof. In the event the transactions contemplated by the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement are not consummated prior to or concurrently with the Closing of this Agreement (other than for a material breach of the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement by Univision thereunder), then EBC shall (i) issue to Univision a promissory note (" _Note_ ") in the amount of Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000) secured, with a first priority lien in favor of Univision, by all of the assets sought to be transferred pursuant to the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement, (ii) execute a security agreement ("Security Agreement") with respect to such security on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Univision, and (iii) so long as the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement has not terminated, execute a Local Marketing Agreement ("LMA") with respect to the Stations (as defined in the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement) on customary terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the parties. The term of the Note and the Security Agreement shall be for one (1) year unless the transactions contemplated by the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement are consummated prior to the expiration of the one (1) year term in such event the Note shall be cancelled and Security Agreement shall be terminated, as consideration for the assets acquired by Univision pursuant to the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement. The LMA shall terminate when the Univision Asset Purchase Agreement 

   ##### 

  

 

terminates, or when the transactions contemplated thereunder close. Interest
on the principal amount outstanding under the Note shall be at a rate of
seven percent (7%) per annum payable monthly. During the term of the Note,
Univision shall pay EBC a monthly operating fee in an amount equal to the
seven percent (7%) interest paid under the Note in connection with a LMA. 

   

 (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Coconut Palm-Owned Stock_. Each Share held in the treasury of EBC and each Share owned by Coconut Palm or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Coconut Palm or of EBC immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

  

 (d) _Percentage Ownership of Coconut Palm Common Stock_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the Common Stock Consideration, the Sycamore Preferred Stock Consideration and the Univision Preferred Stock Consideration (on an as-converted basis) shall account for and represent approximately 67.52% (following payment of the Preferred Stock Consideration) of the issued and outstanding Coconut Palm Common Stock as of the Effective Time. 

  

 SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates for Coconut Palm Common Stock_. 

  

 (a) _Share Exchange Agent_. At the Effective Time Coconut Palm shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company or such other bank, trust company or fiduciary as may be designed by Coconut Palm which shall be reasonably acceptable to EBC (the " _Share Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of holders of the Shares, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Share Exchange Agent (i) certificates evidencing the shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ in exchange for the Shares and (ii) upon the request of the Exchange Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to make any cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.02(e)_ (such certificates for shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock being hereafter collectively referred to as the " _Share Exchange Fund_ "). The Share Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Coconut Palm Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ out of the Share Exchange Fund to holders of the Shares. Except as contemplated by _Section 2.02(f)_ hereof, the Share Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any interest, dividends or other income earned on the investment of any cash or other property held in the Share Exchange Fund shall be for the account of Coconut Palm. 

  

 (b) _Escrow Agent; Escrow of Coconut Palm Common Stock_. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, at the Effective Time Coconut Palm shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Wachovia or such other bank, trust company or fiduciary as may be designated by Coconut Palm, which shall be reasonably acceptable to EBC (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), an aggregate of 2,100,000 shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock (the " _Escrow_ ") in amounts from each shareholder of EBC equal to each shareholders pro rata percentage based on the number of shares of Common Stock (without giving effect to the conversion of any Series A Preferred Stock) held by such shareholder relative to the other shareholders (the " _Escrowed Coconut Palm Common Stock_ "). The Escrow shall be established for the benefit of Coconut Palm solely to 

   ##### 

  

 

satisfy any indemnification obligation of EBC arising pursuant to _Section
6.12_ of this Agreement, subject to the provisions and limitations contained
in such _Section 6.12_. The term of the Escrow shall be for twelve (12)
months from the Effective Date (the " _Escrow Period_ "), and within five (5)
business days following the termination of the Escrow Period, the Escrow
Agent shall distribute any remaining Escrowed Coconut Palm Common Stock in
accordance with the procedures of this _Article II_ and in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement to be executed by Coconut Palm and EBC
prior to Closing which agreement shall be without recourse to any shareholder
of EBC (including, without limitation, the Major EBC
Shareholders). Alternatively, the Major EBC Shareholders may, at their own
expense, obtain insurance, in the amount of the valuation of Escrowed Coconut
Palm Common Stock, the proceeds of which will be paid directly and only to
Coconut Palm to remedy any such indemnification obligation of EBC
arising pursuant to _Section 6.12_. A binder for such insurance, if obtained
in lieu of the escrow, shall be delivered to Coconut Palm ten (10) days prior
to Closing and shall be obtained from a nationally recognized insurance
company or an insurance company reasonably acceptable to Coconut Palm. The
Escrow Agent and the Share Exchange Agent may be the same Person. 

   

 (c) _Exchange Procedures_. The Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Share Exchange Agent to mail, within Ten (10) business days after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced the outstanding Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Share Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) subject to the reasonable approval of EBC, and (ii) instructions to effect the surrender of the Certificates (or Affidavit of lost shares " _Lost Share Affidavit_ ") in exchange for the certificates evidencing shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate, or Lost Share Affidavit, along with an accompanying indemnity bond, if requested, for cancellation to the Share Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) certificates evidencing that number of whole shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ in respect of the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate, (B) any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_, and (C) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares of EBC Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock or Class A Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of EBC, the Merger Consideration may be issued and paid in accordance with this _Article II_ to a transferee if the Certificate evidencing such Shares is presented to the Share Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer (including proper endorsements) and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or by the transferee requesting such payment paying to the Share Exchange Agent any such transfer tax; any such evidence of transfer and payment of transfer taxes shall be reasonably acceptable to Coconut Palm. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.02_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Coconut Palm Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.02(d)_, until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate or provide a Lost Share Affidavit along with an accompanying indemnity bond, if requested. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the Person in whose name the certificates representing the shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock into which such Certificates were converted and registered, all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such Coconut Palm Common Stock on a date after, and in respect of a record date after, the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Coconut Palm Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and any such fractional share interest shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Coconut Palm. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each holder of the Shares upon surrender of a Certificate for exchange pursuant to this  _Article II_ shall be paid an amount in cash (without interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the per share closing price on the OTC Bulletin Board of Coconut Palm Common Stock on the date of the Effective Time (or, if shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board on such date, the first date of trading of such Coconut Palm Common Stock on the OTC Bulletin Board after the Effective Time) by (ii) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking into account all Shares then held of record by such holder). 

  

 (f) _Termination of Share Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Share Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class A Preferred Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Coconut Palm, upon demand, and any holders of EBC capital stock who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Coconut Palm for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. Neither Coconut Palm nor EBC shall be liable to any holder of shares of EBC capital stock for any such shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) from the Share Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (h) _Withholding Rights_. Coconut Palm or the Share Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares of EBC such amounts as Coconut Palm or the Share Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Coconut Palm or the Share Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares of EBC in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Coconut Palm or the Share Exchange Agent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Coconut Palm Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Share Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of EBC shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of EBC. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to Coconut Palm for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.01(a)_. 

  

 SECTION 2.04 _EBC Stock Options and Warrants_. 

  

 (a) Stock options to purchase 2,240,000 shares of EBCs Class A Common Stock outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time pursuant to EBCs stock option plans listed in _Section 3.03_ of the EBC Disclosure Schedule that have an exercise price per Share of $7.50 (the " _EBC Stock Options_ " in aggregate, and the " _EBC Stock Option_ " individually), shall (subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.04_) be converted into options to purchase an aggregate of 3,274,853.12 shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock at fair market value as of the date of the Effective Time (" _FMV of Coconut Palm Stock_ "). Vesting schedules for such EBC Stock Options will be in accordance with current expiration dates. Options to purchase shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock granted pursuant to this _Section 2.04_ shall be granted in accordance with the same terms, restrictions and conditions as EBC Stock Options with respect to which such options are being granted. All outstanding warrants to purchase capital stock of EBC shall be cancelled as of the Effective Date. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this _Section 2.04_, in the event that at the Effective Time the fair market value of EBCs Class A Common Stock (the " _FMV of EBC Stock_ ") exceeds $7.50 per Share, EBC Stock Options shall be converted into options to purchase an aggregate of 3,274,853.12 shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock. Specifically, each EBC Stock Option shall be converted into an option to purchase 1.461988 shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock at the exercise price of $Y per share, where Y is such that 2,240,000 times (FMV of EBC Stock minus $7.50) equals 3,274,853.12 times (FMV of Coconut Palm Stock-$Y), provided that Y is such that the conversion of EBC Stock Options contemplated by this _Section 2.04_ will not be treated as the grant of a new stock right or a change in the form of payment for purposes of section 409A, pursuant to Prop. Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D) and provided that Y is such that the conversion of EBC Stock Options contemplated by this _Section 2.04_ shall not be considered a modification of EBC Stock Options pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.424-1(a). For purposes of this _Section 2.04_, the FMV of EBC Class A Common Stock 

   ##### 

  

 

shall be determined by multiplying the FMV of Coconut Palm Common Stock as of
the Effective Time by 1.461988. The following Example 1 will illustrate this
_Section 2.04(b)_: 

   

 (c) _Example 1_ : Assume the FMV of Coconut Palm Common Stock as of the Effective Time is $6.00 per share. The FMV of EBC Class A Common Stock will equal $8.7719 ($6.00 x 1.461988) per share. Assuming an EBC Class A Common Stock Option holder owns the option to buy 1,000 shares of EBC Stock and decides to exercise all 1,000 options immediately prior to the Effective time, he will receive stock worth $8,772 ($8.7719 x 1,000) for a cost of $7,500 ($7.50 x 1,000). However, if the same option holder waited until immediately after the Effective Time to exercise the options that were converted to Coconut Palm Common Stock, his option to buy 1,000 shares of EBC Class A Common Stock will be converted to the option to buy 1,462 (1,000 x 1.461988) shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock at the exercise price of $5.13012. The cost of exercising all 1,462 options is $7,500 ($5.13 x 1,462) and the fair market value of the stock purchased equals $8,772 ($6.00 x 1,462). 

  

 SECTION 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the ABCA, Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any shareholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for such Shares (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 4-27-1301 et seq. of the ABCA shall not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration. Any such shareholder shall instead be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shareholders Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of the ABCA; provided, however, that all Dissenting Shares held by any shareholder who shall have failed to perfect or who otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such shareholders rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 4-27-1301 et seq. shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender in the manner provided in _Section 2.02_ of the Certificate or Certificates that formerly evidenced such Shares. 

  

 (b) EBC shall give Coconut Palm (i) prompt notice of any demands received by EBC for appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the ABCA and received by EBC and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and, following the Effective Time, direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the ABCA. EBC shall not, except with the prior written consent of Coconut Palm which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 SECTION 2.06 _EBC Shareholder Representative_. 

  

 (a) In order to administer efficiently (i) the implementation of the Escrow Agreement on behalf of the shareholders of EBC and (ii) the settlement of any dispute with respect to the 

   

 



 

       |   |   
---|---|--- 
    2  |   | The exercise price of Coconut Palm Stock option is
calculated by solving the following equation for Y: 2,240,000 (8.7719  7.50)
= 3,274,853.12 (6.00  Y)  
      ##### 

  

      

Agreement, EBC and Univision shall, prior to the Effective Time, designate one
to two Persons to act as a representative on behalf of the shareholders of
EBC (collectively, the " _EBC Shareholder Representative_ "). By approving
this Agreement, the shareholders of EBC authorize and empower the EBC
Shareholder Representative to make such designation, approve and ratify all
of the rights, powers and authorities provided to the EBC Shareholder
Representative under the terms of this Agreement, and agree to be bound by
all decisions and other actions taken by the EBC Shareholder
Representative. 

   

 (b) The EBC Shareholder Representative shall be reimbursed for its reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred in the performance of its duties herein. The Major EBC Shareholders shall share such expenses pro rata based upon pro rata Common Stock ownership (on a non-converted basis) of the Surviving Corporation, immediately following the Effective Time. Said reimbursement shall not be required in the event the EBC Shareholder Representative recovers such expenses as a result of indemnification of the EBC Shareholder Representative by the Surviving Corporation as provided in Section 6.12(h). 

  

 (c) By their execution and/or approval of this Agreement, EBC, the Major EBC Shareholders and the other shareholders of EBC who are not the Major EBC Shareholders agree that from and after the Effective Time: 

   

 (i) The EBC Shareholder Representative is authorized (a) to take all action necessary on behalf of the shareholders of EBC in connection with the settlement of any dispute with regard to matters pertaining to the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and (b) to give and receive all notices required to be given under the Escrow Agreement; 

   

 (ii) Coconut Palm shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the EBC Shareholder Representative as to any actions required or permitted to be taken by the EBC Shareholder Representative hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, and no party hereunder shall have any cause of action against Coconut Palm for any action taken by Coconut Palm in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the EBC Shareholder Representative; 

   

 (iii) All actions, decisions and instructions of the EBC Shareholder Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the shareholders of EBC and no shareholder of EBC shall have any cause of action against the EBC Shareholder Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the EBC Shareholder Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, except for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the EBC Shareholder Representative; 

   

 (iv) In taking any action hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement, the EBC Shareholder Representative shall be protected in relying upon any notice, paper or other document reasonably believed by it to be genuine, or upon any evidence reasonably deemed by it, in its good faith judgment, to be sufficient; provided, however, that the EBC Shareholder Representative shall not waive any rights with respect to any interest of an individual shareholder of EBC if such waiver would have the effect of disproportionately and adversely affecting such individual shareholder of EBC as 

   ##### 

  

   

compared to the interests of the other shareholders of EBC, without the prior
consent of such adversely effected shareholder(s) of EBC; and 

   

 (v) The EBC Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to Coconut Palm, the Major EBC Shareholders or other shareholders of EBC (who are not the Major EBC Shareholders) for any act performed or omitted to be performed by it in the good faith exercise of its duties and shall be liable only in the case of fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the EBC Shareholder Representative. The EBC Shareholder Representative shall not be responsible for determining or verifying the authority of any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the EBC Shareholder Representative shall be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation as provided in _Section 6.12_ _(h)_. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree and acknowledge that the foregoing appointment of the EBC Shareholder Representative by and on behalf of Univision shall apply only with respect to Univisions Escrowed Shares and Univisions rights as a holder of Common Shares of EBC and not in any other respect or capacity.

Each of EBC and each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be expected to have a EBC Material Adverse Effect. The term " _EBC Material Adverse Effect_ " means any event, circumstance, development, change or effect that, individually or in the aggregate with all other events, circumstances, developments, changes and effects, is materially adverse to the business, operations, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of EBC and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole or would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") or prevent or materially impair or delay the ability of EBC or the Major EBC Shareholders to perform their respective obligations hereunder; provided, however, that none of the following shall be deemed to constitute, and none of the following shall be taken into account in determining whether there has been, an EBC Material Adverse Effect: any adverse change, event, condition, development, or effect arising from or relating to (i) general business or economic conditions, (ii) national or international

   ##### 

  

   

Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
such Third Party Claim at its expense. 

   

 (ii) _Defense_. The EBC Shareholder Representative shall have the additional right, at its option (subject to the limitations set forth below) at its own expense, by written notice to Coconut Palm, to assume the entire control of, subject to the right of Coconut Palm to participate (at its expense and with counsel of its choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint a recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to Coconut Palm to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense. If EBC Shareholder Representative elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim: 

   

 1\. the EBC Shareholder Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third party Claim and shall keep Coconut Palm reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided, however, that in the case of any settlement providing for remedies other than monetary damages for which indemnification is provided, Coconut Palm shall have the right to approve the settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and 

   

 2\. Coconut Palm shall fully cooperate in all respects with the EBC Shareholder Representative in any such defense, compromise or settlement thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel, and Coconut Palm shall make available to the EBC Shareholder Representative all pertinent information and documents under his control.

 (d) _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.12_ are covered by insurance, Coconut Palm shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such insurance; provided that Coconut Palm shall nevertheless be entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under this  _Section 6.12_ in respect of such Losses and the time limitations set forth in _Section 6.12(e_ ) hereof for bringing a claim of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled during the pendency of such insurance claim.

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) _Limitations on Indemnification_. 

   

 (i) _Survival_. The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the " _Survival Period_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, any claim made by a party hereunder by filing a suit or action in a court of competent jurisdiction for breach of a representation or warranty prior to the termination of the Survival Period provided hereunder for such claim shall be preserved despite the subsequent termination of such Survival Period. 

   

 (ii) _Amount and Source Limitation_. Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein (except for _Section 6.12(f)_), the aggregate maximum liability of EBC for Losses pursuant to _Section 6.12_ shall not in any event exceed the Escrow, and neither Coconut Palm nor any Coconut Palm Indemnitee shall have any claim hereunder against EBC, any Subsidiary or the Major EBC Shareholders other than for the shares (and any proceeds of the shares or distributions with respect to the shares) held as part of the Escrow which shall constitute the sole source of payment of any indemnification claim hereunder. 

   

 (iii) _Amount Less Than EBC Maximum Indebtedness_. In the event the total Indebtedness of EBC as reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet (the " _EBC Closing Date Indebtedness_ ") shall be less than the EBC Maximum Indebtedness, then any Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section 6.12_ shall be paid solely by the Surviving Corporation up to the amount by which the EBC Maximum Indebtedness, subject to adjustment in  _Section 7.02(s)_, exceeds the EBC Closing Date Indebtedness. For example, by way of illustration and not limitation, if the EBC Closing Indebtedness equals $58,000,000, and the EBC Maximum Indebtedness equals $62,000,000 (as determined in accordance with _Section 3.03(d)_ ), then any Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section 6.12_ shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation (and not paid from the Escrow) up to $4,000,000, with any Losses subject to indemnification under this _Section 6.12_ which are over $4,000,000 paid from the Escrow. 

  

 (f) _Exclusive Remedy_. Coconut Palm hereby acknowledge and agree that, from and after the Closing, its sole remedy with respect to any and all claims for damages arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to the requirements and limitations of the indemnification provisions set forth in this _Section 6.12_. The parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the Closing: EBCs indemnification of Coconut Palm pursuant to _Section 6.12(a_ ) shall not be subject to the limitations of _Section 6.12(e)(ii_) above and that any claims for indemnification under _Section 6.12(a_) or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement may only be brought against EBC directly and not any EBC shareholders, officers, directors, agents, or representatives. 

  

 (g) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for indemnification under  _Section 6.12_ shall reduce the total Merger Consideration and thus the shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock issued by Coconut Palm as a result of the Merger, except as otherwise required by Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) _EBC Shareholder Representative_. John Whitmore shall be the EBC Shareholder Representative. The EBC Shareholder Representative shall have all rights and obligations to represent EBC shareholders with Escrowed Shares in connection with all matters in this _Section 6.12,_ and all matters relating to the Escrow Agreement, as provided in _Section 2.05_. The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the EBC Shareholder Representative against any claims, damages or liabilities resulting from the EBC Shareholder Representatives performance of its duties under _Section 2.05_ and _Section 6.12(h)_ except for acts of fraud or willful breach of such sections. 

  

 SECTION 6.13 _Governance_. As of the Effective Time, the members of the board of directors of both Coconut Palm and the Surviving Corporation shall be seven (7) with Henry Luken, III as Chairman, with three designees of the board being appointed by shareholders of EBC or members of EBC management and with three designees of the board being appointed by Coconut Palm.

 SECTION 6.15 _Confidentiality; Public Announcements_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof until Closing, without the prior written consent of the other party, neither party will, and each will direct its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, make any public comment, statement or communication with respect to, or otherwise disclose or permit the disclosure of the existence of discussions regarding, a possible transaction between the parties or any of the terms, conditions, or other aspects of the Transactions or information provided by one party to the other without the written consent of the other party hereto.

 (c) If a party believes, on the advice of counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or the requirements of any applicable securities exchange or any national securities quotation system to make any disclosure prohibited by this _Section 6.15_, it shall first notify the other party and provide to the other party the content of the proposed disclosure, the reasons that such 

   ##### 

  

 

disclosure is required by law or regulation, and the time and place that the
disclosure will be made, and give the other party a reasonable opportunity to
review the proposed disclosure and comment thereon. 

   

 SECTION 6.16 _Due Diligence Review_. Coconut Palm shall be entitled to conduct, from the date hereof through a date which is four (4) weeks from the date hereof (the " _Due Diligence Termination Date_ "), a due diligence review of EBC which may include, without limitation, a review of the assets, properties, books, records, business, operations, government licenses, customer base, and financial condition of EBC, an audit of EBCs financial statements and an environmental assessment of the business premises (hereinafter referred to as " _Due Diligence Review_ "). EBC and its officers, employees and agents shall facilitate such review by Coconut Palm and its Representatives and shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by such reviewing party, and shall afford such reviewing party and its representatives an opportunity to examine such books, records and properties of EBC as may be requested. If the results of the Due Diligence Review are not satisfactory to Coconut Palm in its sole discretion, then Coconut Palm may elect in writing, on or prior to the Due Diligence Termination Date, to not close the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or to terminate this Agreement. Coconut Palms conduct or failure to conduct any Due Diligence Review shall not affect any representation or warranty of EBC or any of the Shareholders under this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.17 _Transfer Taxes_. EBC and Coconut Palm shall reasonably cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any sales, transfer, stamp, stock transfer, value added, use, real property transfer or gains and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.18 _Certain Claims_. As additional consideration for the issuance of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each of EBC stockholders hereby release and forever discharges, effective as of the Closing Date EBC and its directors, offices, employees and agents, from any and all rights, claims, demands, judgments, obligations, liabilities and damages, whether accrued or unaccrued, asserted or unasserted, and whether known or unknown arising out of or resulting from such stockholders (i) status as a holder of an equity interest in EBC; and (ii) employment, service, consulting or other similar agreement entered into with EBC prior to Closing, to the extent that the bases for claims under such agreement that survives the Closing arise prior to the Closing, provided, however, the foregoing shall not release any obligations of Coconut Palm set forth in this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 6.19 _No Securities Transactions_. Neither EBC nor any of its affiliates, directly or indirectly, shall engage in any transaction involving the securities of Coconut Palm prior to the time of the making of a public announcements of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Each of EBC and Coconut Palm shall provide the other party with a statement of estimated third party expenses incurred by it (" _Third Party Expenses_ ") at least ten (10) business days prior to the date of the Closing (the " _Statement of Expenses_ "), which statement shall be provided for informational purposes only. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 6.21 _Use of Coconut Palm Cash_. The parties acknowledge and agree that the cash held by Coconut Palm at the Closing, including its operating cash and the cash held in the Trust Fund (collectively, the " _Segregated Growth Funds_ "), shall as of the Effective Time and for all times following the Effective Time be subject the restrictions contained in this  _Section 6.21_. The Segregated Growth Funds shall generally be used for the purposes of achieving revenue growth, and for customary working capital purposes (specifically excluding the prepayment of any Indebtedness). The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of each applicable EBC 
lender(s) that the Segregated Growth Funds: (i) be held in newly established
segregated account(s); and (ii) not be considered or used as collateral
or security for any debt or encumbered by any debt. 

  

 SECTION 6.22 _Univision Registration Rights_. If at any time during the two (2) year period following the Effective Date the Surviving Corporation intends to file a Registration Statement, the Surviving Corporation shall provide Univision with written notice thereof at least fifteen (15) days prior to such filing. Univision shall have the right to include all or any part of the Registrable Shares in the registration contemplated by such Registration Statement provided it provides written notice of the number of its Registrable Shares to be included in the Registration Statement within 15 days of its receipt of such notice. The Surviving Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause all such Registrable Shares which the Surviving Corporation has been requested by Univision to register to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), to permit their sale or other disposition in accordance with the intended methods of distribution specified in the request of Univision; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Surviving Corporation shall have the right to postpone or withdraw any registration effected pursuant to this Section without any obligation to Univision whatsoever, in which event the Surviving Corporation shall provide prompt written notice thereof to Univision. 

  

 In connection with any registration under this _Section 6.22_ involving an underwritten offering, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to include any Registrable Shares in such registration unless Univision thereof accepts the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Surviving Corporation and the underwriters of the Surviving Corporation. If, in the opinion of the managing underwriter, it is appropriate because of marketing factors to limit the number of Registrable Shares to be included in the offering, then the Surviving Corporation shall be required to include in the registration only that number of Registrable Shares, if any, which the managing underwriter believes should be included therein. If the number of Registrable Shares to be included in the offering in accordance with the foregoing is less than the total number of shares which Univision has requested to be included, then Univision and other holders of securities entitled to be included in such registration shall participate in the registration pro rata based upon the total number of shares requested to be registered by them. 

  

 For the purposes of this Section the term "Registration Statement" means a registration statement filed by the Surviving Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for a public offering and sale of common stock of the Surviving Corporation (other than a Registration Statement on Form S-4, S-8 or their successors, or any other form for a limited purpose, or any registration statement covering only securities proposed to be issued in exchange for securities or assets of another corporation). For the purposes of this Section the term "Registrable Shares" shall include (i) those shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock issued to Univision under this Agreement, (ii) those shares of Coconut Palm Common Stock issuable to 

   ##### 

  

 

Univision upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Non-Voting Preferred
Stock issued to Univision under this Agreement and (iii) any securities
issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange
for, or in replacement of, securities referenced in clause (i) or (ii). 

   

 The Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any sales, brokers or underwriting commissions or other selling expenses incurred upon sale by Univision of any of the Registrable Shares but shall be responsible for all other registration expenses. The registration rights and obligations provided in this _Section 6.22_ shall not be assignable to any third party, except to an affiliate of Univision. 

  

 The Surviving Corporation shall prepare and promptly file with the SEC and promptly notify Univision of the filing of such amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or prospectuses contained therein as may be necessary to correct any statements or omissions if, at the time when a prospectus relating to the Registrable Shares required to be delivered under the Securities Act, any event shall have occurred as a result of which any such prospectus or any other prospectus as then in effect would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Surviving Corporation shall also advise Univision promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof, of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for that purpose and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be issued. If, after a Registration Statement becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation advises Univision that the Surviving Corporation, in its reasonable judgment, considers it appropriate that the Registration Statement be amended, Univision shall suspend any further sales of the Registrable Shares until the Surviving Corporation advises Univision that the Registration Statement has been amended provided that the Surviving Corporation promptly makes such amendment. 

  

 The Surviving Corporation shall maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement until such time (which period shall not be less than 120 days) as the Surviving Corporation reasonably determines that Univision will be able to sell all of its Registrable Shares then owned by Univision without the need for continued registration of the shares, in the three month period immediately following the termination of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement. 

  

 If the Registrable Securities owned by Univision Holder are included in any registration, Univision shall furnish the Surviving Corporation such information regarding itself as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with any registration referred to in this _Section 6.22_. Univision shall indemnify and hold harmless the Surviving Corporation and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, shareholders, representatives and each Person, if any, who controls (as defined in the Securities Act) the Surviving Corporation for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) resulting from any material omissions or misstatements of fact provided by Univision in writing to the Surviving Corporation expressly for use in connection with such registration and actually included in the Registration Statement used to register the Registrable Shares. The foregoing indemnity by Univision shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such liabilities if such settlement is effected without the consent of Univision (which consent shall not be 

   ##### 

  

 

unreasonably withheld or delayed), and in no event shall any indemnity by
Univision exceed the net proceeds (less underwriting discounts and selling
commissions) from the offering received by Univision. 

   

 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless Univision and its affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, shareholders, representatives and each Person, if any, who controls (as defined in the Securities Act) Univision for any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (joint or several) resulting from: (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (b) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (c) any violation or alleged violation by the Surviving Corporation of applicable securities laws, or any rule or regulation promulgated under applicable securities laws relating to the Registration Statement. 

  

 If any indemnification provided for in this Section is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party, in lieu thereof the indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, for the claim giving rise to such payments; _provided_  that no contribution by Univision, when combined with any amounts paid by Univision pursuant to any indemnity hereunder, shall exceed the net proceeds (less underwriting discounts and selling commissions) from the offering received by Univision. 

  

 The obligations of indemnity and contribution hereunder shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Shares in a Registration Statement under this Agreement. 

  

 The Surviving Corporation shall not, without the prior written consent of Univision which shall not be unreasonably withheld, enter into any agreement with any holder or prospective holder of any securities of the Surviving Corporation that would grant such holder or prospective holder any piggyback registration rights materially superior to those rights granted pursuant to this Agreement (it being understood that the grant of parity piggyback registration rights shall not require any such consent, and it further being understood that the grant of senior piggyback registration rights shall not require any such consent if such senior piggyback registration rights are granted to an investor in a material capital raising transaction for the Surviving Corporation in lieu of granting any demand registration rights to such investor). 

  

 SECTION 6.23 _Further Action; Approvals; Reasonable Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Transactions, and (ii) obtain from Governmental Authorities and third parties any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Coconut Palm or EBC, or any of

their respective subsidiaries, if applicable, in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (i) each of the parties hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act; and EBC agrees to make an appropriate filing with the FCC with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be requested by the FCC regarding EBCs FCC licenses; 

  

 (c) Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections, each of Coconut Palm and EBC shall have the right to review and approve in advance drafts of all applications, notices, petitions, filings and other documents made or prepared in connection with the items described in clauses (a) and (b) above, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, shall furnish to the other party such necessary information and assistance as such other party may reasonably request with respect to the foregoing and shall provide the other party with copies of all filings made by such party with any applicable Government Authority, and, upon request, any other information supplied by such party to a Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions. Any such information provided by each party and included in any regular filing shall be true and correct in all material respects and shall not omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statement therein not misleading.

 (c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section, Schedule or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms. 

  

 SECTION 9.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 9.05 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Coconut Palm, EBC and the Major EBC Shareholders each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) no party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, (b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or warranty relating itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions and, if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or to include representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the subject of any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 9.06 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement with the Exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except with the prior written consent of both Coconut Palm and EBC. 

  

 SECTION 9.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than _Section 6.04_ (Indemnification and Insurance) (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such persons). 

  

 SECTION 9.08 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed by EBC or the Major EBC Shareholders in accordance with the terms hereof and that, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, Coconut Palm shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, without the need to post a bond, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. 

  

 SECTION 9.09 _Governing Law/Dispute Resolution_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. 

  

 (a) The Parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement promptly by negotiation in good faith between executives who have authority to settle the dispute. Any Party shall give any other Party written notice of any dispute not resolved in this manner. Within seven days after delivery of such notice, the Party receiving notice shall submit to the other a written response thereto. The notice and the response shall include: (i) a statement of each Partys position(s) regarding the matter(s) in dispute and a summary of arguments in support thereof, and (ii) the name and title of the executive who will represent that Party and any other Person who will accompany that executive. The parties shall then agree to a non-binding mediation of the dispute, with a mediator to be selected by mutual consent of the parties. 

  

 (b) All reasonable requests for information made by one Party to any other shall be honored in a timely fashion. All negotiations conducted pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ (and any of the Parties submissions in contemplation hereof) shall be kept confidential by the Parties and shall be treated by the Parties and their representatives as compromise and settlement negotiations under the Federal Rules of Evidence and any similar state rules. 

  

 (c) If the matter in dispute has not been resolved within 30 days after the exchange of notices, then, all Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in the district court of Atlanta, Georgia. The parties hereto hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the district court of Atlanta, Georgia for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and 

   ##### 

  

 

irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named court, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by the above-named
court. 

   

 (d) Resolution of disputes under the procedures of this _Section 9.09_ shall be the sole and exclusive means of resolving disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein shall preclude the Parties from seeking in any court of competent jurisdiction temporary or interim injunctive relief to the extent necessary to preserve the subject matter of the dispute pending resolution under this _Section 9.09_. 

  

 SECTION 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.10_. 

  

 SECTION 9.11 _Fees and Expenses_. Each party shall bear its own fees and expenses incurred by it in connection with negotiation and preparation of and for this Agreement. Accordingly, EBC and Coconut Palm shall each pay one half of any filing fees required under the HSR. 

  

 SECTION 9.12 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Coconut Palm, EBC and the Major EBC Shareholders have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized or by themselves if individuals.
