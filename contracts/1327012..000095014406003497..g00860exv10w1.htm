</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), is dated as of April&nbsp;7, 2006,
among COCONUT PALM ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Coconut Palm</U>&#148;) and EQUITY

sections of this Agreement directly relating to those parties, certain shareholders of EBC who are
signatories to this Agreement (collectively, the &#147;<U>Major EBC Shareholders</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 18pt">RECITALS
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;The respective Boards of Directors of each of EBC and Coconut Palm deem it in the best
interests of their respective shareholders to consummate the merger, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, of EBC with and into Coconut Palm with Coconut Palm
being the surviving corporation (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), and such Boards of Directors have approved
this Agreement and declared its advisability, and, subject to completing its Due Diligence Review
and obtaining an adequate appraisal and fairness opinion as further described herein, the Board of
Directors of Coconut Palm (the &#147;<U>Coconut Palm Board</U>&#148;) has recommended that this Agreement be
adopted by Coconut Palm&#146;s stockholders, and the Board of Directors of EBC (the &#147;<U>EBC
Board</U>&#148;), intends to submit this Agreement for approval by EBC&#146;s shareholders;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;As an inducement to Coconut Palm entering into this Agreement, certain shareholders of EBC
are entering into this Agreement and are entering into a voting agreement simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, such shareholders
have agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote their shares of capital stock of EBC in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Upon consummation of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of EBC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Common
Stock par value $0.01 per share (the &#147;<U>Class&nbsp;A Common Stock</U>&#148;), and each issued and
outstanding share of EBC&#146;s Class&nbsp;B Common Stock par value $0.01 per share (the &#147;<U>Class&nbsp;B Common
Stock</U>&#148;) will be converted into the right to receive the Common Stock Consideration (as defined
below), and each issued and outstanding share of EBC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A Preferred Stock par value $0.01 per
share (the &#147;<U>Preferred Stock</U>&#148;) will be converted into the right to receive the Preferred
Stock Consideration (as defined below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization as
contemplated by Section&nbsp;368 of the Code, and further intend that the Merger qualify as a
&#147;reorganization&#148; pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code.

will receive stock worth $8,772 ($8.7719 x 1,000) for a cost of $7,500 ($7.50 x 1,000). However,
if the same option holder waited until immediately after the Effective Time to exercise the options

Registrable Shares to be included in the offering, then the Surviving Corporation shall be required

underwriter believes should be included therein. If the number of Registrable Shares to be
