2.1 _Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this

with and into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall thereupon cease. The Company shall continue as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate corporate existence of the
Company with all its property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate
of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the
Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
a Certificate of Merger as contemplated by the DGCL, together with any
required related certificates, filings or recordings with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later date and time as the Company
and Parent may agree upon and as is set forth in such Certificate of Merger
(such time, the " _Effective Time_ ").

2.4 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1_, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
occur as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than the second (2nd)
Business Day) after all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other
than conditions which by their terms are required to be satisfied or waived
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions)
 



 

10  shall have been satisfied or waived by the party entitled to the benefit of
the same, or at such other time and on a date as agreed to by the parties
in writing (the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall take place at or after
5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the Closing Date, at the offices of Dewey and
LeBoeuf LLP, 1301 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10019 or at such
other place as agreed to by the parties hereto.

2.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. Prior to the
Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent the resignation of each member
of the Board of Directors of the Company and, in the case of the officers of
the Company identified on _Section 2.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
resignation of each such officer, in each case, effective as of the Closing.
From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, or
until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal. 

2.6 _Effect on Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any Company Stockholder:

(a) _Treasury Shares_. At the Effective Time, (i) each share of Company Common
Stock held by the Company as treasury stock prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding, and no payment shall be made in respect
thereof, (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by Parent prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor and (iii) each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock
held by a Subsidiary of the Company or a Subsidiary of Parent shall be
converted into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the quotient of (A) the Cash Consideration plus the product of
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent Closing Date Share Price divided
by (B) the Parent Closing Date Share Price.

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 2.6(a)_, _Section 2.6(c)_ and _Section 2.6(d)_, and subject to any
Adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.10_, each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted into the right to
receive (i) $30.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "),
and (ii) that number of validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (the " _Stock
Consideration_ " and, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). From and after the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.6(b)_ shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
shares of Company Common Stock or shares of Company Common Stock that are in
non-certificated book-entry form (either case being referred to in this
Agreement, to the extent applicable, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in
consideration therefor, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares and any
dividends or other distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common
Stock become entitled in accordance with this _Article II_ upon the surrender
of such Certificate.

(c) _Changes to Stock_. If at any time during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall occur by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, split-up,
exchange or readjustment of shares or any stock dividend thereon with a record
date during such period, or any similar transaction or event, the Merger
Consideration, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items, as
the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) _Dissenting Shares; Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time  



 

11  and that are held by a Company Stockholder who has properly exercised such
Company Stockholders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (any
such shares being referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
_Section 2.6(b)_. Holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive
from the Surviving Corporation the amounts determined in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or otherwise effectively waives, withdraws or loses
the right for appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to
have been converted into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any notice or demand for appraisal or payment for shares of
Company Common Stock received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demand or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands.

2.7 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select an
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the exchange agent
(the " _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger for the purpose of exchanging
Certificates and non-certificated shares represented by book entry (" _Book
Entry Shares_ ") for the Merger Consideration. Parent will make available to
the Exchange Agent, at or prior to the Effective Time, (i) a number of shares
of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate Stock Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_, (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)_ and (iii) cash in
an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments of cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_ (such cash and shares of
Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record
(as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a Certificate (i) a letter
of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or by appropriate
guarantee of delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this
nature from a member of a national securities exchange, a member of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or a commercial bank or trust company
in the United States) for use in effecting delivery of shares of Company
Common Stock to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration issuable
and payable in respect thereof, and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)(i)_. Exchange of
any Book Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with Parents customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that
have been converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or compliance with Parents customary
procedure with respect to the exchange of Book Entry Shares, will be
entitled to receive (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which
shall be in non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.6_ and (ii) a check in the amount equal to the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
2.6_ and this _Article II_ , including dividends and other distributions
pursuant to  _Section 2.7(d)_ and cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.7(e)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid
dividends and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, represent
for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration and any
dividends and other distributions in accordance with _Sections 2.7(b)_ and
_2.7(d)_ , and any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Parent
Common Stock in accordance with _Section 2.7(e)_.



 

12 (c) _Certificate Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to or registered in the name of a person other than the person in whose
name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to the payment or registration thereof that the surrendered
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such payment or registration in the name of a
person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

(d) _Dividends and Distributions; Voting_.

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued pursuant to the Merger shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book Entry Shares are properly surrendered. Following such surrender, there
shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of such shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock, all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

(ii) Holders of unsurrendered Certificates shall be entitled to vote after
the Effective Time at any stockholders meeting of Parent the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder in respect of such
Certificates, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their
Certificates, and Parent agrees to treat holders of unsurrendered certificates
as holders of record of Parent for purposes of notice and voting.

(e) _Fractional Shares_.

(i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
entitled to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to
receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 2.7(e)_, a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock in an amount determined by multiplying the fractional
share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock owned by such holder at the
Effective Time) by the Closing Date Parent Closing Price. No such holder shall
be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

(ii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of shares of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of shares of Company Common Stock
without interest, subject to and in accordance with this _Section 2.7_.

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights_. The Merger Consideration paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon conversion of any shares
of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the
date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and
after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the  



 

13  Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
_Article II_.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash or Parent Common
Stock from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official to the extent
required by any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which
the Merger Consideration in respect of such Certificate would otherwise
irrevocably escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen,
defaced or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed and,
if reasonably required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in respect of such
lost, stolen, defaced or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.7(e)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7(d)(i)_, with respect to each share of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of
Company Common Stock (or with respect to all amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 2.6_) pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code, or under any other provision of applicable United States federal, state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of the
shares of Company Common Stock (or to the recipient of any amount payable
pursuant to _Section 2.6_) in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

2.8 _Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, if unvested, vest and become exercisable in full. Prior to and
effective as of the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action
necessary to terminate the Incentive Plans. Holders of all unexercised Company
Stock Options outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will
receive, in cancellation of their Company Stock Options, a cash payment from
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock provided for in
such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the sum of the
Cash Consideration plus that amount equal to the product of the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the Closing Date Parent Closing Price over (B) the exercise
price per share provided for in such Company Stock Option, which cash payment
shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any applicable United
States federal or state withholding Tax.

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall vest in full and the restrictions thereon shall lapse,  



 

14  and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that was
formerly Company Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.6_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, upon the lapsing of restrictions with respect to each share
of Company Restricted Stock, the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code and any applicable state or local Tax Law with respect to the lapsing
of such restrictions.

(c) _Company RSUs_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all remaining
forfeiture restrictions with respect to the Company restricted stock units
issued pursuant to the Incentive Plans (the " _Company RSUs_ ") shall expire
and the holders thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 2.6_;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable local Tax Law.

(d) The Company shall take all requisite action to effectuate the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 2.8_.

2.9 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the Effective Time,
the Company or Parent reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary or
desirable to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary or desirable to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

2.10 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, if the Total Stock Consideration is less than 40% of
the aggregate Base Merger Consideration, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
increased (with a corresponding reduction in the Cash Consideration) to the
extent necessary so that the Total Stock Consideration is equal to 40% of the

employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
trigger any payment of funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any
other obligation pursuant to, any Company Plan or any collective bargaining

substantially similar coverage) or materially impaired; or

(u)  _General_. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, authorize or enter into any agreement or otherwise make any
commitment to do any of the foregoing.

5.2 _No Solicitation_.

(a) _Alternative Transaction_. The Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit the directors,
officers, employees and Representatives of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
facilitate, induce or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal or
offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Transaction Proposal, or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, or cooperate in any way that would
otherwise reasonably be expected to lead to, any Alternative Transaction
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.2(a)_ by any of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees or
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ by
the Company. The Company will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and
each of the directors, officers, employees and Representatives of the Company
and its Subsidiaries to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and
all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction Proposal and will
enforce, and, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, will not
waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any
similar agreement) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
relating to any such Alternative Transaction Proposal. The Company will
promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement in connection with its consideration of any Alternative Transaction
Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information furnished prior to
the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of such Person by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company agrees that it
will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its directors, officers,
employees and Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this _Section
5.2_.

(b)  _Superior Proposal_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in _Section 5.2(a)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, in the event that the
Company receives after the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, a bona fide written Alternative Transaction
Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) to be, or to be reasonably likely to lead
to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may then take the following actions:

(i) Furnish any information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the Person or group (and their respective Representatives) making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal; _provided_ ,  



 

38  that (A) prior to furnishing any such information, it receives from such
Person or group an executed confidentiality agreement
containing confidentiality terms at least as restrictive as the terms
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2009, between
the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such information to such Person or
group, it furnishes such information to Parent; and

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group (and
their Representatives) with respect to such Alternative Transaction Proposal.

(c) _Notification_. In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in
_Sections 5.2(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(d)_ hereof, as promptly as practicable (and
in any event within one (1) Business Day) after receipt of any Alternative
Transaction Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or any inquiry
relating in any way to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with
written notice of the material terms and conditions of such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or
group making any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry
and a copy of all written materials provided to it in connection with such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition, the Company
shall provide Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
one (1) Business Day) with all information as is reasonably necessary to keep
Parent fully informed of all material oral or written communications
regarding, and the status and changes to the economic or other material terms
of, any such Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry, and shall
provide, as promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent a copy of all
material written materials (including material written materials provided by
email or otherwise in electronic format) provided by or to the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives in connection with such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall
provide Parent with seventy-two (72) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior
notice as is provided to the members of its Board of Directors) of any meeting
of its Board of Directors at which its Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to consider any Alternative Transaction Proposal;  _provided_ , that
nothing contained in this _Section 5.2(c)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall give or be deemed to give Parent the right to participate or otherwise
be a party to any meeting of the Companys Board of Directors or any
committee thereof.

(d) _Changes of Recommendation; Termination_. Neither the Board of Directors
of the Company nor any committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i)
(A) withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent) or
publicly propose to withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Board of Directors or any committee thereof of this
Agreement, or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Alternative Transaction Proposal (any action
described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Affiliates to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement, arrangement or understanding (A) constituting, or relating to, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or (B) requiring it (or that would require
it) to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this _Section 5.2(d)_ or in any other provision of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may, solely in response to a
Superior Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ and
concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, if all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (vi) are
met, as applicable:

(i) such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and
continues to be a Superior Proposal;

(ii) the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;



 

39 (iii) the Company has (A) provided to Parent five (5) Business Days
prior written notice which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a
Superior Proposal, (2) the material terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal (including the per share value of the consideration offered therein
and the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior
Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant
proposed transaction agreements with the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents, including the definitive
agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ ") (it being understood and agreed that any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal
shall require a new notice and a new five (5) Business Day period) and (3)
that it intends to terminate this Agreement, and the manner in which it
intends to do so, and (B) prior to terminating this Agreement, to the extent
requested by Parent, engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal;

(iv) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Proposal and taking into account any revised terms offered by Parent, the
failure to terminate this Agreement and enter into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

(v) the Company shall have complied with _Section 5.2(a)_ and shall not
have breached any of the other provisions set forth in this _Section 5.2_ in
any material respect; and

(vi) the Company pays all fees and expenses as required pursuant to _Section
7.3_ hereof.

(e) _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in _Section 5.2(d)_ or in any other provision of this
Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (other than in response to a Superior Proposal) if it
determines in good faith after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors that the failure to make such change would reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_
, that (i) the Company has provided to Parent five (5) Business Days prior
written notice advising Parent that it intends to effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for
the Company Adverse Recommendation Change and (ii) during such five (5)
Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in a manner that obviates
the need for the Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

(f) _Tender Offer Rules_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit
the Company or its Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company (other than a Company Adverse Recommendation Change which shall be
made only in accordance with _Section 5.2(d)_ or _5.2(e)_ , as applicable) if
the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to make such
disclosure would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
action taken or disclosure made under this _Section 5.2(f)_ shall not limit
or modify the effect that any such action or disclosure may have under any
other provision of this Agreement.

5.3 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Stockholders  Meetings_.

(a) _Registration Statement and Prospectus_.

(i) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with the SEC, the
Registration Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement to comply with the rules and
regulations promulgated  



 

40  by the SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and
the Company shall furnish all information concerning it as may reasonably be
requested by the other party in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement. The Company
will cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to Company Stockholders promptly
after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities
Act.

(ii)(A) All filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) all mailings to the Company
Stockholders in connection with the Merger and transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be subject to the prior review and comment by Parent. All
filings by Parent with the SEC in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Registration Statement, shall be subject to
the prior review and comment by the Company.

(iii) Each of Parent and the Company shall (A) as promptly as practicable
notify the other of (1) the receipt of any comments from the SEC and all
other written correspondence and oral communications with the SEC relating to
the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement (including the time when the
Registration Statement becomes effective and the issuance of any stop order
or suspension of qualifications of the Parent Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction) and (2)
any request by the SEC for any amendment or supplements to the Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement or for additional information with respect
thereto and (B) supply each other with copies of (1) all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the

Statement.

(iv) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement, so that neither of such documents
would include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the Company Stockholders.

(b) The Company shall duly give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following the date the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, for
the sole purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval or adjournment
thereof and shall, subject to _Section 5.2(d)_, (i) recommend to its
stockholders adoption of this Agreement and include in the Proxy Statement
such recommendation and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such
adoption and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or
postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure
that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided
to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the adoption of this Agreement,
or, if, as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is
originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such meeting;  _provided_ , that such adjournment or
postponement shall not exceed ten (10) Business Days. The Company shall ensure
that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and
conducted, and that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company
Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law, the
rules of the NYSE and the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Companys obligations pursuant
to the first sentence of this _Section 5.3(b)_ shall not be affected by (i)
the commencement, public  



 

41  proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal, qualification,
amendment or modification by the Board of Directors of the Company or any
committee thereof of such Board of Directors or such committees approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger. If a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred and thereafter the Board of
Directors shall recommend this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Reinstated
Recommendation_ "), the Company shall not hold or shall adjourn the Company
Stockholder Meeting until not less than ten (10) calendar days after the date
of such Reinstated Recommendation; _provided_ , that the Company Stockholder
Meeting shall be held as soon as practicable thereafter.

Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend that its stockholders vote
in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that
the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that the Company
Stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Company
Stockholders Meeting and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose
or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the
recommendation of its Board of Directors that Company Stockholders vote in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement.

5.4 [Intentionally Omitted.]

5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) _Access to Information_. Upon reasonable prior notice and subject to
applicable Law, from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and the officers, directors,
employees and Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
afford Parent and its officers, directors, employees and Representatives,
following notice from Parent to the Company in accordance with this _Section
5.5_, reasonable access during normal business hours to the officers,
employees, agents, properties, offices and other facilities, books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and all other financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request and,
during such period shall furnish, and shall cause to be furnished, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, to Parent, a copy of each report, schedule
and other document filed or received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the requirements of the federal securities laws or a Governmental
Authority, except, with respect to examination reports, as may be restricted
by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be obligated to disclose any information that, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (i) it is not legally permitted to
disclose or the disclosure of which would contravene any applicable Law or
Order or (ii) the disclosure of which would be reasonably likely to cause the
loss of any attorney-client or other legal privilege or trade secret
protection held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company shall
be entitled to have Representatives present at all times during any such
inspection. No investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.5_ or information
provided, made available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this _Section
5.5_ or otherwise shall affect any representations or warranties of the
Company or conditions or rights of Parent contained in this Agreement.

(b) _Confidentiality_. All information and materials provided pursuant to this
Agreement will be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement,
which will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

5.6 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

(a) _Governmental and Third Party Approvals_. Each of the parties shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (i)
preparing and filing as soon as practicable after the date hereof all forms,
registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the taking  



 

42  of such actions as are reasonably necessary to obtain any requisite
approvals, consents, Orders, exemptions or waivers by any Governmental
Authority or other third party, including filings pursuant to the HSR Act
with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of
the United States Department of Justice (and the preparation and filing, as
soon as reasonably practicable, of any form or report required by any other
Governmental Authority relating to antitrust, competition, trade, pre-merger
notification or other regulatory matters), (ii) obtaining all necessary
consents, approvals, authorizations or waivers from, and providing notices
to, third parties, including providing any further information as may be
required by such third party, (iii) the defending of any Actions challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to
have vacated or reversed any Order that would restrain, prevent or delay the
Closing and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
required by applicable Law necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. For purposes of clause (ii)
of the immediately preceding sentence, as to Real Property Leases, the Company
shall request, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, consents,
approvals, authorizations or waivers (which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent) from applicable third parties as to which
Parent notifies the Company that Parent has determined in good faith that it
is necessary to do so. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to the other
parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. In addition,
each of the parties hereto shall consult with the other with respect to,
provide any necessary information with respect to and provide the other (or
its counsel) copies of, all filings made by such party with any third party or
any other information supplied by such party to a third party in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) _Notification_. Each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In that regard, each party shall without
limitation use its commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) promptly notify
the other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or, in the
case of material oral communications, advise the other orally of) any material
communications from or with any Governmental Authority or other third party
with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
written (or any material proposed oral) communication with any such
Governmental Authority or other third party with respect to the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) to the extent
practical, not participate in any meeting with (A) any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (B) any third party (excluding Governmental Authorities)
with respect to any material consent, approval or waiver in connection with
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in
each case, unless it consults with the other in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority or other third party, as applicable,
gives the other the opportunity to attend and participate thereat, and (iv)
furnish the other with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the Company or Parent, as applicable, may reasonably request in connection
with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of information to any
such third party. Each of the Company and Parent may, as each deems advisable
and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material
provided to the other under this _Section 5.6_ as "outside counsel only".
Such material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials
(the Company or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel.

(c) _Divestitures_. In furtherance of the covenants set forth in _Section
5.6(a)_, if any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any domestic or foreign antitrust or competition Law
or if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other applicable
Governmental Authority challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or which would otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to resolve any such objections or Actions (or
threatened Actions) so as to permit consummation of the  



 

43  transactions contemplated hereby to close as soon as reasonably practicable,
including, becoming subject to, consenting to or agreeing to, or
otherwise taking any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its
respective assets or business (including that of its Affiliates) in any
manner (collectively, " _Divestitures_ "); _provided_ , that the obligations
of the Company under this _Section 5.6(c)_ shall be conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company
shall not take any of the foregoing actions without the prior written consent
of Parent, other than Divestitures related to assets or a business of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that are, individually or in the aggregate,
immaterial to the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in no event shall Parent or its Affiliates be required to become
subject, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to,
any Divestiture of assets or a business of Parent or its Subsidiaries.

5.7 _State Takeover Statutes_. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (a) take all reasonable action
necessary to ensure that no "fair price," "business combination," "control
share acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby and (b) if any "fair price," "business combination," "control share
acquisition" or other state takeover statute or similar Law becomes
applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms required by, or provided
for, in this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Law on the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (and until such
later date as of which any Action commenced during such six (6) year period
shall have been finally disposed of), Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and from and after the Upstream
Merger, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, honor and fulfill in
all respects the obligations (including both indemnification and advancement
of expenses) of the Company and its Subsidiaries under the certificate
of incorporation or any bylaws of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
indemnification agreements, in each case, in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time for the benefit of any of its current or former directors and
officers and any person who becomes a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time (the " _Indemnified
Parties_ "). In addition, for a period of six (6) years following the
Effective Time (and until such later date as of which any Action commenced
during such six (6) year period shall have been finally disposed of), Parent
shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company and
their respective Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation,
certificate of formation and bylaws and operating agreement, as applicable
(and other similar organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation, the
Surviving Company and their respective Subsidiaries to contain provisions
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation that
are at least as favorable, in the aggregate, as the indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or other similar organizational
documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and during such six (6) year period (and until such later date
as of which any Action commenced during such six (6) year period shall have
been finally disposed of), such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any respect, except as required by Law.

(b) _Insurance_. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time (and
until such later date as of which any Action commenced during such six (6)
year period shall have been finally disposed of), Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation (and from and after the Upstream Merger, the
Surviving Company) to, maintain in effect the current policies (whether
through purchase of a "tail end" policy or otherwise) of directors and
officers and fiduciary liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") maintained
by the Company, in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering each person covered by the DandO Insurance immediately
prior to the Effective Time (a true, correct and complete copy  



 

44  of which has been heretofore made available to Parent), on terms with
respect to the coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate than
those of the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (and from and after the
Upstream Merger, the Surviving Company) may substitute therefor policies of at
least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are
no less advantageous in the aggregate to former officers and directors of the
Company; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate annual premiums
for such policies at any time during such period will exceed 250% of the per
annum premium rate paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date
hereof for such policies, then Parent and the Surviving Corporation (and from
and after the Upstream Merger, the Surviving Company) shall only be required
to provide such coverage as will then be available at an annual premium equal
to 250% of such rate.

(c) _Successors_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Company
or any of their respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with,
or merge with or into, any other Person and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, in each case, Parent shall take such action as may be necessary
so that such Person shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth
in this _Section 5.8_.

(d) _Enforceability_. Each of the directors and officers or other persons who
is an Indemnified Party or a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance is intended
to be a third party beneficiary of this _Section 5.8_ with full rights of
enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Indemnified Parties (and
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the "tail"
policy referred to in paragraph (b) above) under this _Section 5.8_ shall be
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such
persons may have under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or
other equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification
agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each
other before issuing, and will provide each other the opportunity to review,
comment upon and concur with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to agree
on, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and shall not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), except as either party, after consultation with
outside counsel, may determine is required by applicable Law, court process or
by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or stock market if it has used commercially reasonable efforts to
consult with the other party prior thereto regarding the timing, scope and
content of any such press release or public statement; _provided_ , _however_
, that no such consultation shall be required to make any disclosure or
otherwise take any action expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_. In addition,
except (a) to the extent disclosed in or consistent with the Proxy Statement
in accordance with the provisions of  _Section 5.3_, (b) prior
communications consented to in accordance with this _Section 5.9_ or (c) as
expressly permitted by _Section 5.2_, neither party shall issue any press
release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the
other party or the other partys business, financial condition or results of
operations without the consent of such other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The parties agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be in the form agreed to by the parties.

5.10 _Listing_. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Parent Common Stock issuable under _Article II_ to be authorized for listing
on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing
Date.

5.11 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. 

(a) Parent, the Company, Merger LLC and Merger Sub intend that the Merger and
the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction
for United States federal income Tax purposes along with the other
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, shall qualify as a
"reorganization"  



 

45  within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and each shall, and shall
cause its respective Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Merger and the Upstream Merger to so qualify and shall file all
Tax Returns consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with (whether

they permit their Subsidiaries to, take any action, and Parent, the Company,
Merger LLC and Merger Sub shall not, and shall ensure that their Subsidiaries
do not, fail to take any action which action or failure to act would prevent
or impede, the Merger and the Upstream Merger, considered together as a single
integrated transaction for United States federal income Tax purposes along
with the other transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement, from
qualifying (or reasonably would be expected to cause the Merger and the
Upstream Merger, considered together as a single integrated transaction for

within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

to take, any action reasonably requested by Parent to minimize any current or
future Tax of the Company, Parent or any of their Affiliates resulting from

not adversely impact (i) the ability of counsel to provide the opinions
pursuant to _Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_ or (ii) the satisfaction

favorable than the severance pay practice provided during such period to

with the Company prior to the Closing Date to the extent it would not result
in duplication of benefits.

the Company), including terminating the Company 401(k) Plan prior to the
Effective Time, subject to the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan and applicable
Law and provided that such action does not preclude the immediate
participation of the Companys employees in any Section 401(k) plan
subsequently offered to such employees by Parent.

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall give any
third Person, other than the parties to this Agreement, any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.12_ and no
provision of this  _Section 5.12_ shall create any third party beneficiary
rights in any current or former employee, director, consultant or other
service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enforce the
provisions of this  _Section 5.12_ or any other matter related thereto or be
construed as an amendment of any employee benefit plan.

necessary to adopt and implement immediately following the Effective Time the

power or privilege. The rights and remedies provided herein shall
be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by either of the parties hereto without the
prior written consent of the other party. Any assignment in violation of
the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding two sentences,
this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

8.9 _Headings_. The headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement.

8.10 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, insofar as the foregoing can be
accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated
by the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
greatest extent possible.

8.11 _Failure or Delay Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or delay
on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in, any
breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. 

8.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE COMPANY, PARENT, MERGER SUB AND
MERGER LLC HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HERBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE COMPANY, PARENT OR MERGER SUB IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

8.14 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction over
such matter is vested in the federal courts, any court of the United
States located in the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute arises out
of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from such court, and (c)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than such
court.

8.15 _Incorporation of Exhibits_. The Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter and all Exhibits and schedules attached hereto and referred
to herein are hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof for all
purposes as if fully set forth herein.



 

54 8.16 _No Joint Venture_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
or construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of the
parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an
agent, employee or legal representative of any other party. No party shall
have the power to control the activities and operations of any other and
their status is, and at all times shall continue to be, that of independent
contractors with respect to each other. No party shall have any power or
authority to bind or commit any other party. No party shall hold itself out
as having any authority or relationship in contravention of this _Section
8.16_.
