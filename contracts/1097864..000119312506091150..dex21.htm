1.3 Retained Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers will retain, and Purchaser will not assume, or will be
deemed by virtue of the  



 

2  execution and delivery of this Agreement or of any other document delivered
at the Closing (except to the extent expressly provided in such other
document), or as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any such other document, to have assumed,
any Liabilities of any of the Sellers, whether primary or secondary, direct or
indirect, other than the Assumed Liabilities. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Liabilities of Sellers that Purchaser is not assuming
include the following (collectively, the "Retained Liabilities"):

(a) all Liabilities (other than Environmental Liabilities which are discussed
in clause (e) below) of LSI or any of its Subsidiaries arising or resulting
from the Fab Operations prior to the Closing or their use, manufacture, sale,
ownership, lease, license, operation, or disposition of the Specified Assets
prior to the Closing, or the performance or non-performance by LSI or any of
its Subsidiaries of obligations under the Fab-Related Contracts prior to the
Closing, except for any such Liabilities that are Assumed Liabilities pursuant
to clause (i), (ii), or (iv) of the definition thereof;

(b) all Liabilities of LSI or any of its Subsidiaries relating to Taxes with
respect to the Specified Assets, except for (i) Liabilities required to be
borne or paid by Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.5, (ii) Real Property Taxes,
the Liabilities for which will be determined solely by reference to Section
1.8(a)(i), and (iii) Personal Property Taxes, the Liabilities for which will
be determined solely by reference to Section 1.8(a)(ii);

(c) all Liabilities of LSI or any of its Subsidiaries arising from the SIP or
the SIP Bonds and Related Documents or the termination or unwinding of either
of them;

(d) all Environmental Liabilities arising or resulting from Sellers and any
of their Subsidiaries activities at and their operation of the Gresham
Facilities Real Property from August 5, 1995 until the Closing Date; and

(e) any Liabilities of LSI or any of its Subsidiaries under any Excluded
Contract, except as set forth in Section 12.3 or Section 12.4 or any of the
Ancillary Agreements.

1.4 Purchase Price. As consideration for the sale of Sellers right, title,
and interest in and to the Specified Assets to Purchaser, and the license of
the Licensed Intellectual Property to be granted to Purchaser and another
Subsidiary of ON pursuant to the IP License Agreement:

(a) on the Signing Date, Purchaser will pay to LSI, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the sum of ten million, five hundred thousand
dollars ($10,500,000) (the "Deposit");

(b) at the Closing, Purchaser will pay to LSI (without deduction or setoff of
any nature), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the additional
sum of seventy-nine million, five hundred thousand dollars ($79,500,000),
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.8(b) (as so adjusted, the
"Closing Cash Payment");



 

3 (c) at the Closing, Purchaser will assume the Assumed Liabilities by
delivering to LSI an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in the form of
Exhibit B (the "Assignment and Assumption Agreement"); and

(d) on the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the "Final
Installment Date"), Purchaser will pay to LSI (without deduction or setoff of
any nature), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the additional
sum of fifteen million, two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($15,225,000)
(the "Final Installment Payment") (provided, however, that if the Parties have
proceeded with the Partial Sale Alternative and if title to the Residual Real
Property has not been conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.3(f) on or
before the Final Installment Date, then instead of the payment described above
in this clause (d), Purchaser will pay to LSI (without deduction or setoff of
any nature), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, (i) the
additional sum of nine million, two hundred twenty-five thousand dollars
($9,225,000) on the Final Installment Date and (ii) the remaining sum of six
million dollars ($6,000,000) on the date when title to the Residual Real
Property is conveyed to Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.3(f)).

1.5 Transfer Taxes and Similar Charges. Purchaser will bear and pay, and (if
any of the Sellers pay) will reimburse Sellers for, any sales Taxes, use
Taxes, transfer Taxes, documentary charges, recording fees, filing fees (other
than income or franchise Taxes) that may become payable in connection with
the sale to Purchaser of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to the
Specified Assets, the assumption by Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities, or
any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. LSI and
Purchaser agree to file jointly, or cause to be filed jointly, all required
change of ownership and similar statements, to the extent joint filing is
permitted or required.

1.6 Allocation of Purchase Price

(a) The Parties will use their reasonable best efforts to agree upon an
allocation of the consideration referred to in Section 1.4 and Section 1.8
among the Specified Assets and the Licensed Intellectual Property (the
"Allocation") as soon as reasonably possible after the Closing Date. The
Allocation will be determined in a manner consistent with this Section 1.6 and
Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Purchaser
will provide a proposed allocation to LSI within 25 days after the Closing
Date, and LSI will deliver to Purchaser a notice setting forth any proposed
changes to such proposed allocation within 15 days after the delivery of such
proposed allocation to LSI. The Parties will negotiate in good faith to
resolve any disputed items, and if the Parties are unable to agree on the
Allocation within 15 days after LSIs delivery of such notice of proposed
changes to Purchaser, then the dispute will be arbitrated by Ernst and Young
and the resolution of such dispute by Ernst and Young will be conclusive and
binding on the Parties.

(b) The Allocation, as finally agreed or determined in accordance with Section
1.6(a), will be conclusive and binding upon the Parties for Tax purposes, and
no Party will make or permit any of its Subsidiaries to make any statement or
declaration to any taxing authority that is inconsistent with the Allocation,
except as provided below. No Party will take or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or representatives to take any position on any Tax return, with
any taxing  



 

4  authority, or in any judicial Tax proceeding that is inconsistent with the
Allocation except as required by a final determination within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any equivalent provision of any applicable
state or local law. Each of LSI and Purchaser will promptly provide the other
with any additional information required to complete Form 8594 if the filing
of such form is required. Each of LSI and Purchaser will timely notify the
other in the event of an examination, audit, or other proceeding regarding the
Allocation. Each of LSI and Purchaser will timely provide the other with such
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with any such
examination, audit, or other proceeding regarding the Allocation (it being
understood that the Party receiving such assistance will be required to
reimburse the Party providing such assistance for all expenses incurred in
providing such assistance).

1.7 Ancillary Agreements. At the Closing, Purchaser and LSI will enter into
(or cause their respective Subsidiaries to enter into) the following
additional agreements (along with the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the
"Ancillary Agreements"):

(a) a Wafer Supply and Test Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit D (the
"Wafer Supply Agreement");

 

(b) an Intellectual Property License Agreement in the form of Exhibit E (the
"IP License Agreement");

 

(c) a Transition Services Agreement in the form of Exhibit F (the "Transition
Services Agreement");

 

(d) a Facilities Use Agreement in the form of Exhibit G (the "Facilities Use
Agreement");

(e) a Master Nondisclosure Agreement in the form of Exhibit H;

(f) a Bill of Sale in favor of Purchaser in the form of Exhibit I; and

(g) if the Parties are proceeding with the Partial Sale Alternative, the
Ground Lease.

1.8 Prorations and Adjustments

(a) The following items will be prorated and adjusted between Purchaser, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, on the Closing Date in the
following manner (provided that such prorations and adjustments will be made
without duplication of any amount payable by Purchaser pursuant to Section
1.5):

(i) Real Property Taxes

(A) If the Gresham Facilities Real Property has been re-assessed on or prior
to the Closing Date for purposes of real property Taxes, then all city,
county, and state ad valorem property Taxes or assessments for the real
property tax year in which the Closing occurs ("Real Property Taxes") payable
by Sellers  



 

5  with respect to the Gresham Facilities Real Property will be prorated
between Purchaser and LSI, as of the Closing Date, based on the tax bill for
such tax year.

(B) If the Gresham Facilities Real Property has not been re-assessed on or
prior to the Closing Date for purposes of Real Property Taxes, then all Real
Property Taxes payable by Sellers with respect to the Aggregate Real Property
will be prorated between Purchaser and LSI, as of the Closing Date, based on
the Tax bill for such tax year and based on the Parties good faith best
estimate of the Real Property Taxes equitably allocable to the Gresham
Facilities Real Property and to the Excluded Land (and for purposes of such
estimate, the allocation of Real Property Taxes with respect to any parcel
included in the Gresham Facilities Real Property whose boundary is changed as
a result of the Lot Line Adjustment or Land Division, or the Residual Property
if the Lot Line Adjustment or Land Division has not been completed as of the
Closing Date, will be done on a per-acre basis). LSI will be liable for all
Real Property Taxes with respect to the Gresham Facilities Real Property (or
so allocated to the Excluded Land, if applicable) due and payable that are
attributable to any period prior to and including the Closing Date. Purchaser
will be liable for all Real Property Taxes with respect to the Gresham
Facilities Real Property (or so allocated to the Gresham Facilities Real
Property if applicable) due and payable that are attributable to any period
after the Closing Date.

(C) If any Real Property Taxes have not been set for any portion of the real
property tax year in which the Closing occurs, then the proration of such Real
Property Taxes will be based upon the Real Property Taxes for the preceding
real property tax year, and after the Closing such proration will be
readjusted between LSI and Purchaser when the tax bill for the real property
tax year in which the Closing occurs is available.

(ii) Personal Property Taxes. All personal property taxes levied or assessed
against the Fab Tangible Personal Property and the Other Specified
Manufacturing Equipment for the applicable personal property tax year in which
the Closing occurs ("Personal Property Taxes") will be prorated between
Purchaser and LSI, as of the Closing Date. LSI will be liable for all Personal
Property Taxes due and payable that are attributable to any period to and
including the Closing Date. Purchaser will be liable for all Personal
Property Taxes due and payable that are attributable to any period after the
Closing Date. If any Personal Property Taxes have not been set for any portion
of the applicable personal property tax year in which the Closing occurs,
then the proration of such Personal Property Taxes will be based upon the
Personal Property Taxes for the preceding applicable personal property tax
year, and after the Closing such proration will be readjusted between LSI and
Purchaser when the Tax bill for the applicable personal property tax year in
which the Closing occurs is available.

(iii) Utility Charges. All utility charges levied or assessed against the
Gresham Facilities Real Property will be prorated between Purchaser and LSI as
of the Closing Date. LSI will be liable for all such utility charges due
and payable  



 

6  that are attributable to any period to and including the Closing Date.
Purchaser will be liable for all such utility charges due and payable that
are attributable to any period after the Closing Date. LSI will request that
each utility meter on the Gresham Facilities Real Property be read by the
appropriate utility company immediately before the Closing Date. If any such
utility meter is not so read immediately before the Closing Date, then the
applicable utility charges will be initially prorated as of the Closing Date
based upon a per diem rate determined by reference to the utility charges for
the month immediately preceding the month during which the Closing occurs and
will be finally re-prorated as soon after the Closing Date as Sellers and
Purchaser can obtain such reading, after which LSI or Purchaser, as the case
may be, will promptly deliver to the other any amount owing as a result of
such re-proration.

(b) On the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date, LSI will
deliver to Purchaser a certificate (the "Closing Adjustments Certificate")
signed on behalf of LSI by an authorized officer of LSI and setting forth
LSIs good faith determination, without duplication of any amounts, of (i) the
aggregate amount, if any, due from LSI to Purchaser pursuant to each clause
of Section 1.8(a) (the "Purchaser Credit"), (ii) the aggregate amount, if any,
due from Purchaser to LSI pursuant to each clause of Section 1.8(a)
(the "Seller Credit"), (iii) the aggregate amount of any cash deposits held
by any public or private utility company for utility service to the Gresham
Facilities Real Property, which are to be assigned to Purchaser at the Closing
(the "Cash Deposits"), (iv) the aggregate amount of any Pre-Paid Expenses to
the extent attributable to any period after the Closing Date, (v) the
aggregate amount of the Assumed Accounts Payable, (vi) the Excess Spare
Parts Value, and (vii) the Accrued Paid Time Off Amount. If the net value
determined by subtracting (A) the sum of the Purchaser Credit and the Assumed
Accounts Payable and the Accrued Paid Time Off Amount from (B) the sum of the
Seller Credit, the Cash Deposits, the Pre-Paid Expenses, and the Excess Spare
Parts Value is positive, the Closing Cash Payment will be increased by such
amount. If such net value is negative, the Closing Cash Payment will be
reduced by the absolute value of such net value.

(c) All refunds and credits in respect of the Real Property Taxes and Personal
Property Taxes will be apportioned between Purchaser and LSI as follows: LSI
will be entitled to all refunds and credits (or any portion thereof)
attributable to any period to and including the Closing Date; and Purchaser
will be entitled to all refunds and credits (or any portion thereof)
attributable to any period after the Closing Date.

(d) The Parties are not currently aware of any other costs or expenses that
must be adjusted between them on the Closing Date, and if any such costs or
expenses arise or become known to them on or before the Closing Date and are
not otherwise addressed in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements,
they will be equitably adjusted between the Parties in accordance with
customary practice in Multnomah County, Oregon.

1.9 Closing. The closing of the purchase by Purchaser of Sellers right,
title, and interest in and to the Specified Assets (other than, if the Parties
proceed with the Partial Sale Alternative, the Residual Real Property) (the
"Closing") will take place at the offices of Cooley Godward LLP at 3175
Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, at a time and on a date to be

7  date designated by LSI in such notice will be at least two Business Days but

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood, however,
that the Closing will be subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing).

LSI represents and warrants to Purchaser that, except as set forth in the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule (it being understood that each item of disclosure
in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule with respect to any Section of this
Agreement will also be deemed to qualify any other Section of this Agreement

one of them) will have good and valid title to each item of the Fab Tangible
Personal Property and Other Specified Manufacturing Equipment, in each case
free and clear of any Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. At the
Closing, Purchaser will acquire all of Sellers right, title, and interest in
and to the Fab Tangible Personal Property and the Other Specified
Manufacturing Equipment, free and clear of any lien, security interest,

2.3 Sufficiency of Specified Assets; Raw Materials Inventory Levels

(a) To LSIs knowledge, upon the Closing, except for the rights of LSI and
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date under the Excluded Contracts, and any
Fab-Related Contracts and Fab-Related Government Permits that are not assigned
to Purchaser at Closing and except for Raw Materials, other consumables, and
utility services, in each case that are readily available in the marketplace,
the Specified Assets and the rights of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries as of
the Closing Date under the Ancillary Agreements will include substantially
all of the assets, properties, and rights needed by Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries, as of the Closing Date, to fulfill their obligations under the
Wafer Supply Agreement (including obligations related to yields and
specifications) for the first ninety (90) days after the Closing Date.

(b) At the Closing, the Fab Raw Materials Inventory will be substantially
consistent with levels of Raw Materials owned by Sellers and maintained at the
Gresham  



 

10  Facilities in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
of Sellers in operating the Fab, subject to the commercial availability of
such Raw Materials and taking into account the run rate of the Fab as of the
Closing.

2.4 Intellectual Property

(a) As of the Closing Date, Sellers (or one of them) will own the Fab
Intellectual Property free and clear of any Encumbrances, except for
Permitted Encumbrances and non-exclusive rights and licenses that were granted
prior to the Signing Date or that arise in the ordinary course of business
between the Signing Date and the Closing Date.

(b) To LSIs knowledge, since March 1, 2001, no Seller has received any
written claim of infringement of any Intellectual Property Rights of any
third party arising from Sellers utilization of the Fab Intellectual Property
or the Licensed Intellectual Property in connection with Sellers operation of
the Fab, except for infringement claims that would not reasonably be expected
to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(c) As of the Closing Date, LSI (or one or more Subsidiaries of LSI) will
have, by ownership or license or otherwise, all Intellectual Property Rights
necessary to grant the licenses of the Licensed Intellectual Property to
Purchaser and another Subsidiary of ON pursuant to the IP License Agreement.

(d) Other than in respect of Third-Party Intellectual Property, Product
Intellectual Property, Tooling, and Engineering Materials, the Fab
Intellectual Property, together with the Licensed Intellectual Property, the
Licensed Materials (as defined in the Wafer Supply Agreement), and Sellers
Intellectual Property Rights in the Fab Information and Excluded Information,
constitutes all of the material Intellectual Property Rights owned by LSI or
its Subsidiaries that are used or held for use by Sellers in their operation

software owned by Sellers that is also used by Sellers in their operation of
the Fab (as currently operated).

(f) Schedule 11 contains a complete and accurate list of all material
proprietary third-party software used by Sellers at the Gresham Facilities as
of the Signing Date in their operation of the Fab (other than third-party
software licensed under the terms of "shrink-wrap" licenses, "clickwrap"
licenses, and other licenses for software generally available on standard
terms including licenses for "open source" software).

2.5 Fab-Related Contracts. Prior to the Signing Date, LSI has made available
to Purchaser an accurate and complete copy of each Significant Fab-Related
Contract entered into prior to the Signing Date, as in effect on such date.
Each Significant Fab-Related Contract entered into prior to the Signing Date
is valid and in full force and effect as of the Signing Date. No Seller is in
material breach of any Significant Fab-Related Contract, and, to LSIs
knowledge as of the Signing Date, no other party to any such Significant Fab-
Related Contract is in material breach of such Significant Fab-Related
Contract. To LSIs knowledge as of the Signing Date, no event has occurred
that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a material
breach by any Seller or by any other party under any Significant Fab-Related
Contract. Except  



 

11  as would not reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect, since June 30, 2005, none of the Sellers has received written notice
that any party to any Significant Fab-Related Contract intends to cancel or
prematurely terminate such Significant Fab-Related Contract. All payments
required to be made by Sellers under the Fab-Related Contracts that are due on
or prior to the Closing Date will have been made in full as of the Closing
Date.

2.6 Government Permits. All of the material Fab-Related Government
Permits are current and in full force and effect. Sellers are in compliance
in all material respects with all such material Fab-Related Government
Permits. There are no lawsuits or other legal proceedings or, to LSIs
knowledge, governmental investigations, pending or, to LSIs knowledge,
overtly threatened that would result in the premature termination or material
impairment of any such material Fab-Related Government Permit. LSI has made
available to Purchaser copies of all material correspondence with Government
Authorities in LSIs or its Subsidiaries files relating to such material Fab-
Related Government Permits (including copies of official notices, citations,
or decisions in LSIs or its Subsidiaries files) with respect to which
Purchaser has made a specific written request to LSI that such correspondence
be made available.

2.7 Compliance with Legal Requirements. LSI and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance in all material respects with all material Legal Requirements
(other than Environmental Laws, which are addressed in Section 2.9) applicable
to the Fab Operations. No Seller has received any written notice from any
Government Authority alleging any failure by Sellers to comply with any Legal
Requirement applicable to the Fab Operations, except for any such notice
relating to a failure to comply that (i) has been cured or otherwise is no
longer pending or (ii) would not reasonably be expected to have a Seller
Material Adverse Effect.

2.8 Legal Proceedings; Governmental Orders. There is no lawsuit or other legal
proceeding or, to LSIs knowledge, governmental investigation, pending or, to
LSIs knowledge, being overtly threatened against LSI or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Signing Date that involves the Specified Assets or the
Fab Operations and would reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. There are no Governmental Orders outstanding against LSI or
any of LSIs Subsidiaries with respect to the Fab Operations arising from any
governmental investigation, lawsuit, or other legal proceeding against LSI or
any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be expected to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect.

2.9 Environmental Matters

(a) To LSIs knowledge, the Fab Operations are and for the preceding five
years have been in substantial compliance with all applicable Environmental
Laws. To LSIs knowledge, no conditions exist at the Gresham Facilities Real
Property that would by themselves reasonably be expected (i) to give rise to
liability on the part of Sellers or Purchaser to any Government Authority or
other third party pursuant to any Environmental Law or (ii) to materially
impair Purchasers ability to operate the Gresham Facilities Real Property, in
the same manner as it is currently operated, in substantial compliance with
Environmental Laws. The Gresham Facilities Real Property has not been listed
or, to LSIs knowledge, proposed for listing on the National Priorities List
established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or
any similar list maintained by the State of Oregon. To LSIs knowledge, the
 



 

12  Gresham Facilities Real Property is not subject to any material Encumbrance
(other than Permitted Encumbrances) that have attached to the Gresham
Facilities Real Property pursuant to any Environmental Law.

(b) To LSIs knowledge, no activities that have been or presently are being
conducted at the Gresham Facilities would reasonably be expected to give rise
to a material liability on the part of Sellers or Purchaser to any Government
Authority or other third party as a result of:

(i) the handling, storage, use, transportation, or disposal, or arranging for
transportation or disposal, of any Hazardous Substance by Sellers in, on,
under, or from the Gresham Facilities;

(ii) any emission, discharge, or release of any Hazardous Substance by
Sellers on or from the Gresham Facilities into or upon the air, surface water,
ground water, or land; or

(iii) any disposal, handling, manufacturing, processing, distribution, use,
treatment, or transport of any Hazardous Substances by Sellers on or from the
Gresham Facilities.

(c) To LSIs knowledge, no actual or threatened Discharges have occurred, and
no Contamination exists, at the Gresham Facilities Real Property that in
either case by themselves require, or would reasonably be expected to require,
notification, investigation, or remediation, or to result in material
liabilities or obligations of Sellers or Purchaser, pursuant to
any Environmental Laws.

(d) To LSIs knowledge, Sellers hold all registrations, permits, licenses, and
approvals required to be issued by or filed with any federal, state, or local
Government Authority pursuant to any Environmental Laws for the occupancy of
the Gresham Facilities by Sellers, the conduct of the Fab Operations, and the
ownership and use of the Specified Assets by Sellers ("Fab Environmental
Permits"). To LSIs knowledge: (i) any Fab Environmental Permits held by
Sellers are currently in full force and effect, (ii) Sellers are, and for the
preceding five years have been, in substantial compliance with the terms and
conditions of such Fab Environmental Permits, and (iii) no condition exists at
the Gresham Facilities Real Property that would prohibit Purchaser from being
in substantial compliance with applicable Environmental Laws when operating
the Gresham Facilities in the same manner as Sellers presently operate the
Gresham Facilities.

(e) No Seller has expressly assumed or undertaken any liability or corrective,
investigatory, or remedial obligation of any third party relating to any
Environmental Laws applicable to Sellers operation of and activities at the
Gresham Facilities Real Property that would reasonably be expected to result
in a material liability under any Environmental Law on the part of Sellers or
Purchaser to any Government Authority or other third party. 

(f) LSI has made available to Purchaser copies of any material environmental
reports, audits, permits, licenses, registrations, and other environmental,
health, and safety  



 

13  documents relating to the Specified Assets and the Gresham Facilities that
are in Sellers possession and that Purchaser has specifically requested
in writing from LSI.

Authority having jurisdiction over the Gresham Facilities Real Property with
respect to the Gresham Facilities Real Property that are delinquent.

responsibility of Sellers, in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

2.12 Authority; Binding Nature of Agreement. LSI has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement, and the execution, delivery, and performance
by LSI of this Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary action on
the part of LSI and its board of directors. Each Seller has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which such Seller is to become a party and to perform its
obligations under such Ancillary Agreements, and the execution, delivery, and
performance by each Seller of the Ancillary Agreements to which such Seller is

part of such Seller and its board of directors. No vote of the holders of
LSIs common stock is required to authorize the Contemplated Transactions.

valid and binding obligation of LSI, enforceable against LSI in accordance
with its terms, subject to (i) laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency, and the relief of debtors and (ii) rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief, and other equitable
remedies. Upon execution thereof, each of the Ancillary Agreements to which a
Seller is to become a party will have been duly executed and delivered by such
Seller and constitute the valid and binding obligation of such Seller,
enforceable against such Seller in accordance with its terms, subject to (a)
laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, and the relief
of debtors and (b) rules of law governing specific performance, injunctive
relief, and other equitable remedies.

2.13 Non-Contravention; Consents. The execution and delivery by LSI of this
Agreement and by Sellers of the Ancillary Agreements, the consummation by
Sellers of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
performance by Sellers of their obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, do not and will not: (a) conflict with or result in any
violation of any provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or
other charter or organizational documents of any Seller; or (b) assuming the
Consents referred to in Part 2.13 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule are
obtained, (i) contravene or result in a violation or breach by any Seller of
any Legal Requirement or any material Government Order applicable to any
Seller or any of the Specified Assets; (ii) result in any material breach of,

lapse of time, or both, would become a material default) by any Seller under,
result in the loss of any material rights by any Seller or give rise to any
material increased rights of any Person (other than Sellers) under, or give
to any Person any material rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, or

organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease, and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each Seller is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned
or leased by it or the operation of its business makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except to the extent that the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Other than Sellers, no
Subsidiary of LSI is presently engaged in the operation of the Gresham
Facilities.

2.15 Labor Matters. Neither LSI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
labor or collective bargaining agreement with respect to any of the Available
Employees and, to LSIs knowledge, there are no pending efforts to organize
the Available Employees for purposes of representation by a labor
organization. Prior to the Signing Date, LSI has delivered to Purchaser an
accurate and complete list of all Available Employees (as of the Signing
Date) by employee number and title and setting forth each such employees
annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable. All such Available
Employees have taken and passed a drug-screening test administered by or on
behalf of LSI or one of its Subsidiaries prior to commencing employment with
LSI or any of its Subsidiaries.

complete and correct list of the top ten suppliers of the Fab, based on
expenditures during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 and a complete and
correct list of the top ten suppliers of the Fab based on expenditures during
the six months ended December 31, 2005. Since June 30, 2005, no Seller has
received any written notice from any such supplier stating that such supplier
intends to materially and adversely change its relationship with such Seller

other Subsidiaries that are parties thereto, and the consummation by Purchaser
of the Contemplated Transactions and the performance by Purchaser and such
other Subsidiaries of their obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, do not and will not: (i) conflict with or result in any

other charter or organizational documents of ON or Purchaser or any of ONs
other Subsidiaries that is or will be a party to an Ancillary Agreement; (ii)
contravene, result in a violation or breach of any Legal Requirement or
Government Order applicable to ON or Purchaser or any of ONs other
Subsidiaries; or (iii) result in any material breach of, constitute a
material default (or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time,
or both, would become a default) under, result in the loss of any material
rights or give rise to any material increased rights of any Person (other
than ON or Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of ON) under, or give to any
Person any material rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, or
cancellation under, any ON Debt Instrument. All Consents required to be
obtained by ON or Purchaser on or prior to the Closing Date under any ON Debt
Instrument in connection with the Contemplated Transactions have been obtained
in writing prior to the Signing Date and remain in full force and effect, and
accurate and complete copies of such Consents have been delivered to LSI.

3.8 Due Diligence. Purchaser has had ample opportunity, including sufficient
time and access, to do a full and complete due diligence investigation of the
Gresham Facilities, the operations conducted at the Gresham Facilities, and
the other Specified Manufacturing Equipment prior to the Signing Date,
including with respect to (i) the Gresham Facilities Real Property, Fab
Tangible Personal Property, Fab Intellectual Property, and Significant Fab-
Related  



 

17  Contracts and (ii) financial, legal, employee, and environmental matters.
Purchasers due diligence investigation included visiting the
Gresham Facilities and conducting an environmental investigation of the
Gresham Facilities Real Property as Purchaser deemed appropriate. Purchasers
representatives have had the opportunity to meet with all employees of LSI
with whom they wished to meet.



   4. | EMPLOYEE MATTERS 
---|--- 

4.1 Employment of Available Employees. Purchaser agrees that Purchaser will
offer to employ all or substantially all of the Available Employees who are
employed by LSI or another Seller on the Closing Date, on the terms and
subject to the provisions set forth in this Section 4\. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing:

(a) Offers to Specified Employees. Within three days following the Signing
Date, LSI will deliver to Purchaser a list of all Available Employees by name,
title, and annual base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable. Within ten
days after the Signing Date, Purchaser will provide to LSI a list identifying
the Available Employees to whom Purchaser plans to offer employment as of the
Closing Date (the employees identified on such list being referred to in this
Agreement as the "Specified Employees"). If any Specified Employees
employment with LSI is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated prior to the
Closing, (i) LSI may, in its discretion, hire a replacement for such Specified
Employee, (ii) any replacement hired by LSI will not become an Available
Employee or a Specified Employee without Purchasers prior written approval,
and (iii) Purchaser will have the right, but not the obligation, to choose
another Available Employee who performs substantially the same job function
as the terminated employee (if there is any such Available Employee) to
replace the terminated employee as a Specified Employee. LSI will promptly
provide Purchaser with an updated list of Available Employees as necessary to
reflect any changes to the list delivered to Purchaser within three days the
Signing Date, including any change in the base salary or hourly wage rate of
any Available Employee; provided that an individual will be removed from the
list of Available Employees only if his or her employment with LSI or any of
its Subsidiaries is terminated or upon the mutual agreement of LSI and
Purchaser. Prior to the Closing, on a date mutually agreed by the Parties,
Purchaser will extend to each Specified Employee an offer of at-will
employment that, if accepted, would contemplate that such Specified Employee
would commence his or her employment with Purchaser at the Gresham Facilities
as of the Closing Date. Each such written offer of employment will be
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and will include the following
terms which Purchaser agrees to maintain through June 30, 2006 (collectively,
the "Minimum Employment Terms") (provided, however, that Purchaser will not
be required to guarantee employment to any Hired Employee and nothing herein
will preclude Purchaser, at any time after the Closing Date, from terminating
the employment of any Hired Employee for cause):

(i) Compensation. Purchaser will offer each Specified Employee base
compensation at least equal to such Specified Employees base compensation as
of the Closing Date, expressed either as base salary or as an hourly wage with
a comparable shift schedule, as set forth in the list of Available Employees
delivered by LSI to Purchaser on or prior to the Signing Date, as updated by
LSI during the Pre-Closing Period, provided that any change in the base salary
or hourly wage rate that may be made during the Pre-Closing Period is approved
by Purchaser or is otherwise permitted under Section 6.2(c)(v).

 



 

18 (ii) Past Service Credit. Except to the extent expressly prohibited
by Purchasers employee benefit plans, Purchaser will offer to credit each
Specified Employee with service equal to the amount of service credit such
Specified Employee has with LSI for purposes of vesting and eligibility (but
not accrued benefits) under Purchasers employee benefit plans, including
Purchasers qualified retirement plans, and for purposes of the rate of
accrual of the Specified Employees vacation time. The existing balances of
paid time off under LSIs employee benefit plans as of the Closing Date of
each Specified Employee who becomes a Hired Employee (collectively, the
"Accrued Paid Time Off") will be transferred to Purchaser without reduction.

(iii) Employee Benefits. Purchaser will offer the Specified Employees health
and welfare benefits that are comparable to the health and welfare benefits
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser. With respect to each
Specified Employee, Purchaser, except to the extent expressly prohibited by
its employee benefit plans, will offer to waive all waiting periods and pre-
existing condition exclusions for health and dental coverage to the extent
that the Specified Employee would have been entitled to coverage under the
corresponding plan of LSI immediately prior to the Closing Date, and will give
appropriate credit for all co-payments and deductibles paid or accrued under
LSIs medical, dental, and other health plans during the portion of the
calendar year 2006 that precedes the Closing Date.

(iv) Payment of Transition Bonuses. Purchaser will offer to pay the bonuses
earned by the Specified Employees who become Hired Employees, in amounts and
under the terms specified in LSIs bonus plan set forth in Exhibit L-1 (the
"Transition Bonus Program"), provided that Purchasers obligation to pay these
bonuses will be limited to paying the amounts funded by LSI pursuant to
Section 4.1(d) and to making such payments to Hired Employees in the amounts
instructed by LSI.

(v) Acceptance of Offers. If, at any time before the Closing, it appears that
any substantial portion of the Specified Employees may not accept Purchasers
employment offers such that the Employee Closing Condition might not
be satisfied, Purchaser will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that all or
substantially all of the Specified Employees accept Purchasers employment
offers.

(b) Retention of Hired Employees. Purchaser will hire each Specified Employee
who accepts the offer of employment and whose employment with LSI is not
terminated prior to the Closing, and each such Specified Employee who
commences employment with Purchaser on or after the Closing Date will be
referred herein as a "Hired Employee." Purchaser will promptly notify LSI of
each Specified Employee who becomes a Hired Employee. LSI will be responsible
for all compensation and benefits, including any severance benefits, for
Available Employees accrued before the Closing. Purchaser will be responsible
for all compensation and benefits, including any severance benefits, for
Hired Employees accrued or incurred after the Closing, except that LSI will
provide the necessary funding to Purchaser for the amounts to be paid by
Purchaser to Hired Employees pursuant to the Transition Bonus Program as
provided in Section 4.1(d). Purchaser will immediately notify LSIs Director
of Talent Acquisition and Management of any termination of the employment of
any Hired Employee occurring after Closing and on or before June 30, 2006 and
the basis for such  



 

19  termination. Purchaser will not terminate the employment of any Hired
Employee without cause on or before June 30, 2006.

(c) Employment Records. All of LSIs personnel files relating to the Available
Employees and the Specified Employees will be retained by and remain the
property of LSI. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, LSI
will provide to Purchaser a copy of each Specified Employees last performance
evaluation and any disciplinary matters arising with respect to any Specified
Employee in the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the Signing
Date.

(d) Hired Employee Bonuses. Purchaser will accurately report to LSI, on a
timely basis but no later than July 3, 2006, the information and data
described in Exhibit L-2, which is required by LSI to calculate bonuses earned
under the Transition Bonus Program. No later than July 7, 2006 LSI will
accurately report to Purchaser the bonus amounts earned as of June 30, 2006,
if any, by each Hired Employee and will deposit an amount of immediately
available funds equal to the aggregate amount of all such bonus payments
together with the employers corresponding FICA contribution amounts and
Medicare taxes into to an account or accounts designated by Purchaser in
writing (the "Bonus Account") to be used by Purchaser to pay such bonuses and
FICA contributions and Medicare taxes. Thereupon Purchaser will pay such
bonuses, in the amounts specified and to the extent funded by LSI, to the
Hired Employees as soon as possible and in no event later than July 15, 2006.

(e) Indemnification by Purchaser. From and after the Closing, Purchaser will
indemnify and hold harmless LSI from and against, and will compensate and
reimburse LSI for, any loss, damage, injury, liability, claim, demand,
settlement, judgment, award, notice requirement, payment, backpay, benefits
assessment, fine, penalty, tax, fee (including any legal fee, expert fee,
accounting fee, or advisory fee), charge, cost (including any cost of
investigation), or expense of any nature that is directly or indirectly
incurred by LSI or to which LSI may otherwise become subject (whether or not
relating to any third-party claim) and that arises from or as a result of, or
is directly or indirectly connected with:

(i) any interviews with Available Employees conducted by Purchaser, ON, or
any other Subsidiary of ON or any decision or determination made by Purchaser,
ON, or any other Subsidiary of ON regarding which Available Employees will
become Specified Employees or will receive employment offers from Purchaser,
ON, or any other Subsidiary of ON;

(ii) the employment of the Hired Employees by Purchaser, ON, or any of ONs
other Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date;

(iii) the termination of any Hired Employees employment with Purchaser, ON,
or any of ONs other Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date;

(iv) Purchasers breach of any of its obligations under this Section 4.1;

(v) Purchasers failure to provide notice, pay, or benefits or otherwise
comply with the WARN Act relating to any of the Available Employees; or



 

20 (vi) any suit or other legal proceeding related to any matter set forth in
clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this Section 4.1(e) (including any
legal proceeding commenced by LSI for the purpose of enforcing any of its
rights under this Section 4.1(e));

_provided, however,_ that Purchaser will not be obligated to indemnify or hold
harmless LSI with respect to any claim asserted against LSI by any Hired
Employee based upon the Transition Bonus Program (except to the extent that
any such claim arises from Purchasers breach of any of its obligations under
Section 4.1(a)(iv) or Section 4.1(d)).

(f) Indemnification by LSI. From and after the Closing, LSI will indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser from and against, and will compensate and reimburse
Purchaser for, any loss, damage, injury, liability, claim, demand, settlement,
judgment, award, notice requirement, payment, backpay, benefits assessment,
fine, penalty, tax, fee (including any legal fee, expert fee, accounting fee,
or advisory fee), charge, cost (including any cost of investigation), or
expense of any nature that is directly or indirectly incurred by Purchaser or
to which Purchaser may otherwise become subject (whether or not relating to
any third-party claim) and that arises from or as a result of, or is directly
or indirectly connected with:

(i) the employment or termination by LSI or any of its Subsidiaries of any
Retained Employee;

(ii) the employment of the Available Employees by LSI or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date;

(iii) the termination of any Available Employees employment with LSI or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date;

(iv) LSIs breach of any of its obligations under this Section 4.1 or Section
4.3;

(v) the Transition Bonus Program (except to the extent that a claim arises
from Purchasers breach of any of its obligations under Section 4.1(a)(iv) or
Section 4.1(d)); or

(vi) any suit or other legal proceeding related to any matter set forth in
clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) of this Section 4.1(f) (including any
legal proceeding commenced by Purchaser for the purpose of enforcing any of
its rights under this Section 4.1(f));

_provided, however,_ that LSI will not be obligated to indemnify or
hold harmless Purchaser with respect to any claim that arises from or relates
to any interviews with Available Employees conducted by Purchaser, or any
decision or determination made by Purchaser regarding which Available
Employees will become Specified Employees or will receive employment offers
from Purchaser.

For purposes of Section 4.1(e) and this Section 4.1(f), a claim will be deemed
to have been incurred on the date on which medical, dental, vision, life,
disability, or other related health or  



 

21  welfare treatment or services was rendered and not the date of the
submission of a claim related thereto.

(g) Employees on Leave or Disability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 4: Purchaser will not be required to offer
employment to any Specified Employee who, at the Closing Date, is on short-
term or long-term disability or long-term or short-term leave unless and until
such Specified Employee returns to active work from such leave or disability,
at which time he or she will be offered employment by Purchaser in accordance
with Section 4.1(a); and Purchaser will have no obligation or liability for
compensation or benefits of any such Specified Employee with respect
to periods prior to the time he or she accepts such offer of employment and
becomes a Hired Employee.

4.2 Termination at Closing. Effective as of the Closing Date, LSI will
terminate the employment of each Hired Employee. After the Closing Date, LSI
will not have any responsibility or obligation to Purchaser with respect to
any Hired Employee, except for LSIs obligation to report accurately to
Purchaser the earned bonus amounts to be paid to Hired Employees pursuant to
the Transition Bonus Program and to fund the amount of such payments pursuant
to Section 4.1(d) and except as otherwise expressly set forth herein.

4.3 Hired Employee 401(k) Plan Accounts. LSI will (a) cause each Hired
Employee to vest in his or her interest under LSIs section 401(k) plan, (b)
provide each Hired Employee with the right to receive a distribution of his or
her interest under the LSI section 401(k) plan to the extent permitted by
applicable Legal Requirements, and (c) provide each Hired Employee with an
election to rollover his or her vested interest to a Purchaser section 401(k)
plan. Purchaser will take all actions reasonably necessary to permit the Hired
Employees to make a direct rollover of his or her entire account balance
(including participant loans, to the extent not in default) to Purchasers
section 401(k) plan, to the extent permitted by such plan of Purchaser. As a
condition to Purchasers acceptance of any Hired Employees rollover of his
or her vested interest, Purchaser will be entitled to receive from LSI an
officers certificate or an opinion of counsel (with customary qualifications)
to the effect that the LSI section 401(k) plan either (i) has received a
recent favorable determination letter as to its qualification under the Code,
and nothing has occurred since the date of such letter which could reasonably
be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or (ii) substantially
complies by its terms with the relevant qualification provisions of the Code
and LSI will make such changes to the plan as are requested by the Internal
Revenue Service as a condition of such qualification.

4.4 Nonsolicitation. Purchaser agrees that, during the period commencing on
the Signing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the earlier of (a)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10 or (b) the Closing
Date, neither ON nor any of its Subsidiaries (including Purchaser) will
solicit for employment with ON or Purchaser (or any other Person) or hire any
of the Retained Employees who remain employed by LSI or any Subsidiary of LSI.
LSI agrees that, (x) during the period commencing on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, LSI will not solicit
for employment with LSI or any other Person or hire any of the Hired
Employees who remain employed by ON or Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of
Purchaser, and (y) during the period commencing on the Signing Date and ending
on the Closing Date, LSI will not solicit for employment with LSI or any
other Person (other than Purchaser) any of the Specified Employees (it being
understood open position  



 

22  postings, job requisitions, general employment advertisements, and similar
internal or external notices published or circulated by LSI in the ordinary
course of business will not be considered a violation of this clause (y)).
However, this Section 4.4 will not be construed to prohibit any Party from
placing general advertisements or similar notices that are not targeted
specifically at employees of the other Parties or from engaging any
recruiting firm or similar organization to identify or solicit persons for
employment on behalf of such Party, as long as such recruiting firm or
organization is not instructed to target any employees of the other Parties.

4.5 WARN Act. If Purchaser breaches its obligations under Section 4.1, then
without limiting Purchasers obligations and liabilities under Section
4.1(e), Purchaser will be responsible for, and will indemnify and hold
harmless LSI with respect to, any notices, payments, benefits, fines,
penalties, backpay, and damages required under the WARN Act relating to the
Available Employees.



   5. | REAL PROPERTY MATTERS 
---|--- 

5.1 Completion of Land Survey. Purchaser will use its best efforts to cause
the Survey to be completed, and to cause copies of the definitive ALTA Survey
report to be delivered to the Parties, as soon as possible after the Signing
Date. LSI will lend its full and timely support and cooperation to Purchaser
with respect to the completion of the ALTA Survey as soon as possible after
the Signing Date. However, neither LSI nor any of its Subsidiaries will be
required to become subject to any Liabilities, or to incur any out-of-pocket
costs or expenses or to pay any consideration to any Person, pursuant to this
Section 5.1.

5.2 Lot Line Adjustment and Land Division

(a) The Gresham Facilities Real Property is anticipated generally to be the
real property with the same or substantially the same boundaries as those
indicated in the drawing attached as Schedule 1. Such real property is
currently comprised of four legal parcels that can be conveyed at Closing
without the need for a lot line adjustment or land division (the "Existing
Legal Parcels"), and certain partial parcels that will need to be adjusted
or created by means of the Lot Line Adjustment or the Land Division (as
defined below) in order to be legally conveyable (the "Residual Real
Property").

(b) Promptly after the Signing Date, Sellers will diligently pursue its
application, and will take all additional required action, under the
ordinances, rules, and regulations of the City of Gresham, and, as applicable,
the County of Multnomah (collectively, the "Applicable Authorities") to either
(i) legally adjust the boundaries of the Gresham Facilities Real Property so
as to have the same or substantially the same boundaries as those indicated in
the drawing attached as Schedule 1 pursuant to Chapter 92 of the Oregon
Revised Statutes, and thereby to cause the Residual Real Property to be
legally conveyable, or (ii) under the circumstances described in the
penultimate sentence of this Section 5.2(b), cause the Residual Property to be
legally partitioned or subdivided into one or more separate legal lots. LSI
anticipates accomplishing the foregoing by means of an adjustment to the lot
lines of adjacent lots owned by LSI Gresham Sub as permitted under Section
92.010(7)(b) of the Oregon Revised Statutes (the "Lot Line Adjustment"). If
the Applicable Authorities make a final, non-appealable determination that
they will not permit the Lot Line Adjustment, then upon obtaining knowledge  



 

23  of such decision, LSI will promptly undertake the required action to create
such separate legal lot (or lots) by means of partition or subdivision of
the larger parcel of property owned by Sellers and of which the Gresham
Facilities Real Property is a part. This creation of such separate legal lot
(or lots) by partition or subdivision is hereinafter referred to as the "Land
Division." 

(c) Purchaser will lend its full and timely support and cooperation to Sellers
(both before and, if applicable, after Closing) with respect to the Lot Line
Adjustment. If the Applicable Authorities will not permit the creation of one
or more separate legal lots for the Gresham Facilities Real Property by Lot
Line Adjustment, Purchaser will lend its full and timely support and
cooperation to Sellers with respect to the Land Division. Neither Purchaser
nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to become subject to any
Liabilities, or to incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses or to pay
any consideration to any Person, pursuant to this Section 5.2.

(d) If, during the Pre-Closing Period, Purchaser receives notice of any
Encumbrance on the Gresham Facilities Real Property that was not previously
disclosed or known to Purchaser and that would cause the condition in Section
8.6 not to be satisfied, Purchaser will promptly notify LSI thereof in
writing and LSI will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Encumbrance to be removed prior to the End Date.

5.3 Partial Sale Alternative. If the End Date has been extended pursuant to
Section 10.1, but neither the Lot Line Adjustment nor the Land Division has
been accomplished by June 30, 2006, then the Parties will proceed as
follows (the "Partial Sale Alternative"):

(a) at the Closing, LSI will cause LSI Gresham Sub to execute and deliver to
Purchaser a duly executed and acknowledged special warranty deed, in the form
attached to this Agreement as Exhibit C, in favor of Purchaser with respect to
the Existing Legal Parcels (the "First Deed");

(b) at the Closing, LSI Gresham Sub and Purchaser will enter into a ground
lease with respect to the Residual Real Property (the "Ground Lease"), the
terms of which will be negotiated reasonably and in good faith by the Parties
prior to the Closing and will be designed to put the Parties in as close to
the same position, economically and otherwise (subject to Section 1.4(d)), as
they would have been in if the Closing had occurred and the Parties had not
proceeded with the Partial Sale Alternative (and if the Parties are unable to
agree on any material terms in the Ground Lease, the dispute will
be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator appointed by
JAMS, who will have the power to determine such material terms based upon the
foregoing);

(c) at the Closing, LSI Gresham Sub and Purchaser will enter into a memorandum
of Lease with respect to the Residual Real Property (the "Memorandum of
Lease");

(d) at the Closing, LSI will deliver to Purchaser affidavits, each in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit J and such other documents in favor of
the Title Company (but not in favor of Purchaser) and relating to title
insurance as are customarily provided by a seller and by a lessor to a title
company in Multnomah County, Oregon;



 

24 (e) after the Closing, the Parties will cooperate to complete the Lot
Line Adjustment or the Land Division as quickly as reasonably possible; and

(f) the closing of the purchase of the Residual Real Property (the
"Subsequent Closing") will take place at a time and on a date to be designated
by LSI in writing that is at least two Business Days but not more than ten
Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Section 5.3(g) (except for the condition
set forth in Section 5.3(g)(iii), which by its nature can be satisfied only at
the Subsequent Closing), and at the Subsequent Closing: 

(i) LSI will deliver to Purchaser a recorded lot line adjustment deed or a
partition or subdivision plat, evidencing the City of Greshams final
approval of the Lot Line Adjustment or Land Division, as the case may be,
after the expiration of the appeals period, if any, or entry of a final
judgment upon any appeal affirming the Lot Line Adjustment or Land Division;

(ii) LSI will cause LSI Gresham Sub to execute and deliver to Purchaser a duly
executed and acknowledged special warranty deed, in the form attached to this
Agreement as Exhibit C, in favor of Purchaser with respect to the Residual
Real Property (as the same may have been reconfigured during the Lot Line
Adjustment or Land Division process (provided that the Residual Real Property
will have the same or substantially the same boundaries as those indicated in
the drawing attached as Schedule 1) so that the same is legally conveyable)
(the "Second Deed");

(iii) LSI will deliver to Purchaser an affidavit in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit J and such other documents in favor of the Title Company (but not
in favor of Purchaser) and relating to title insurance as are customarily
provided by a seller to a title company in Multnomah County, Oregon;

(iv) if, and only if, the Subsequent Closing occurs after the Final
Installment Date, Purchaser will deliver or cause to be delivered to LSI the
$6,000,000 payment referred to in Section 1.4(d), and upon receipt of such
payment, LSI will deliver to Purchaser a receipt for this payment;

(v) the Memorandum of Lease will be terminated; and

(vi) the Ground Lease will be terminated.

(g) LSIs obligations under clause (f) above and Purchasers obligation to
make the $6,000,000 payment referred to in Section 1.4(d) at the Subsequent
Closing, will be subject to the following conditions:

(i) the Title Company must be committed to issue to Purchaser an ALTA Owners
Policy of Title Insurance with the standard printed exceptions deleted,
containing such endorsements as the Title Company has, prior to the date on
which the Subsequent Closing occurs, agreed in a binding written commitment
in favor of Purchaser and in a binding written commitment in favor of LSI (or
LSI  



 

25  Gresham Sub), to issue, all dated the date and time of the recording of the
Second Deed in an amount not less than $6,000,000, insuring Purchaser as owner
of fee simple title to the Residual Real Property subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances and any exceptions caused by, or resulting from actions or
inactions of, ON or Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of ON;

(ii) no Governmental Order preventing, prohibiting, or making unlawful the
sale of the Residual Real Property to Purchaser will have been issued by any
United States federal or state court or, to the extent the failure to comply
with such Governmental Order would result in the imposition on Purchaser or ON
of a material fine, sanction, or penalty, by any other federal, state, or
local Government Authority and remain in effect; and no United States federal,
state, or local Legal Requirement that makes the sale of the Residual Real
Property to Purchaser illegal will have been enacted or adopted and remain in
effect (except where the failure to comply with such Legal Requirement would
not result in the imposition on Purchaser or ON of a material fine, sanction,
or penalty); and

(iii) the deliveries and actions set forth in Section 5.3(f) will be completed
substantially concurrently.

5.4 Title Insurance. LSI will pay the "standard coverage" portion of the title
insurance premium for each title insurance policy referred to in this
Agreement insuring Purchaser, and Purchaser will pay the additional premium
for extended coverage and the cost of the endorsements requested by Purchaser
with respect to each such title insurance policy.



   6. | PRE-CLOSING COVENANTS OF LSI 
---|--- 
6.1 Access. Subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and to
applicable Legal Requirements, during the period from the Signing Date
through the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period"), LSI will, after receiving
reasonable advance notice from Purchaser, give Purchaser reasonable access
(during normal business hours) to (a) the Gresham Facilities Real Property
and to Sellers personnel and books and records relating to the Specified
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Available Employees, for the purposes
of enabling Purchaser (i) to further investigate, at Purchasers sole
expense, the Specified Assets and the Available Employees, and (ii) to verify
the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2; and
(b) such reasonably available additional existing financial and operating
data and other information relating to the Specified Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities and the operation of the Fab as Purchaser may from time to time
reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that except as provided in Section 4
or solely in connection with the performance and administration of the
engineering services provided by LSI to Purchaser to evaluate the feasibility
of the Trench 2 process, Purchaser will not (without LSIs approval, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed) contact
or otherwise communicate with any of the Available Employees.

6.2 Conduct of Fab Operations. Except (i) as expressly permitted by this
Agreement or described in Part 6.2 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, (ii) as
necessary to comply with any Legal Requirement, or (iii) with the express
prior written consent of Purchaser  



 

26  (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed),
during the Pre-Closing Period:

(a) LSI will, and will cause the other Sellers to, conduct the Fab Operations
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (except to
the extent that the manufacture or testing of new or different products
requires different practices);

(b) LSI will, and will cause the other Sellers to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain good relations with the Available Employees and the
parties to the Significant Fab-Related Contracts;

(c) LSI will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to:

(i) sell, transfer, assign, lease, license, or otherwise dispose of any
interest in any of the Specified Assets, except (A) to another Seller or (B)
for the use of Fab Raw Materials Inventory and the license of Fab Intellectual
Property in connection with the manufacture and sale of products in the
ordinary course of business;

(ii) knowingly create or cause to exist, or knowingly and voluntarily permit
to be created, any Encumbrance (other than Permitted Encumbrances,
disregarding for this purpose clause (v)(B) of the definition thereof) on any
Specified Asset in favor of any third party or assign ownership of, or grant
any exclusive right or license to, any Licensed Intellectual Property to
any Person other than another Subsidiary of LSI;

(iii) terminate (other than upon the expiration thereof in accordance with
its terms), amend in any material respect, or assign to any Person other than
another Seller any Fab-Related Contract, or waive or release any material
post-Closing right or claim of any Seller under any of the Fab-Related
Contracts, or enter into any Significant Fab-Related Contract or extend
beyond the Closing Date the term of any Significant Fab-Related Contract;

(iv) enter into any compromise or settlement of any claim, legal proceeding,
or governmental investigation relating to the Specified Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities if such compromise or settlement would be reasonably expected
to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect; or

(v) make any increase in the level of compensation or benefits applicable to
any Specified Employees (except as required under the terms of applicable

one or more of the following conditions may be waived by Purchaser, in whole
or in part, and (ii) by proceeding with the Closing, Purchaser will be deemed
to have waived any of such conditions that remain unsatisfied):

8.1 Accuracy of Representations. Those representations and warranties of LSI
set forth in Section 2 that refer specifically to and by their terms are made

material respects", "in any material respect", "material" or "materially",
except to the extent such limitation applies to a list expressly required by
such representation or warranty to be set forth in the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule or a Schedule to this Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that, for
purposes of this Section 8.1, any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of LSI will be disregarded if the facts or circumstances
constituting or giving rise to such inaccuracies (considered collectively) do
not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of determining whether such facts or
circumstances have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, none of the following
will be taken into account: (i) any adverse effect (including any claim,
litigation, disruption of business relationships, or loss of employees)
arising from or attributable to (A) the announcement or pendency of any of the
Contemplated Transactions, or (B) changes after the Signing Date affecting
the semiconductor industry or the U.S. economy generally; (ii) the taking of
any action required by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements;

unlawful the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions will have been
issued by any United States federal or state court or, to the extent the
failure to comply with such Governmental Order would result in the imposition
on Purchaser or ON of a material fine, sanction, or penalty, by any other
federal, state, or local Government Authority and remain in effect as of the
Closing Date; and no United States federal, state, or local Legal Requirement
that makes consummation of the Contemplated Transactions illegal will have
been enacted or adopted and remain in effect as of the Closing Date (except
where the failure to comply with such Legal Requirement would not result in
the imposition on Purchaser or ON of a material fine, sanction, or penalty).

8.6 Title

(a) If the Parties do not proceed with the Partial Sale Alternative, the Title
Company will be committed to issue to Purchaser an ALTA Owners Policy of

binding written commitment in favor of Purchaser and in a binding written
commitment in favor of LSI (or LSI Gresham Sub), to issue, all dated the date
and time of the recording of the Deed in an amount not less than $12,000,000,
insuring Purchaser as owner of fee simple title to the Gresham Facilities Real
Property subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and any exceptions caused by,
or resulting from actions or inactions of, ON or Purchaser or any other
Subsidiary of ON.

(b) If the Parties proceed with the Partial Sale Alternative, (i) the Title
Company will be committed to issue to Purchaser an ALTA Owners Policy of
Title Insurance with the standard printed exceptions deleted, containing such

and time of the recording of the First Deed in an amount not less than
$6,000,000, insuring Purchaser as owner of fee simple title to the Existing
Legal Parcels subject only to Permitted Encumbrances and any exceptions caused
by, or resulting from actions or inactions of, ON or Purchaser or any
other Subsidiary of ON; and (ii) the Title Company will be committed to issue
to Purchaser an ALTA Leasehold Policy of Title Insurance with the standard
printed exceptions deleted, containing such endorsements as the Title Company
has, prior to the Closing Date, agreed in a binding written commitment in
favor of Purchaser and in a binding written commitment in favor of LSI (or LSI
Gresham Sub), to issue, all dated the date and time of the Closing in an

interest in the Residual Real Property subject only to the Lease and Permitted
Encumbrances and any exceptions caused by, or resulting from actions or
inactions of, ON or Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of ON. 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
the condition described in this Section 8.6 will be deemed satisfied on the
End Date if the Title Company is unable to so commit solely as a result of
Purchasers failure to use reasonable efforts to obtain such title insurance
commitment, Purchasers failure to use reasonable efforts to satisfy the
requirements of the applicable title insurance commitment, Purchasers failure
to use  



 

31  reasonable efforts to obtain the ALTA Survey, or Purchasers creation of
liens or exceptions to title other than Permitted Encumbrances.

same boundaries as those indicated in the drawing attached as Schedule 1;
provided, however, that if neither the Lot Line Adjustment nor the Land
Division has been so accomplished as of June 30, 2006, then the Parties will
proceed in accordance with Section 5.3, in which case this condition will be
deemed to have been waived automatically by Purchaser.

have occurred, and no circumstance or condition will have arisen, that has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
operational capability and performance of the Gresham Facilities, such that,

normal operating conditions to perform the obligations of Purchaser under the
Wafer Supply Agreement in material compliance with the standards and
requirements set forth in the Wafer Supply Agreement.

   10. | TERMINATION 
---|--- 

10.1 Right to Terminate Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated prior to
the Closing:

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Parties;

(b) by either LSI or Purchaser (by delivery of a written termination notice in
accordance with Section 10.2) at any time after the End Date if the Closing
has not taken place on or before the End Date ( _provided, however,_ that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) will not be
available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement was the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to
occur prior to the End Date);

(c) by LSI (by delivery of a written termination notice in accordance with
Section 10.2) if (i) there has been a breach on the part of Purchaser of any
of its covenants such that the condition set forth in Section 9.2 would not be
satisfied as of the  



 

33  time of such breach, (ii) LSI has given written notice of such breach to
Purchaser, (iii) at least twenty days have elapsed since the delivery of such
written notice to Purchaser, and (iv) such breach has not been cured in all
material respects;

(d) by Purchaser (by delivery of a written termination notice in accordance
with Section 10.2) if (i) there has been a breach on the part of LSI of any of
its covenants such that the condition set forth in Section 8.2 would not be
satisfied as of the time of such breach, (ii) Purchaser has given written
notice of such breach to LSI, (iii) at least twenty days have elapsed since
the delivery of such written notice to LSI, and (iv) such breach has not been
cured in all material respects; or

(e) by Purchaser if (i) it receives notice of any Encumbrance on the Gresham
Facilities Real Property that is not a Permitted Encumbrance and that would
reasonably be expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
Purchaser delivers a notice to LSI, within five Business Days after Purchaser
receives such notice, stating Purchasers intention to terminate this
Agreement due to such Encumbrance, (iii) such Encumbrance has not been removed
and LSI has not taken action to mitigate such Encumbrance such that such
Encumbrance no longer has a Seller Material Adverse Effect, (iv) a period of
ten (10) days has elapsed since the delivery of such notice to LSI and LSI has
not delivered a notice to Purchaser stating that LSI will diligently pursue
removal of such Encumbrance, and (v) Purchaser delivers a written termination
notice in accordance with Section 10.2 to LSI within three Business Days after
the expiration of such ten-day period.

If Purchaser does not deliver a written termination notice to LSI pursuant to
Section 10.1(e) within three Business Days after the expiration of the ten-day
period referred to in Section 10.1(e), then the Encumbrance referred to in
Section 10.1(e) will be deemed to be a Permitted Encumbrance. For purposes of
this Agreement, "End Date" means May 31, 2006; provided, however, that if on
May 31, 2006, the conditions set forth in Section 8.7 and Section 9.7
(Completion of Lot Line Adjustment or Land Division) have not been satisfied
and each of the other conditions set forth in Sections 8 and 9 has been
satisfied or waived (other than the conditions set forth in Sections 8.4, 9.4,
and 9.5, which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, and other
than the condition set forth in Section 8.6), the End Date will be
automatically extended to June 30, 2006.

10.2 Termination Procedures. If either Purchaser or LSI wishes to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, such Party will deliver to the other
Party a written termination notice stating that such Party is terminating this
Agreement and setting forth a brief statement of the basis on which such Party
is terminating this Agreement.

10.3 Effect of Termination. Upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1, neither Party will have any obligation or other Liability to
the other Party, except that: (a) the Parties will remain bound by the
provisions of Section 4.4, this Section 10.3, and Section 13 and by the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement; (b) neither Party will be
relieved of any Liability for any breach of its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or its obligation to take any
other action required to be taken by  



 

34  such Party at or before the Closing; and (c) LSI will be entitled to retain
the Deposit if, and only if:



     | (i) | either Party has terminated this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.1(b); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the Closing has not taken place by the End Date because of
(A) breaches of, or inaccuracies in, the representations made by Purchaser in
Section 3, as a result of which the Closing condition in Section 9.1 was not
satisfied as of the End Date, (B) breaches of the covenants made by Purchaser
in this Agreement, as a result of which the Closing condition in Section 9.2
was not satisfied as of the End Date, or (C) the occurrence of an event,
circumstance, or condition that has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, as a result of which the Closing
condition in Section 9.8 was not satisfied as of the End Date; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | all of the conditions set forth in Section 8 were
satisfied on the End Date, other than (x) the condition set forth in Section
8.4, which by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing, and (y) any other
condition whose failure to be satisfied results solely from Purchasers
material breach of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

If Purchaser is not entitled to a refund of the Deposit pursuant to clause (c)
of the preceding sentence, then without limiting any right or remedy that LSI
might otherwise be entitled to exercise with respect to any breach by
Purchaser of any provision of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement,
LSI will be entitled to retain the Deposit free of any claims by Purchaser. If
LSI is not entitled to retain the Deposit pursuant to this Section 10.3, LSI
will refund the Deposit to Purchaser within five days after the termination of
this Agreement, unless there is a good faith dispute regarding whether LSI is
entitled to retain the Deposit.

claims and (ii) based on such facts and circumstances, as of the Signing Date
such breach or breaches would have reasonably been expected to give rise to
Damages exceeding $5,000,000 in the aggregate. 

11.6 Right of Subrogation. To the extent an Indemnified Party receives any
payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages, and such
Indemnified Party could have recovered or could later have recovered all or a
part of such Damages from a third party (including any insurer) based on the
underlying claim or demand asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then
such Indemnifying Party will be entitled to exercise, and will be subrogated
to, any rights and remedies of such Indemnified Party (including rights of
indemnity, rights of contribution, and other rights of recovery) to the
extent necessary to permit such Indemnifying Party to recover from such third
party the amount of such payment. Such Indemnified Party will take such
actions as such Indemnifying Party may reasonably request for  



 

37  the purpose of enabling such Indemnifying Party to perfect or exercise such
Indemnifying Partys right of subrogation hereunder.

11.7 Insurance; Set-off. The amount of any Damages for which indemnification
is provided under Section 11.2 or Section 11.4 will be net of any amounts
actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies. Except
as may be otherwise expressly provided in any Ancillary Agreement, no Party
nor any of its Subsidiaries will have any right to set-off any payment
due pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement against any unresolved
indemnification claim.

11.8 Exclusive Remedy

(a) From and after the Closing, the rights to assert indemnification claims
and receive indemnification payments pursuant to Section 11 will be the sole
and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by any Party or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 2 or Section 3 or in any Partys Closing Certificate or the
nonperformance of any covenant set forth in Section 6 or Section 7 of this
Agreement, except that this exclusive remedy does not preclude any Party or
any of its Subsidiaries from bringing an action for common law intentional
fraud against a Person who has committed such fraud.

(b) Except as expressly provided in Section 11.2, no Seller and no current or
former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, or advisor of any
Seller will have any personal or individual Liability of any nature to
Purchaser with respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
made by LSI in Section 2\. The Parties acknowledge that (A) no current or
former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, or advisor of any
Seller has made or is making any representations, warranties, or commitments
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
(B) except as expressly provided in Section 2 and LSIs Closing Certificate,
no Seller has made or is making any representations or warranties whatsoever
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied, and (C)
except for the representations and warranties expressly provided in Section 2
and LSIs Closing Certificate, Purchaser is not relying or has relied on any
representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE
FOREGOING, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED
IN SECTION 2 AND LSIS CLOSING CERTIFICATE, THE FAB TANGIBLE PERSONAL
PROPERTY, FAB INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OTHER SPECIFIED MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT,
AND LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WILL BE SOLD, TRANSFERRED, OR LICENSED "AS
IS," "WHERE IS," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND SELLERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

(c) Except as expressly provided in Section 11.4, neither Purchaser nor any
current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, or
advisor of ON or Purchaser will have any personal or individual Liability of
any nature to LSI with respect to any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty made by Purchaser in Section 3\. The Parties acknowledge that (A) no
current or former stockholder, director, officer, employee, affiliate, or
advisor of ON or Purchaser has made or is making any representations,
warranties, or commitments whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied,  



 

38  (B) except as expressly provided in Section 3 and Purchasers Closing
Certificate, Purchaser has not made or is not making any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, and (C) except for the representations and warranties expressly
provided in Section 3 and Purchasers Closing Certificate, LSI is not
relying and has not relied on any representations or warranties whatsoever
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied.

11.9 Procedures for Indemnification Claims

(a) Claim Notices. A Person (the "Indemnified Party") that wishes to assert
an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 11.2 or Section 11.4 will
promptly deliver to the Person liable for such indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") a written notice (a "Claim Notice") of any Matter which
the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could give rise to a right
of indemnification under this Agreement (it being understood that no Claim
Notice may be delivered unless the Indemnified Party has reasonably
determined, on the basis of facts known to such Indemnified Party, that the
claim set forth in such Claim Notice is valid and not a speculative claim and
has given or is reasonably likely to give rise to Damages of the Indemnified
Party) and, to the extent known:

(i) a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances giving
rise to the claim for indemnification; and

(ii) a reasonably detailed description of, and a good faith estimate of the
total amount of, the Damages actually incurred to the date of such Claim
Notice as a result of such claim;

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event of any claim for indemnification
hereunder resulting from or in connection with any Matter brought or asserted
by any third Person (a "Third Party Claim") against an Indemnified Party, such
Indemnified Party will give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party (x) not
later than ten Business Days prior to the time any response to the Third Party
Claim is required, if reasonably practicable, and (y) in any event within five
Business Days following receipt of notice thereof; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that failure to give such notification will not affect the rights to
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(b) Third Party Claims. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its
own expense, to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by written notice
within 30 calendar days. If the Indemnifying Party so elects:

(i) the Indemnifying Party will employ counsel selected by it and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party (provided that such counsel has no
conflict of interest) and will assume and defend any such Third Party Claim
at its own costs and expense, subject to Section 11.3(b) and Section 11.5(b);

(ii) as long as the Indemnifying Party diligently pursues such defense, the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify the
Indemnified Party against any attorneys fees or other expenses of counsel
incurred on behalf of such Indemnified Party in connection with such Third
Party  



 

39  Claim; however, the Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in
(but not control) such defense at its own expense;

(iii) the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will cooperate in all
aspects of such Third Party Claim, including by providing the other Party or
its agents with reasonable access to employees and officers (including as
witnesses) and all books, records, and other documents and materials that are
under the control of such Party or any of such Partys Subsidiaries,
advisors, or representatives and that are reasonably required for such Partys
use in contesting such Third Party Claim;

(iv) the Indemnifying Party will not compromise, settle, adjust, or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless the judgment or
proposed settlement by its terms: (A) obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay
the full amount of the Liability in connection with such Third Party
Claim without reimbursement from or contribution by the Indemnified Party;
(B) releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim; (C) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon
the Indemnified Party; and (D) does not otherwise adversely affect the
Indemnified Party;

(v) the Indemnified Party will not compromise, settle, adjust, or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned), unless the judgment or
proposed settlement by its terms: (A) obligates the Indemnified Party to pay
the full amount of the Liability in connection with such Third Party Claim
without reimbursement from or contribution by the Indemnifying Party; (B)
releases the Indemnifying Party completely in connection with such Third Party
Claim; (C) does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the
Indemnifying Party; and (D) does not otherwise adversely affect
the Indemnifying Party;

(vi) subject to the provisions of clause (iv) and clause (v) of this Section
11.9(b), the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party will (and will cause
its respective Subsidiaries to) execute such documents and take such other
actions as the other Party may reasonably request for the purpose of
facilitating the defense of, or any settlement, compromise, or adjustment
relating to, such Third Party Claim.

If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party will be entitled to defend such Third
Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling,
compromising, adjusting, or consenting to the entry of any judgment
with respect to such Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , the Indemnified
Party will not compromise, settle, adjust, or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned), unless the judgment or proposed settlement
by its terms: (A) obligates the Indemnified Party to pay the full amount of
the Liability in  



 

40  connection with such Third Party Claim without reimbursement from or
contribution by the Indemnifying Party; (B) releases the Indemnifying
Party completely in connection with such Third Party Claim; (C) does not
impose an injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnifying Party;
and (D) does not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnifying Party.

(c) Environmental Claims. If Purchaser receives any claim, including any
inquiry or request for information from a Government Authority, pertaining to
a matter that Purchaser believes, in good faith, might result in an
Environmental Liability for which Purchaser is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2 (an "Environmental Claim"), Purchaser will promptly
deliver a Claim Notice to LSI pursuant to Section 11.9(a). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 11.9(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement,
Purchaser will have the duty to respond to such Environmental Claim, at its
sole cost and expense, until such time as Purchaser is able to establish that
such Environmental Claim would reasonably be expected to result in an
Environmental Liability for which Purchaser is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2. The duty to respond includes any and all
investigations or requests for information required by any Government
Authority. Purchaser and LSI will mutually cooperate in response of any such
Environmental Claim. LSI and Purchaser each will have a continuing right to
participate, at its own cost, and provide its own response to any such
Environmental Claim.

11.10 Tax Effects of Indemnity Payments. All indemnification payments made
pursuant to this Section 11 will be treated for all Tax purposes as
adjustments to the consideration paid with respect to the Specified Assets and
the Licensed Intellectual Property.



   12. | POST-CLOSING COVENANTS 
---|--- 

12.1 Access to Information. At all times after the Closing Date, each Party
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, at the other Partys reasonable
request, give the other Party and its advisors and representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the first
Partys books and records to the extent related to the operation of the Fab
prior to the Closing, and will furnish copies thereof, at the requesting
Partys expense, for legitimate business reasons including (a) in connection
with Matters and other regulatory or legal proceedings involving the operation
of the Fab prior to the Closing and (b) verifying the accuracy
of calculations made pursuant to this Agreement (including, for example, the
prorations and adjustments contemplated by Section 1.8); provided that such
access does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of such Party or
its Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
will provide LSI with reasonable access to, and permit LSI at its sole expense
to make copies of, any and all Fab Information in existence as of Closing, as
reasonably requested by LSI. 

12.2 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing Date, each Party will and
will cause its Subsidiaries to, to the extent reasonably requested by another
Party, execute and deliver such documents and instruments and take such other
actions as the other Party may reasonably request in order to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

41 12.3 Certain Contracts and Permits

(a) With respect to any Long-Term Supply Contract that is not assigned to
Purchaser at the Closing, during the period from the Closing Date until (i)
LSI (or the Subsidiary of LSI that is party to the Long-Term Supply Contract)
is able to terminate such Long-Term Supply Contract without incurring any
termination fees, penalties, or similar Liabilities and (ii) Purchaser has
made alternative arrangements for the continued supply of the products or
services provided pursuant to such Long-Term Supply Contract, Purchaser will,
at its own expense, act as the agent of LSI (or its Subsidiary) in submitting
forecasts to the supplier, in ordering, purchasing, and paying for products
and services, and in otherwise carrying out LSIs (or its Subsidiarys) rights
(other than termination rights) and obligations under the Long-Term Supply
Contract. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the products and services it
purchases as LSIs (or LSIs Subsidiarys) agent under a Long-Term Supply
Contract will be used to produce products that will be sold, or
provide services that will be rendered, to LSI under the Wafer Supply
Agreement, and that Purchaser will not be entitled to any separate
reimbursement from LSI for amounts paid by Purchaser as LSIs (or LSIs
Subsidiarys) agent to a supplier under a Long-Term Supply Contract other
than the amounts paid by LSI to Purchaser pursuant to the Wafer Supply
Agreement. Each of LSI and Purchaser will, and will cause its respective
Subsidiaries to, take such actions, in connection with any such Long-Term
Supply Contract, as are reasonably necessary so that LSI and its Subsidiaries
will remain at all times in compliance in all material respects with their
obligations under such Long-Term Supply Contracts and to prevent the
imposition of termination fees, penalties, or other Liabilities (other than
routine payment obligations associated with the purchase of products and
services) on LSI or any of its Subsidiaries, unless LSI has given its prior
written consent thereto. In addition, Purchaser will defend, indemnify, and
hold harmless LSI and its Subsidiaries from and against, all Damages incurred
or sustained by LSI and its Subsidiaries that arise or result from any failure
by Purchaser (or any other Subsidiary of ON) to comply with the terms of any
such Long-Term Supply Contract (including payment terms) when carrying out
LSIs (or its Subsidiarys) rights and obligations under the Long-Term Supply
Contract. LSI will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, amend any
such Long-Term Supply Contract or waive any material right thereunder during
the period referred to in the first sentence of this Section 12.3(a) without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(b) Except as may be otherwise provided in the Ancillary Agreements, with
respect to each Shared Contract that is not replaced by a Contract of
Purchaser as of the Closing Date, the Parties will enter into an alternative,
lawful arrangement under which Purchaser (or one or more other designated ON
Subsidiaries) will have the material benefits of such Shared Contract that
are applicable to the operation of the Fab, during the period from the Closing
Date until a Replacement Contract is entered into or one year after the
Closing Date, whichever occurs first.

(c) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, LSI will, and will
cause the other Sellers to, use commercially reasonable efforts to make
available to Purchaser the material benefits of any Fab-Related Contract
(other than the Long-Term Supply Contracts) or Fab-Related Government Permit
that was not assigned to Purchaser as a result of the failure to obtain any
Consent required for the assignment of such Fab-Related Contract to
Purchaser. In  



 

42 omitted and filed separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.  
---|--- 

addition, Purchaser will cooperate with and reasonably assist Sellers, as
Sellers may reasonably request, regarding the termination and winding up of
any such Fab-Related Contracts that are not assumed by Purchaser.

(d) After the Closing Date, Purchaser will make reasonable accommodations to
permit the continued use of the Gresham Facilities Real Property by [*] in
substantially the same manner as [*] is using the Gresham Facilities Real
Property immediately prior to the Closing Date, except as provided below. If
Purchaser gives LSI at least [*] advance notice that Purchaser desires to have
[*] cease using any portion of the Gresham Facilities Real Property, LSI will
exercise all rights it has, if any, to terminate (prior to the end of this
[*] period and diligently during any period thereafter, as necessary) any
rights [*] may have under the [*] to use such portion of the Gresham
Facilities Real Property; _provided_ that Purchasers compliance with its
obligations under this Section 12.3(d) will not constitute consent to the use
and occupancy of the Gresham Facilities Real Property for purposes of the
parenthetical at the end of Section [*].

(e) If, prior to the Closing, LSI (or a Subsidiary of LSI) has not paid the
portion of the purchase price of the [*] that remains unpaid as of the
Signing Date, then after the Closing Date: (i) Purchaser will be responsible
for carrying out properly the final acceptance tests in accordance with the
terms of the Seller Contract related to the [*], (ii) Purchaser will notify
LSI when final acceptance of the [*] in accordance with the terms of such
Seller Contract has occurred, and (iii) upon receipt of such notice, LSI will
pay to [*] the remaining portion of the purchase price for the [*]. If
Purchaser does not provide final acceptance of the [*] in accordance with the
terms of the Seller Contract related to the [*], LSI will be responsible for
returning the [*] to [*] and LSI will be entitled to (and Purchaser will
assign to LSI the right to receive) any refund, credit, or other compensation
that may be owed or provided by [*] as a result thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the amounts payable by
LSI or one of its Subsidiaries under a purchase order that LSI or one of its
Subsidiaries intends to place during the Pre-Closing Period, for a [*] for use
in the Fab (the [*]) will not be an Assumed Liability, but rather LSI will
pay such amounts when they become due provided that: (i) Purchaser will be
responsible for accepting delivery, arranging for installation, and certifying
final acceptance of the [*] in accordance with the terms of such purchase
order, and (ii) Purchaser will keep LSI apprised of the status of the
delivery, installation, and acceptance of the [*] so that LSI can determine
when payment of such amounts is due. For avoidance of doubt, the purchase
order for the [*] will be a Fab-Related Contract. If Purchaser properly
refuses to accept the [*] in accordance with the terms of the purchase order
therefor, LSI will be responsible for returning the [*] to the supplier
thereof and LSI will be entitled to (and Purchaser will assign to LSI the
right to receive) any refund, credit, or other compensation that may be owed
or provided by the supplier thereof as a result thereof.

(g) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the [*] is a Fab-Related Contract.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, LSI will pay the monthly [*]
and the monthly [*] (as such terms are defined in the [*]) up through the
expiration of the [*] (as such term is defined in the [*]) of the [*], and the
obligation to pay such monthly [*] and monthly [*] will not be an Assumed
Liability.

(h) Each Party will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, execute and deliver
such instruments and to take such actions as are reasonably necessary in order
to effect the intent of this Section 12.3.

12.4 [*] Contract

(a) With respect to the [*] Contract, at the Closing the Parties will enter
into an alternative, lawful arrangement under which Purchaser (or one or more
designated Subsidiaries of Purchaser) will have the right to procure
[*] services under the [*] Contract after the Closing Date, which arrangement
will be terminable by Purchaser upon [*] prior written notice to LSI. Such
arrangement will include the following terms and will otherwise be reasonably
satisfactory to LSI and Purchaser: (i) Purchaser will pay the contractual per
hour charge and performance incentive payments for such [*] services payable
pursuant to the [*] Contract; (ii) Purchaser will be entitled to receive any
[*] received by LSI or its Subsidiaries pursuant to the [*] Contract; and
(iii) LSI will pay any [*] charges payable pursuant to the [*] Contract.

(b) During the effectiveness of the arrangements described in clause (a)
above, and subject to the provisions of Section 12.4(a), Purchaser will, at
its own expense, act as the agent of LSI (or its Subsidiary) in
submitting forecasts and orders to [*] Inc. Each of LSI and Purchaser will,
and will cause its respective Subsidiaries to, take such actions, in
connection with the [*] Contract, as are reasonably necessary so that LSI and
its Subsidiaries will remain at all times in compliance in all material
respects with their obligations under the [*] Contract (other than any [*] or
contract cancellation provisions or obligations relating to the assignment of
such Contract to Purchaser). LSI will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
not to, amend the [*] Contract or waive any material right thereunder without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, which will not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

12.5 Release. Purchaser, for itself and its agents, affiliates, successors,
and assigns, hereby releases and forever discharges Sellers and their agents,
affiliates, successors, and assigns from any and all rights, claims, and
demands at law or in equity for damages, contribution, indemnity, or cost
recovery, whether known or unknown on the Signing Date or the Closing Date,
which Purchaser has or may have in the future arising out of the
environmental condition of the Gresham Facilities Real Property (or any event
occurring or circumstance existing with respect thereto) on or before August
6, 1995, including any claim for indemnification or contribution arising
under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
(42 U.S.C. Section 9601, et. seq.) or any other Environmental Law, but
excluding any claims arising out of any breach by LSI of this Agreement, any
claims for indemnification pursuant to Section 11 of this Agreement, or any
claims for common law intentional fraud by Sellers. The foregoing release will
not apply to any statutory right under any law, including any Environmental
Law, to investigate any Environmental Liability or potential Environmental
Liability if Purchaser, acting in good faith, believes that such Environmental
Liability or potential Environmental Liability may be, in whole or in part,
a Retained Liability or neither a Retained Liability nor Purchasers
Liability, and provided further that such release does not limit or preclude
Purchasers rights or ability to obtain from Sellers and their agents,
affiliates, successors, and assigns information, data, documents, or
testimony through litigation or arbitration, whether directly or by third-
party process, or to take any other actions as may be necessary or appropriate
for Purchaser to evaluate, develop, respond to, or defend any claims or  



 

44  potential claims of any sort related to the Gresham Facilities Real
Property, whether or not such claims arise from the environmental or other
condition of the Gresham Facilities Real Property before, on, or after August
6, 1995. The foregoing release does not apply to any rights, claims, or
demands at law to the extent arising out of the environmental condition of, or
out of activities at or management or operation of, real property adjoining
the Gresham Facilities Real Property on or after the date of LSIs or any of
its Subsidiaries acquisition of such adjoining real property. For the
foregoing purposes (but without in any way expanding the scope of the
foregoing release), Purchaser hereby specifically waives the provisions of
Section 1542 of the California Civil Code and any similar law of any other
state, territory or jurisdiction (if and to the extent that they would
otherwise be applicable to the release set forth in this paragraph). Section
1542 provides:

A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know
or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which
if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.

Purchaser hereby specifically acknowledges that it has carefully reviewed this
subsection and discussed its import with legal counsel and that
the provisions of this subsection are a material part of this Agreement.

Products under this Agreement and the agreed-upon lead times, acceptable
yields and defect densities, and other applicable quality and functional
requirements and specifications will be deemed to be Specifications under this
Agreement. SCI is not required to perform process development work for new
technology platforms. The addition of products using processes not being run
at the Gresham Facilities as of the Effective Date is subject to mutual
agreement. Any process development costs for such additional products will be
discussed in good faith between the Parties.

2.2 Wafer Sort Test Services. SCI will perform Wafer sort test services on
all applicable Products produced for LSI or its Subsidiaries at the Gresham
Facilities and on Products manufactured by a third party for LSI or its
Subsidiaries and delivered by LSI or any of its Subsidiaries to SCI for
processing by SCI. LSI will provide all necessary test programs to SCI in
order to provide the Wafer sort test services.

2.3 Testing by LSI. SCI will allow LSIs test engineers access to and use of
the test equipment at the Gresham Facilities during the day shift normal
working hours, and such other days and/or times as LSI may reasonably request,
under mutually agreeable arrangements and will provide test operator support
for LSIs test engineers. The hourly rate for engineering test time will be
the same as the rate for production testing. The Parties will establish a
mutually agreeable schedule by which LSIs test engineers will have access to
and use of such test equipment, updated monthly. If LSI requires additional
test time that is not reflected in the applicable schedule, than LSI (in
cooperation with SCI) will set priorities between delivery of Products and
test time. If unscheduled test time impacts On-time Delivery, then any
impacted delivery dates will be appropriately reset so that SCI will not be
penalized for failing to deliver in accordance with the original delivery
dates.



 

5 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

2.4 In-Process Wafers. SCI will finish processing all Products that are in
the process of being fabricated at the Gresham Facilities as of the Effective
Date ("In-Process Wafers") in accordance with LSIs schedule and requirements
for such Products. All In-Process Wafers will remain LSIs property at all
times while at the Gresham Facilities.

2.5 Metallization Processing. LSI will cause its supplier of RapidChip®
Slices to deliver quantities thereof to SCI at the Gresham Facilities. SCI
will accept deliveries of such RapidChip® Slices and hold them in safekeeping
as consigned materials until Metallization Processing is ordered by
LSI. Thereupon SCI will perform the Metallization Processing and other
Services requested by LSI for RapidChip Products® in accordance with the
applicable LSI specifications. In the event it is determined after SCI has
commenced Metallization Processing of a Slice that such Slice was defective
when received by SCI and SCI has properly performed the Metallization
Processing and other Services ordered by LSI for such Slice, SCI shall be
entitled to payment for the Metallization Processing and other Services
performed by SCI.

2.6 Supported Technologies. At a minimum under this Agreement SCI will support
and manufacture Products for LSI using the following technologies:

(a) _Process Technologies._ Subject to Section 14.2 below, for the Initial
Term SCI will support the C9, G10, G11, G12, CMOS35, CMOS25, and CMOS18
process technologies and the Gflx Process Technology at the Gresham
Facilities. In the event the full qualification of the Gflx Process
Technology has not occurred as of the Effective Date, SCI will support the
completion of such qualification in accordance with the requirements of LSIs
qualification plan. A summary of LSIs Gflx qualification plan requirements is
set forth as _Attachment J_ hereto.

(b) _Rapid Chip Manufacturing._ Subject to Section 14.2 below, for the term of
this Agreement SCI will support manufacture at the Gresham Facilities of
RapidChip® Products using both the G12 process technology and the Gflx
Process Technology, which includes the following obligations: pre-fabrication
of the RapidChip® Slices and storage of RapidChip® Slices in inventory for
further processing at a later date, storage of RapidChip® Slices fabricated
using the Gflx Process Technology by a third party designated by LSI for
subsequent Metallization Processing at the Gresham Facilities, and
Metallization Processing of the RapidChip® Slices manufactured at the Gresham
Facilities or by a such third party pursuant to expedited cycle times and fees
as requested by LSI and agreed to by SCI.

(c) _LVR._ When requested by LSI, SCI will use low volume Reticles (LVR) for
Wafer processing. Additionally:

(i) _Non-RapidChip Products:_ Once a particular Product has an actual history
volume totaling [*] for G12 and [*] for Gflx and a forecast of consistent
reasonable ongoing volumes for the particular Product, then LSI shall provide
a full volume Reticle set. The number of LVRs shall be limited to no more than
the average for the [*] prior to the Effective Date.



 

6 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

(ii) _RapidChip Products:_ Both SCI and LSI recognize that RapidChip Products
will require support of LVR Reticles for Wafer processing. SCI will continue
to use LVR Reticles for such RapidChip Products until such time that LSI
anticipates there will be consistent and adequate future volumes for any such
RapidChip Product, at which time an HVR set will be purchased by LSI.
_Attachment B-1_ has separate pricing for HVR (when used instead of LVR).

(d) _ITAR Flow Procedures._ Subject to Section 14.2 below, for the term of
this Agreement SCI, at its cost, will support the ITAR process flow
requirements and support LSIs military and aeronautical business (i.e., the
manufacture of integrated circuits for military and aeronautical applications)
at the Gresham Facilities.

(e) _Experimental Requests._ For the term of this Agreement, SCI will support
LSIs requirements for skew lots, DOE and other engineering-related
experimental requests by LSI. SCI will support special skews requested
by LSI, including combined poly and implant for mixed signal and for opposite
process corner comparison (e.g. strong N- /weak-P). The additional cycle time
required for processing any such experimental requests shall be incrementally
added to the committed cycle times as defined in _Attachment C_.

(f) _New Designs._ For the term of this Agreement, SCI will accept from LSI
and its Subsidiaries Orders for Products based on new designs for prototype
production and volume production to be manufactured using any of the process
technologies available at the Gresham Facilities. As new Products are included
in LSIs Requirements, the pricing for such Products will be based on the
pricing for other Products manufactured using the applicable process
technology set forth in _Attachment B_ at the time Orders for such Products
are placed. LSI may transfer Products, and the associated Reticles for such
Products, from the third partys facility in Japan referred to in Section 2.1
above as new designs for manufacturing at the Gresham Facilities. _Attachment
E_ sets forth the applicable micro-capacity for Products using such
transferred Reticles.

2.7 Second Source. If at any point during the Revenue Commitment Period LSI
believes it needs a second source for any Products, LSI will notify SCI of
such need and the Parties will discuss the matter in good faith.

2.8 Direct Relationship with Customer. LSI has relationships with certain ARO
customers (including certain process flows and the [*]). SCI agrees to
continue to support such relationships either by providing the Products and
Services to LSI under this Agreement (in which case LSI will continue to have
the direct customer relationship with the ARO customers) or until, as soon as
reasonably practicable and subject to the agreement of each ARO customer, SCI
takes direct customer responsibility for such customers.

3\. PURCHASE REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Minimum. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
provided that SCI fulfills all of its material obligations under
this Agreement (including



 

7 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

its material obligations under Sections 2, 4, 7, and 8), LSI will ensure that
it and its Subsidiaries collectively make a minimum amount of one hundred
ninety-eight million, eight hundred thousand dollars ($198,800,000) of
Qualified Purchases (the "Total Minimum Purchase Amount" or "TMPA") during the
Revenue Commitment Period. At the end of the Revenue Commitment Period, the
TMPA will be deemed satisfied if LSI and its Subsidiaries have made an
aggregate amount of Qualified Purchases at least equal to the TMPA. In
addition, during the Revenue Commitment Period LSI will ensure that it and
its Subsidiaries make Qualified Purchases in amounts at least equal to the
quarterly minimums set forth in _Attachment A_ , as such minimums may be
adjusted pursuant to Section 3.2 (the "Quarterly Minimum Purchase Amount" or
"QMPA"). All Qualified Purchases placed during a given Quarter will be totaled
to determine if the applicable QMPA has been met. All Qualified Purchases made
during the Revenue Commitment Period will be totaled to determine if the TMPA
has been met. After the Revenue Commitment Period, SCI will continue to supply
LSIs Requirements for Products and Services from the Gresham Facilities in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided,
however, LSI will no longer have any obligation to make a minimum amount of
Qualified Purchases and the TPMA or QPMA will no longer apply.

3.2 Reconciliation of QMPA. At the end of each Quarter during the Revenue
Commitment Period, LSI will provide SCI with a written report stating the
actual amount of Qualified Purchases made by LSI and its Subsidiaries in that
Quarter and the QMPA for that Quarter and any difference between the amount of
Qualified Purchases in the applicable Quarter and the QMPA for that Quarter.
If the initial and final Quarters are not complete Quarters, the applicable
QMPA will be apportioned on the basis of a 13 week Quarter (e.g., if the QMPA
for the second Quarter of 2006 is [*] and there are 10 weeks remaining in the
second Quarter of 2006 when this Agreement is signed, the QMPA for the
second Quarter of 2006 will be reduced by a factor of 10/13 from [*] to [*]
and the difference [*] will become the QMPA for the first three weeks of
Q2-08).

(a) _Excess_. If the amount of LSIs and its Subsidiaries Qualified Purchases
during a given Quarter is greater than the QMPA for that Quarter, the amount
by which the Qualified Purchases exceeds the applicable QMPA, but only up to
[*] of that Quarters QMPA, will be carried over and added to the amount of
Qualified Purchases made by LSI and its Subsidiaries in the next subsequent
Quarter as if made in that Quarter and counted toward the QMPA for that
Quarter. (See the example set forth in _Attachment B-3_.)

(b) _Shortfall_. If the amount of LSIs and its Subsidiaries Qualified
Purchases during a given Quarter is less than the QMPA for that Quarter, LSI
will pay to SCI, within 30 days after the end of the Quarter, an amount equal
to the portion of the shortfall (if any) that is greater than [*] of that
Quarters QMPA, and the remainder of the shortfall (up to [*] of that
Quarters QMPA) will be added to the QPMA for the next Quarter, resulting in
the QMPA for the next Quarter being equal to the amount of the QMPA set forth
in _Attachment A_ plus the amount of the shortfall up to [*] of the previous
Quarters QMPA. (See the example set forth in _Attachment B-3.)_

(c) _Reconciliation of TMPA_. At the end of the Revenue Commitment Period or
the end of the first subsequent Quarter thereafter in the event of a
shortfall in



 

8 the last Quarter of the Revenue Commitment Period and the applicability of
Section 3.2(b) above, the Parties will perform a final reconciliation of the
sum of (i) LSIs and its Subsidiaries total amount of Qualified Purchases
during the Revenue Commitment Period and (ii) the total amount of shortfall
payments made (or, for the final Quarter, to be made) pursuant to Section
3.2(b) against the TMPA. Except with respect to the extent that LSIs
obligation to fulfill any QMPA has been adjusted, deferred or excused pursuant
to paragraph (d) below, if such sum, as may have been so adjusted, is less
than the TMPA, then the difference will be paid by LSI to SCI within 30 days
after the Parties complete such reconciliation.

(d) _Adjustments to TMPA and QMPA._ LSIs obligation to fulfill the TMPA and
any QMPA may be adjusted, deferred or excused pursuant to circumstances as
follows:

(i) In the event that during the Revenue Commitment Period, the On-Time
Delivery date is not met by SCI, but LSIs customer will still accept a later
delivery of the finished version of such Product, LSI, at its sole discretion,
may reduce the QMPA for the Quarter in which the Product was to be delivered
and increase the QMPA for the Quarter during the Revenue Commitment Period in
which the Product is delivered to LSI by the applicable amount. In the event
delivery to LSIs customer is delayed beyond the end of the Revenue Commitment
Period, the reconciliation of the TMPA and applicable QMPA will include a
reduction to such extent.

(ii) In the event that during the Revenue Commitment Period SCI would be more
than two weeks late in making an On-Time Delivery ("Late Delivery" solely for
purposes of this paragraph (d)) of any Product and the order for the finished
version of such Product from LSIs customer has been cancelled, the QMPA will
be reduced by the Late Delivery portion of LSIs Order and LSI will use
commercially reasonable efforts to place other Orders for an equivalent amount
within the Revenue Commitment Period or within two (2) years thereafter. In
the event LSI has not placed an order for such equivalent amount before the
end of the Revenue Commitment Period, the reconciliation of the TMPA and
applicable QMPA will include a reduction to such extent.

(iii) In the event that LSI returns any Product to SCI due to the non-
conformity of the Product for which LSI is entitled to a credit or a refund
and LSIs customer for the finished version of such Product will accept a
replacement finished version of such Product, the purchase price for such
replacement Product will not be counted towards the QMPA or TMPA.

(iv) In the event that LSI returns any Product to SCI due to the non-
conformity of the Product for which LSI receives a credit or a refund and
LSIs customer for the finished version of such Product will not accept a
replacement finished version of such Product, LSI will make commercially
reasonable efforts to place other Orders for an equivalent amount of such
credit or refund within the Revenue Commitment Period or within two (2)
years thereafter. LSIs fulfillment of the applicable QMPA when such non-
conforming Product was shipped will not be affected in any manner.

4\. FORECASTS AND ORDERING 

4.1 Forecasts. Beginning on the Effective Date and continuing thereafter on a
monthly basis, LSI will provide SCI with a [*] rolling forecast by Wafer
starts of LSIs Requirements by process technology for such period (the
"Forecast").

(a) The Forecast will be provided by Wednesday in the fourth week of every
LSI fiscal month. Subject to LSIs rights to make certain adjustments the [*]
of the Forecast will be fixed ("Binding Forecast"). During (i) the [*] of the
Forecast LSI shall have the right to adjust the Binding Forecast amounts
upwards or downwards by up to [*] of the total number of Wafer starts stated
in the Binding Forecast for such [*]; (ii) the [*] of the Binding Forecast LSI
shall have the right to adjust the Binding Forecast amounts upwards or
downwards by up to [*] of the total number of Wafer starts stated in the
Binding Forecast for such [*]; and (iii) the [*] of the Binding Forecast LSI
shall have the right to adjust the Binding Forecast amounts upwards or
downwards by up to [*] of the total number of Wafer starts stated in the
Binding Forecast for such [*]; provided, however, LSI may not make any
increases in the Forecast amounts that would exceed the micro-capacity
constraints identified in _Attachment E_ or the availability of resources and
raw materials necessary to manufacture the Products and perform the Services.

(b) The [*] of the Forecast will not be binding on LSI, will be subject to
adjustment at LSIs discretion, and will identify monthly demand for LSIs
Requirements for planning purposes only. Once per Quarter the Parties will
review the forecasted capacity loadings, and the availability of resources and
raw materials to determine what, if any, additional capacity is available in
excess of any previous Forecast amount.

(c) In no event does the exercise by LSI of its right to make any of the
adjustments provided by (a) or (b) above to the Forecast relieve LSI from its
obligations to meet the TMPA and applicable QMPA.

4.2 Process Technology Mix. In addition to LSIs right to increase or
decrease the amounts of the Binding Forecast as described in Section 4.1, if
LSI requests changes to the process technology mix (i.e., the quantity of
Products to be manufactured using each distinct process technology) within
the Binding Forecast period, SCI will make reasonable efforts to accommodate
the requested changes, taking into consideration available capacity for the
relevant process technology and availability of materials. __ Unless SCI
agrees otherwise, the mix of process technologies used to meet LSIs
Requirements set forth in the Forecasts will fall within minimum and maximum
weekly start rates for each process technology to be agreed upon by the
Parties during the forecasting process for Products, and in any event will not
exceed the individual micro-capacities of the process technologies referred to
in Section 4.4.

4.3 Product Mix. _Attachment A_ , which sets forth LSIs initial estimates
made as of the Effective Date regarding the mix of Products and Services to
be ordered by LSI during the Revenue Commitment Period also reflects the
Parties minimum assumptions regarding Wafer capacity for LSIs Requirements
and the fulfillment of the applicable QMPA and TMPA by LSI. It
is acknowledged that in order for LSI to fulfill



 

10 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

its QMPA and TMPA, additional Product run rates will be required, which will
be ascertained pursuant to the Forecasts provided by LSI under Section 4.1.
The estimates set out in _Attachment A_ are not binding on LSI with respect to
any subsequent Forecast or Order for the production of specific Products or
Services. LSI has the right to make changes to this estimated mix of Products
and Services when it places Orders, provided, however, LSI will remain
obligated to fulfill the TMPA and applicable QMPA.

4.4 Capacity. During the Revenue Commitment Period, SCI will ensure that
sufficient capacity at the Gresham Facilities is reserved and available at
all times to meet LSIs Requirements. After the Revenue Commitment Period, the
Parties will meet on a Quarterly basis to determine the maximum capacity of
the Gresham Facilities that will be allocated to LSI; _provided, however,_
that SCI will make commercially reasonable efforts to allocate (taking into
account SCIs other capacity needs at that time on a _pari passu_ basis)
maximum capacity to LSI that is at least [*] of the average weekly Wafer start
capacity actually used by LSI for the Quarter having the highest number of
Orders for Wafer starts submitted by LSI out of the previous [*]. (See the
example set forth in _Attachment B-3_.) The process technologies and related
mix thereof set forth in an Order will take into consideration, and not
exceed, the capacity allocated to LSI as so agreed to by both Parties from
time to time, as well as individual micro-capacities of the process
technologies and all other capacity limitations agreed to by the Parties in
writing. _Attachment E_ sets forth the process technology micro-capacities at
the Gresham Facilities as of the Effective Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will limit LSIs right to submit Orders
for Products that have been discontinued pursuant to Section 14.2. If LSI
requests capacity increases that would require additional capital expenditures
by SCI, then the Parties will discuss in good faith options for putting
in place the additional capacity (e.g., LSI may consign equipment to SCI or
if LSI purchases the equipment, then SCI will rebate the depreciation expense
(using LSIs applicable useful life) through a reduction to the applicable
Wafer or Die price as set forth in _Attachment B-1_ ). In the event
additional employees would be required to support production of additional LSI
demand, SCI will exercise its reasonable best efforts to hire and employ such
additional employees to support the increased demand.

4.5 Minimum Supply of Raw Materials. SCI will maintain adequate inventories of
raw materials in order to fulfill the volumes as set forth in the Binding
Forecasts provided by LSI. SCI will have the right to invoice LSI for SCIs
actual purchase cost for any raw substrates that are unique to LSIs
specifications purchased by SCI against the Binding Forecasts, which are not
required to meet LSIs actual Orders and are not used within [*] of delivery
of the substrates to SCI. The foregoing states LSIs entire obligation and
SCIs entire remedy with respect to excess raw materials purchased by SCI if
LSI fails to place Orders for Products or Services sufficient to meet the
Binding Forecast. If conditions occur that will require SCI to enter into long
term take or pay type arrangements with suppliers to secure the supply of raw
materials, then the Parties will discuss and resolve in good faith the
allocation of obligations and risk under such arrangements.

4.6 Purchase Orders. LSI will submit to SCI weekly purchase order releases
containing Die demand or Wafer demand instructions that identify the Products,
the



 

11 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

quantity of Products and the applicable process technologies for such Products
that are to be shipped to LSI, showing the required shipment date, the
address for delivery of the completed Products, and any other information
applicable to the Products (each such release, an "Order"). All Orders meeting
the requirements of Sections 4.2 and 4.3 and consistent with the Binding
Forecast and agreed upon cycle times shall be accepted by SCI and confirmed to
LSI within [*]. For all Products involving RapidChip® Slices to be delivered
to the Gresham Facilities, SCI cannot commit to a delivery date unless such
RapidChip® Slices are on-hand or a projected delivery date for the requisite
RapidChip® Slices to the Gresham Facility has been provided. The On-Time
Delivery date for any such Product will be reset to the extent the RapidChip®
Slices are received later than the projected delivery date to the Gresham
Facility. All other Orders will be deemed accepted by SCI unless LSI receives
a written notice of rejection (stating the reason or reasons for such
rejection) within [*] after LSI submitted the Order to SCI. LSIs Subsidiaries
will have the right to submit Orders under this Agreement and all such Orders
will be counted as if placed by LSI for the purposes of the
Qualified Purchases, Binding Forecasts, Forecasts, and all other purchase
requirements of LSI. LSI represents that it has the authority to cause its
Subsidiaries to place Orders with SCI under this Agreement and to comply with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement when placing Orders with SCI, and
LSI will cause its Subsidiaries to comply with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement when placing Orders with SCI. LSI will order Products in [*]
Wafer lot sizes. Die scheduling will be lot sized by LSI prior to placing
Orders.

(a) Changes. LSI may, from time to time after submission of an Order, provide
written notice to SCI proposing changes to the applicable Order (a "Change
Proposal"). Following delivery and receipt of the Change Proposal, the Parties
will promptly discuss appropriate modifications to the applicable Order
(including any changes in the delivery or production schedule or to the
pricing for the Products and Services that are the subject of the Change
Proposal). If the Change Proposal postpones delivery of Products or Services
identified in the Order and SCI has not begun of the manufacture of the
applicable Products or performance of the Services, such Change Proposal will
be deemed accepted by the Parties and SCI will implement the Change Proposal.
If the Change Proposal postpones delivery of Products or Services identified
in the Order and SCI has begun manufacture of the applicable Products or
performance of the Services, such Change Proposal will be deemed accepted by
the Parties and SCI will continue manufacture of the Products or performance
of the Services and with respect to the Products, upon completion will hold
the completed Products and completed work product with respect to the Services
in inventory until the requested delivery date. Similarly, if a Change
Proposal requests partial manufacture of a Product, so long as SCI has not
manufactured the Product past the point specified in the Change Proposal, such
Change Proposal will be deemed accepted by the Parties and SCI will complete
partial manufacture of a Product and hold the Product in inventory until
needed by LSI. If SCI is required to hold any Products such hold will not
exceed [*] or available storage capacity limitations. After [*], SCI will
request instructions from LSI (i) to complete production of such Products and
ship them as finished Products, (ii) to ship such Products to LSI in their
partially processed condition or (iii) to cancel further production of such
Products. SCI shall perform in accordance with LSIs instructions
and thereafter invoice LSI for the appropriate Wafer price or the charge for
partial processing or cancellation as appropriate in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.



 

12 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

(b) Cancellation. LSI may cancel any Order or a portion thereof without
charge, to the extent that the portion being cancelled has not been started.
LSI may cancel any Order or portion thereof that has been started, but will be
required to pay a cancellation charge to SCI reflecting the percentage
of manufacturing completion (see _Attachment B-2_ ) of the Products being
cancelled multiplied by the applicable price. Any such cancellation charges
during the [*] of this Agreement will be credited towards LSIs fulfillment of
the TMPA and applicable QMPA when such cancellation charges occur.

4.7 No Adjustment for Defective Products. If LSI cancels all or any part
of an Order or returns any Products as permitted under Section 6.1, Section
11.2(c), or Section 15.9, the amount of such cancelled Order or returned
Products will be counted toward LSIs fulfillment of the TMPA, the applicable
QMPA, and the applicable Binding Forecast.

5\. PRICING; PAYMENT; AND DELIVERY

5.1 Product Pricing. _Attachment B-1_ to this Agreement sets forth the prices
for the Wafers based on the applicable process technologies used to
manufacture the Product and the prices for the process adders for optional
processing steps. The date applicable to such pricing shall be based on the
LSI requested delivery date or the actual delivery date, whichever is later.
In addition: 

(a) For Products for which [*] Wafers within the prior [*] of an Order being
placed have been manufactured on a stable process platform, statistical post
processing ("SPP") algorithm (if applicable), and sort test program, Die based
pricing will be used. An initial list of Products is set forth in _Attachment
B-6_. Such Die based pricing will be determined using the sort yield, or post
SPP yields if applicable, for such Product of the most [*] prior to when the
Product is to be manufactured as applied to the applicable Wafer pricing for
such Product set forth in _Attachment B-1_. The applicable Die or Wafer
pricing to which such post SPP yield data is applied will be pricing
applicable to the Quarter in which delivery of the Product to LSI is made. The
NDPW used for Die based pricing will be based on section 5.2 below. For
Products with [*] Wafers produced, Wafer based pricing will be used until
such time that [*] Wafers will have been produced, and thereafter subsequent
Orders will be based on Die based pricing. These prices apply to all of LSIs
purchases of the applicable Products made during the Revenue Commitment
Period. After the Revenue Commitment Period, the Parties will meet on a
quarterly basis to review the pricing and to negotiate in good faith, as the
case may be, price decreases, as are justified by reference to external Wafer
pricing market data (e.g. Selantek), or price increases, as are justified
based on unforeseen and substantial cost increases then being generally
experienced by semiconductor manufacturers to the extent such cost increases
are also reflected in such external market data.

(b) For Products for which LSI requires bumping, Wafer prices as set forth in
_Attachment B-1_ will be used for such Products; provided, however, for bumped
Wafer Products for which [*] Wafers have been manufactured, if the actual Die
yields for



 

13 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

such Products, (after bump and sort yield or SPP as applicable) is lower than
the expected NDPW due to a Wafer processing cause, LSI shall be entitled to a
credit for the shortfall in the actual NDPW as compared to the expected NDPW.
Similarly, for bumped Wafer Products for which [*] wafers have been
manufactured, if the actual Die yields for such Products (after bump and sort
yield or SPP as applicable) is higher than the expected NDPW, SCI shall be
entitled to invoice LSI for the excess in the actual NDPW as compared to the
expected NDPW.

(c) If the actual number of Die manufactured (for Die Orders) or Wafers
manufactured (for Wafer Orders) is greater than the actual quantity
LSI ordered, SCI will only ship to LSI the number of Products equal to the
nearest half or full lot size ordered by rounding up.

(d) If the actual number of Die manufactured (for Die Orders) or Wafers
manufactured (for Wafers Orders) is less than the actual quantity LSI ordered,
SCI shall promptly notify LSI of such fact. LSI, at its sole discretion, may
cancel such Order to the extent of such quantity that would not be delivered
in a timely manner and in the event that LSIs cancellation made pursuant to
Section 11.2, the Wafer price amount(s) applicable to such cancelled Order
quantity will be deemed to be Qualified Purchases. In the event LSI still
desires delivery of the full quantity per the Order to be made, SCI will
promptly start the appropriate quantity of Wafers for delivery of such Die or
Wafer shortfall and expedite the production and delivery of such Wafers to
LSI without additional charges.

5.2 Calculation of Product Pricing

(a) _Setting NDPW_. Prices for the Products are based on the actual number of
Wafers that satisfy post SPP yield to be agreed upon by the Parties. When [*]
Wafers of a Product that satisfy such agreed-upon post SPP yield and have been
produced at the Gresham Facilities (including Wafers produced prior to the
Effective Date), a "Net Die per Wafer" or "NDPW" yield factor will be
established by the Parties based on the average post SPP yield of the
applicable Product for the [*] preceding the date the NDPW yield factor is
being established. The NDPW yield factor for those Products that as of the
Effective Date have had [*] Wafers produced at the Gresham Facilities is set
forth in _Attachment B_. When the [*] Wafers of additional Products have been
manufactured, NDPW yield factor for such additional Products will be
established and agreed upon by the Parties; _Attachment B_ will be updated
accordingly.

(b) _Price per Good Die_. When the NDPW yield factor is established for a
Product, the price for each good Die will be determined based upon a formula.
The Parties will review and recalculate the NDPW yield factors and the good
Die prices for each applicable Product once per Quarter. The following
Products, [*], [*] and [*], including any revisions thereof, are an [*].
These Products will be priced based on the post SPP NDPW as of the Effective
Date. Once these [*] are complete and LSIs [*] therefor has [*] for these
Products, the NDPW will be immediately adjusted based on the [*] Wafers and
the Die pricing will be adjusted accordingly. LSI will [*] of the new Die
price on these Products. The Parties will review and recalculate the NDPW
yield factor and the Die price for all other Products once per quarter. If
the NDPW yield factor for a



 

14 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

Product increases as a result of any such quarterly review, a revised price
per good Die will promptly be determined for such Product based upon such
formula and applied as the new price for all applicable Wafer starts made
thereafter. If the increase in the NDPW yield factor at any such review is
[*], the revised price per good Die will be calculated so that [*] of the
price decrease is shared with SCI (i.e., the price per good Die paid by LSI
will be decreased by [*] of the amount it would have decreased based on upon
the pricing formula). NDPW yield factor decreases will not result in a price
reduction. (See the example set forth in _Attachment B-3._ )

(c) _Changes in Sort Test Programs or SPP Algorithms._ Pricing will be
adjusted as follows: (i) if LSI makes changes to the sort test program or SPP
algorithm for test coverage that results in a reduction in NDPW unrelated to
existing manufacturing or process methodologies, the Die pricing will be
adjusted accordingly, (ii) if LSI makes changes to the sort test program or
SPP algorithm due to customer requirements that result in a reduction in NDPW
that is unrelated to existing manufacturing or process methodologies, the Die
pricing will be adjusted accordingly, or (iii) if LSI makes changes to the
sort test program or SPP algorithm that results in NDPW as a result of changes
made to the existing process by SCI after the Effective Date or manufacturing
or workmanship issues unrelated to the process as defined on the Effective
Date, the Die pricing will not be adjusted. In all cases, SCI will work with
LSI to improve yields and take actions to return the yield back to the
original NDPW.

(d) _Changes in Test Times._ If LSI makes any change in a test program that
increases or decreases the test times to sort a Product, the applicable Die
price will be adjusted upwards or downwards on all Products to which such
changed test time is applied.

(e) _Low Volume Production._ Once volume for any given technology (e.g., C9,
G10, G11, G12 or Gflx) drops below [*] Wafers per [*], all Products running on
that technology shall revert Wafer pricing.

(f) _Die Pricing._ If at any time during this Agreement, SCI determines that
the administrative time and costs associated with maintaining Die pricing is
unduly burdensome, it will notify LSI and the Parties will negotiate a
resolution in good faith.

5.3 Wafer Sort Test Services. SCI will perform Wafer sort test services and
will provide access to LSI test engineers to the test equipment for the rate
per hour of test equipment time for such services set forth in _Attachment
B-3_. If LSI requires additional test time that is not reflected in the
schedule agreed to by the Parties, then LSI (in cooperation with SCI) will set
priorities between delivery of Products and test time. If unscheduled test
time required by LSI impacts On-time Delivery then any impacted delivery
dates will be reset so that SCI will not be penalized for failing to deliver
in accordance with the original delivery dates.

5.4 In-Process Wafer Pricing. Pricing for In-Process Wafer processing will be
based on the type of process and the degree of completion of the Wafer as of
the Effective Date. The prices for the various amounts of Wafer
processing according to each process technology for the In-Process Wafers are
set forth in _Attachments B-1_ and _B-2_.



 

15 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

5.5 Rapid Chip Product Pricing. Pricing for manufacture and processing of
RapidChip® Products will be based on the type of process and the degree of
processing of the Product that SCI will perform. The prices for the various
amounts of Wafer processing according to each process technology
for RapidChip® Products are set forth in _Attachment B-1_.

5.6 Other Fees

(a) _Expedited Processing (Hot Lots and Super Hot Lots)_. LSI will pay SCI the
fees set forth on _Attachment B-3_ for the corresponding expedited
processing. To the extent LSI is charged any amounts for expedited partial
processing of Products, such amounts will be prorated over the number of
processing moves that receive expedited treatment. Expedite fees shall not be
charged for any such lot that is not delivered by the SCI committed expedited
delivery date.

(b) _Prototypes._ LSI will be charged the pricing premium set forth on
_Attachment B-3_ for any prototype products that LSI requests SCI to
manufacture.

(c) _Small Lots._ LSI has the right to place "Small Lot" Orders on average
over the quarter for [*] of the production lots of Products with a maximum of
[*] of production lots started in any given week. For anything above these
percentages, LSI will pay a [*] premium over the standard prices paid to SCI
for such Products.

(d) A "Small Lot" is a production lot having less than [*] Wafers.

(e) _Reticles_. If LSI obtains any Reticles from SCI under this Agreement, any
fees paid by LSI for such Reticles will include all fees for engineering work
related to preparation of the Reticles and all costs of the initial mask
preparation. LSI will own all such Reticles, but SCI will retain custody of
and the responsibility for safekeeping for such Reticles during the period
they are available for use at the Gresham Facilities.

(f) _Consumables._ LSI will provide to SCI all probe cards and load boards
necessary for SCI to manufacture the Products; provided that both Parties
agree that all such probe cards and load boards will remain LSIs property and
the probe cards and load boards for Products manufactured at the Gresham
Facilities as of the Effective Date are already located at the Gresham
Facilities. LSI will be responsible for maintenance and replacement costs for
all probe cards used by SCI. Maintenance costs for probe cards will be billed
to LSI at [*]. Any other consumables used by SCI in performance of its
obligations under this Agreement will be the sole responsibility of SCI, and
LSI will not owe SCI any separate amounts for such consumables. SCI will
repair or replace any such items that are damaged, lost or otherwise rendered
unusable due to any act or omission by SCI while they are in SCIs custody or
control.



 

16 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

(g) _Engineering Maintenance Services._ Engineering time for engineering
maintenance on Retained Equipment, if requested by LSI, will be charged per
_Attachment B-3_.

(h)  _Transition Services._ Transition Services requested by LSI pursuant to
Section 14.4 will be provided by SCI at a [*]. LSI will also reimburse SCI for
any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by SCI in providing such
Transition Services, subject to LSIs prior approval of such costs.

(i) _Invoicing and Payment Terms_. SCI will submit to LSI invoices for
payment of applicable prices or fees for Products and Services after delivery
of the applicable Products to LSI or completion of the applicable Services.
LSI will pay all undisputed amounts set forth in each properly delivered
invoice [*] from the date of the invoice. LSI will promptly provide to SCI
notice of any disputed payments and the Parties will negotiate promptly and in
good faith to resolve the issue. Payments will be made by wire transfer to the
account specified in  _Attachment G_. All payments will be made in U.S.
dollars. Until LSI has received full payment of all amounts due under the
Final Installment Payment, LSI shall have and at its discretion may exercise a
right to offset any and all amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement against payment due to LSI pursuant to the Final Installment Payment
at any time after the Final Installment Payment, in whole or in part, has
become due but remains unpaid.

5.7 Taxes. The prices for the Products and Services are exclusive of sales
tax, use tax, value added tax, or other similar tax or duty imposed by any
government authority (collectively, "Taxes"). If any such Taxes are imposed in
connection with the sale or transfer of Products to LSI or any of its
Subsidiaries by SCI hereunder, LSI shall bear the cost of such Taxes provided
that the amount of such Taxes is properly invoiced to LSI along with the
price of the Products in question. The Parties will cooperate in the recovery
of any such Taxes paid and in the reduction of Taxes payable. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if LSI provides SCI with a valid resellers
tax exemption certificate for particular Products, SCI will not include any
Taxes in its invoices for such Products. In no event will LSI be liable for
any taxes based on SCIs net income or profits.

5.8 Inventory. If an Order specifies or LSI requests that SCI store completed
or in-process Products in inventory, SCI will keep such Products in an
appropriately controlled environment for such Products. SCI shall not be
required to provide any such storage in excess of the available storage
capacity existing at the Effective Date. Such storage will be at no
additional cost to LSI. SCI will retain risk of loss and title to all Products
held in inventory by SCI, except as may be otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement. SCI will invoice LSI for in-process Products held in inventory
by SCI only after SCI completes manufacture of the Products and delivers the
Products to LSI. LSI will pay such invoices as provided in Section 5.7.

5.9 Delivery. SCI will arrange shipment of the Products to the LSI or the LSI
customer facility designated in the Order on the delivery date specified in
the Order. All shipments by SCI will be made F.O.B. the Gresham Facilities.
SCI will follow LSIs standard packaging, shipping, handling, and insurance
procedures for shipment of the



 

17 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

Products. Risk of loss and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
title to the Products will pass to LSI (or its Subsidiary) upon delivery of
the Products to the common carrier at the Gresham Facilities. LSI will have
the right to cancel an Order to the extent of applicable Products that are not
shipped within the On-Time Delivery requirements; provided, however, in the
event that LSIs cancellation is made pursuant to Section 11.2, the Wafer
price amount(s) applicable to such cancelled Order quantity will be deemed to
be Qualified Purchases. In addition, SCI will promptly reimburse LSI for any
reasonable expedite charges, late charges, or similar costs or expenses
incurred by LSI as a result of SCIs failure to meet the On-Time Delivery
requirements for any Product, up to a total amount of [*] per Wafer Lot.

5.10 MRB. SCI will manage the MRB process on lots that are placed on any type
of factory hold for a process or design related reason. LSI will cooperate
with SCI for prompt resolution of the reason such lots were placed on hold.
SCI will make commercially reasonable efforts to not allow the distribution of
number of MRB lots on sort hold and the average time to resolve them to
exceed the results achieved by LSI at the Gresham Facilities for the [*]. The
distribution of MRB lots achieved by LSI at the Gresham Facilities in the [*]
shall be considered the "Baseline Distribution". To the extent that SCI
achieves or exceeds the Baseline Distribution, such MRB lots on sort hold will
not be counted in the computation of the On-Time Delivery performance. If the
distribution of number of MRB lots on sort hold and the average time are
greater than the Baseline Distribution, to the extent the distribution of the
quantity of MRB lots on sort hold exceeds the Baseline Distribution, the cycle
time that is outside of the Baseline Distribution for such MRB lots will be
counted in the computation of the On-Time Delivery performance. Any lot that
becomes an MRB lot on hold during Wafer processing (i.e. prior to sort) lot
will be counted in the DPML calculation. Lots exempt in this calculation are
any lots placed on hold by LSI, including products that are waiting for
reticles due to a design change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Wafer lot
that (i) is in WIP and is an MRB lot as of the Effective Date or (ii) becomes
an MRB lot after the Effective Date due to processing that occurred prior to
the Effective Date, will not be counted in the DPML calculation or
distribution.

6\. SCRAP LIMITS

6.1 Minimum Die Yield. If the yield or defect density of the Wafers and/or any
Wafer Lot for any Product are at or below the Minimum Die Yield (as defined
in _Attachment F_ ) for such Product, LSI will have the right to reject the
Wafers and/or the entire Wafer Lot, at no cost to LSI. The Minimum Die Yield
for each Product will be initially calculated when [*] production Wafers for
such Product have been manufactured at the Gresham Facilities (including
Wafers manufactured prior to the Effective Date) and will be recalculated
every [*] thereafter using the data from the just-ended [*] period; _provided
however,_ that no reduction in the Minimum Die Yield for a Product will be
permitted. _Attachment F_ sets forth the Minimum Die Yield for each Product
for which [*] or more production Wafers have been manufactured at the Gresham
Facilities as of the Effective Date.

6.2 Rejection of Products. If LSI or one of its Subsidiaries rejects any
Products as provided in Section 6.1, SCI will promptly give LSI a full credit
for the



 

18 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

amounts paid by LSI for such rejected Products via a credit memo for such
rejected Products, including the sort charge value for such rejected
Products. If LSIs expected payments to SCI within the [*] would not be fully
offset by the credit, at LSIs option, LSI will have the right to require a
cash refund equal to the unused amount of the credit.

6.3 Disposal of Scrap. SCI will properly dispose of all Wafers and Wafer Lots
rejected by LSI and all other scrap in compliance with all applicable laws in
order to prevent any unauthorized sale and environmental hazards; _provided,
however,_ that SCI will give LSI access as requested by LSI to any scrap
material for failure analysis or other engineering purposes.

7\. CYCLE TIME REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Cycle Times. SCI will record and report to LSI cycle times for manufacture
and supply of the Products in industry-standard days per masking layer
("DPML") by process technology. Promptly after the Effective Date, the Parties
will establish cycle times for all process technologies by referencing the
cycle times for the applicable Products obtained at the Gresham
Facilities during the [*] period ending on the Effective Date. ( _Attachment
C_ sets forth an example of cycle times.) SCI will measure DPML at the [*]
percentile level and not as an average. If for any Product the DPML falls
above the [*] percentile level for any measurement period or if during any
measurement period there is reasonable evidence to indicate the DPML will be
above the [*] percentile level when the relevant measurement for the period is
made, SCI will promptly initiate such corrective actions, in coordination
with LSI, as LSI reasonably deems appropriate.

7.2 Expedited Production. SCI will allocate to LSI up to [*] Hot Lots and [*]
Super Hot Lots in the Gresham Facilities running concurrently at any time. As
each Hot Lot or Super Hot Lot, as the case may be, is completed, the available
allocated type of Lot will be available to LSI. [*] The subsequent negotiated
amounts shall not fall below the Hot Lots or Super Hot Lot percentage of total
production as reflected in the allocation for the first half of 2006. SCI will
make commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate any additional Hot Lots
or Super Hot Lots requested by LSI from time to time. LSI will have the right,
in its discretion, to have SCI perform expedited processing for any or all of
the process steps in the production of a Wafer Lot.

7.3 Low Running Technologies. Once volumes for any given technology (e.g., C9,
C10, G11, G12 or Gflx) falls below [*] Wafers per [*], the applicable cycle
time requirement the Parties will mutually agree in good faith to a relaxed
DPML.

7.4 [*] Services. For some period of time under this Agreement, [*] services
required to complete the processing of the Products may be performed by [*].
The Parties agree that SCI will be responsible for managing the day to day
relationship with [*]. Provided SCI has properly performed such activities,
SCI will not be responsible for any failure to meet its obligations under this
Agreement to the extent resulting from the acts or omissions of [*] If an
issue occurs with [*] performance, the Parties agree to discuss in good faith
a resolution of the issue.



 

19 8\. QUALITY, REPORTING, AND INSPECTION

8.1 Quality. Finished Products and Services supplied by SCI hereunder,
including RapidChip® Products and In-Process Wafers to the extent processed
by SCI, will meet the applicable procedural, quality and functional
requirements and specifications (the "Specifications") as set forth in
_Attachment H_. At all times during this Agreement, SCI will perform in
accordance with the requirements specified below.

(a) SCI will manufacture and provide Products to LSI according to the
reliability, manufacture, and performance specifications (including
monitoring requirements) of LSI.

(b) SCI will comply with the fab related portions of LSIs corporate quality
requirements and procedures as documented by LSI in the following
documentation: WG36-000001-00 (Gresham Factory Reliability Requirements
Document) and QA00-000004-21 (General Spec for Supplier Quality
and Reliability Requirements Guidelines). These requirements and procedures
are set forth in _Attachment H_.

(c) SCI will perform quality inspection on the Products, including Wafer
acceptance testing ("WAT"), parametric testing, or E-Test, according to LSIs
specifications, which may include customer-specific enhancements and/or
modifications to LSIs standard specifications.

(d) SCI will maintain the level of quality in production and materials
(including gas or chemical) necessary to, at a minimum, satisfy the defect
densities and/or quality levels required by LSI or its customers.

(e) SCI will cooperate with LSI to continuously improve all quality metrics
and results relating to the supply of Products and Services as LSI and/or
LSIs customers may request.

SCI will be solely responsible for all costs it incurs in meeting the
specifications and requirements in this Section 8.1. If SCI desires to make
any changes to any of the foregoing requirements or specifications or other
changes to the manufacturing process, SCI will follow LSIs Engineering Change
Notification protocols. A copy of the Engineering Change Notification
Protocols are set forth in _Attachment I_.

8.2 Documentation. Within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, in
addition to the Specifications, LSI will document the following processes and
specifications:

(a) The specifications and special lead times for the ITAR flow, including the
protocols required for the ITAR flow and the Products that will follow the
ITAR flow;

(b) The RapidChip® Product protocols, process flows, devices, and special
specifications;



 

20 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

(c) The ARO process flows by customer, including the Products and special
handling requirements for each customer; and

(d) The work remaining to do with the [*], the resources required, and
the cost and the timeline of the [*].

8.3 Reporting. SCI will maintain adequate records and adequate systems to
generate all reports and track all data required by LSI. In addition, at a
minimum, SCI will give LSI direct systems access to the following data
relating to the Products ordered by LSI:

(a) process yield data (fab line yield);

(b) real time access to the work in process ("WIP") (WIP status by stage,
location, quantities, lot number part number and ship dates), substantially
similar to what Gresham provides as of the Effective Date;

(c) statistical data (data result type from all tester types of sort, yield
maps e-test data and metrology data);

(d) process records (for Lots manufactured for LSI), including in-line
inspection data, process travelers and any data, including traceability data,
related to the process used for manufacture of LSIs Products; and

(e) any and all data and reporting statistics required by LSIs customers on
LSI Products. LSI agrees to make all commercially reasonable efforts to work
with its customers to limit the scope of such requests to those reasonably
obtainable.

The Parties agree that such direct systems access for LSI data will be
replaced by "My Fab View" (including number of masking steps left for a
particular lot to completion of Wafer processing) and direct access for
Product engineering information will continue to be provided through the YDS
system.

8.4 Testing by LSI. When LSI receives Products to sort at a location other
than the Gresham Facilities, LSI will test the Products according to the
applicable Specifications. LSI will provide SCI with LSIs testing
information derived from testing such Products, including the number of good
Die, the yield and the defect density for such Products. LSI will report such
testing information to SCI [*] after conclusion of LSIs testing. If LSIs
test results reveal defects that cause LSI to reject any Products, LSI and
SCI will cooperate to determine the reason for the defects and resolve the
defects in any future Products. LSI has the right to place, access (both
directly and remotely), and use a subcontractor technical network server on
the test floor of the Gresham Facilities to transfer tester programs and data
from testers from SCIs systems to LSIs or LSIs designated subcontractors
off-site locations. In connection with this server, LSI will have the right
to set up and maintain, at LSIs expense, a communications link to LSIs off-
site locations from the test floor for uploading Wafer sort yield data on the
Products that are tested at the Gresham Facilities.



 

21 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

8.5 Process Change Control. SCI will comply with LSIs current procedures for
changes to any technology or manufacturing processes under this Agreement. As
of the Effective Date, such process change control procedures are set forth in
the following specifications: VB00-000315-00 (QRB Operations Spec
for Supplier PCN and Change Control) and VB00-000075-00 (QRB Operating
Procedure). SCI will notify LSI in writing in advance of all changes to
technology or manufacturing processes. In the event LSI makes any changes to
such procedures, LSI will provide SCI with reasonable prior written notice.

8.6 Wafer Sort Test Program Revision Control. SCI will use LSIs Wafer
sort programs, processes, and procedures for the Products and SCI will have
no right to make any changes to such Wafer sort programs, processes, and
procedures without the prior written consent of LSI. LSI will update such
programs as and when necessary and will promptly provide all such updated
programs to SCI. Prior to the commencement of any Wafer sort test services,
SCI will verify that it is using the most recent version of the applicable
test program. Changes that do not change the sort yield or SPP (if
applicable) or the test times, will not require approval from SCI. For all
other test program changes, the Parties will define a control process for
releasing changes to production.

8.7 Audit and Inspection. Upon reasonable prior written notice from LSI, SCI
will allow LSI, its representatives, and/or LSIs customers reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Gresham Facilities to audit and inspect
the Gresham Facilities (including the equipment), to confirm compliance by SCI
with the terms of this Agreement, LSIs quality requirements, and LSIs
customers quality requirements. In addition, SCI will allow LSI and LSIs
customers reasonable access to the Gresham Facilities to address any
performance issues. If LSI or its customer finds a deficiency with the
Gresham Facilities or noncompliance with the terms of this Agreement, LSI
will provide written notice to SCI of the deficiency or noncompliance and SCI
will cure such deficiency or noncompliance within a reasonable period.

8.8 On-Site LSI Staffing. SCI will permit and facilitate the presence of up to
[*] LSI employees reasonably acceptable to SCI at the Gresham Facilities to
monitor the performance of the manufacturing operations with respect to the
Products and Services. Such LSI employees will be given access to any portion
of the Gresham Facilities, including the fab areas, as such LSI employees
deem appropriate; provided, however, such person(s) would be required to
comply with SCIs security, confidentiality and safety procedures. SCI will
provide such security and safety procedures to LSI in writing promptly after
the Effective Date and will communicate such procedures to the applicable
personnel as appropriate. Such persons are invited to attend, and allowed to
participate in, as appropriate, SCIs operations reviews and meetings when
Product and Service issues are addressed. During the twelve (12) month period
immediately following the Effective Date, SCI will provide adequate separate
"visitor" office space and communications facilities for such LSI persons.
Thereafter, the Parties will review the desirability for continuation of
access to such office space and communications facilities.

9. CONFIDENTIALITY. Any disclosure of any confidential information of either
Party pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement will be governed by the
terms of the Nondisclosure Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time
(the "Master



 

22 NDA"). LSIs Confidential Information protected under the Master NDA includes
the Licensed Material, Specifications, process technologies used to
manufacture the Products, LSIs quality and testing requirements, all failure
analysis information and all pricing information specified in this Agreement.

10\. OWNERSHIP

10.1 License to Licensed Material. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, LSI hereby grants to SCI, for the term of this Agreement as
set forth in Section 14.1, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
non-transferable (except as part of an assignment of this Agreement under
Section 15.1), limited, revocable license, under all of LSIs applicable
Proprietary Rights, to use the Licensed Material solely at the Gresham
Facilities and solely as necessary to manufacture the Products for LSI and
its Subsidiaries and perform the Services for LSI and its Subsidiaries, in
accordance with this Agreement. LSI retains all right, title, and interest in
and ownership of all Licensed Material and no other licenses or rights to any
Licensed Material or any other Proprietary Rights of LSI, implied or
otherwise, are granted to SCI under this Agreement. SCI is solely responsible
for all costs and damages to any Licensed Material that occur while such
Licensed Material is in SCIs possession or control. If at any time during
this Agreement LSI no longer has the right to license any of the Licensed
Material to SCI, LSI will promptly notify SCI and SCIs license as to such
Licensed Material will promptly cease. Thereafter the Parties will promptly
discuss and determine any adjustments that need to be made to this Agreement,
including each Partys obligations hereunder, based on the removal of such
item of Licensed Material; provided, however, in no event shall SCI be
required to thereby incur any new obligation (financial or otherwise) that is
materially greater than SCIs existing obligations hereunder. Promptly after
the Effective Date, LSI will deliver to SCI all Licensed Material not already
located at the Gresham Facilities or otherwise in SCIs possession.

10.2 In-Process Wafers. LSI retains all right, title, and interest in and
ownership of all In-Process Wafers. In-Process Wafers will be held by SCI on a
consignment basis for completion of the applicable Wafer processing by SCI
following the Effective Date. SCI will bear the risk of loss of the In-
Process Wafers as of the Effective Date until the In-Process Wafers are
delivered to LSI as provided in Section 5.9 above.

10.3 RapidChip Products

(a) _RapidChip Slices not manufactured by SCI._ LSI retains all right, title,
and interest in and ownership of all RapidChip® Slices stored at the Gresham
Facilities by SCI and all Products partially processed by a third party and

RapidChip® Slices manufactured by SCI and held for future completion of
the applicable processing by SCI. SCI will bear the risk of loss of all such
RapidChip® Slices and partially processed Products until delivery of such
Products to LSI as provided in Section 5.9 above.

10.4 Reticles. LSI has, will have, and will retain all right, title, and
interest in all Reticles. SCI will safeguard and maintain secure custody of
the Reticles until LSI requests return of the Reticles or delivery of the
Reticles to a third party, at which time SCI will deliver the Reticles at
LSIs cost and risk as instructed by LSI. While the Reticles are in SCIs
possession or control, SCI will bear the risk of loss of the Reticles. While
in SCIs possession or control, SCI will store the Reticles as specified
below.

(a) _Archived Reticles_. Archived Reticles are those which have not been used
in the factory for twelve (12) months or longer. Archived Reticles are allowed
to be stored in LSIs current off-site Reticle storage facility at LSIs cost
and for a period of time which will be determined by LSI.

(b) _Inactive Reticles_. Inactive Reticles are those which have been used at

but are expected to be used during the following twelve (12) month period. SCI
will store Inactive Reticles at the Gresham Facilities in an environment of
no less than Class 1000 clean room airflow, with required temperature and
humidity ambient control.

(c) _Active Reticles_. Active Reticles are those which are either currently in
production, have been recently used for production, or are about to be used
for production. SCI will keep Active Reticles on the production floor so that
they can be quickly and safely utilized for Wafer processing.

(d) _Adjustments._ At SCIs request the foregoing time periods may be
modified as is appropriate consistent with the available Reticle storage at
the Gresham Facilities. It will be SCIs responsibility to retrieve any
Reticles stored as archived or inactive Reticles in a timely manner.

 

11\. WARRANTIES

11.1 Absence of Defects

(a) _Products_. SCI warrants that the Products delivered to LSI or its
Subsidiaries (or their respective customers) will be free from defects in
material and workmanship and will comply with all applicable Specifications
for a period of [*] from the date of delivery to LSI or its Subsidiary (or
LSIs or its Subsidiarys customer, if the Product is delivered directly to
the customer). SCIs warranty for In-Process Wafers and any Products partially
processed by a third party is limited to the actual work completed by SCI. If
any Products do not conform to the Specifications or contain defects in
material and workmanship, SCI will, at LSIs option, promptly either replace
the defective Products or credit LSI for the price paid for such defective
Products. If LSIs expected payments to SCI within the next [*] would not
be fully offset by the credit, LSI will have the right to require a cash
refund equal to the unused amount of the credit. The



 

24 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

warranty in this Section 11.1(a) does not apply to any failure in
conformance or defect resulting from damage to the Products that occurs after
the risk of loss of such Products has transferred to LSI nor to any failure in
conformance or defect to the extent arising as a result of LSIs design nor
for any other cause not attributable to defective materials or workmanship or
failure to meet Specifications on the part of SCI. This warranty extends to
LSIs Subsidiaries. SCI will not accept warranty claims directly from LSIs
customers or users of such customers Products.

(b) _Services_. SCI warrants that the Services will be performed in a
professional and timely manner, in conformance with all applicable processes
and Specifications. If any of the Services do not comply with this warranty,
upon request of LSI or its Subsidiaries, SCI will promptly reperform the
Services such that they do conform, at no additional cost or expense to LSI
or its Subsidiaries.

11.2 Reliability Risk / Epidemic Failures. In the event a defect in
material or workmanship or failure to meet Specifications is discovered in
any Product, including any defect that is not identified by the requisite
Product test screens, sort or final testing, and such defect would indicate an
unacceptable reliability risk to the performance or expected life of such
Product, the Parties will promptly cooperate by doing a failure analysis to
ascertain the root cause for such defect. SCI will make all commercially
reasonable efforts to implement appropriate manufacturing changes to prevent
the reoccurrence of any such defects. For the purposes of this Agreement,
"Epidemic Failure" will be deemed to have occurred if more than [*] of any
Wafer Lot, shipment, or Order should fail in substantially the same manner.
In the case of Epidemic Failure, SCI and LSI will promptly cooperate to
resolve the Epidemic Failure and implement the following procedure:

(a) _Notice_. Within five (5) Business Days after learning of such Epidemic
Failure or receipt of notice thereof from LSI, SCI will give LSI an initial
written response indicating its plan for diagnosing the problem.

(b) _Solution_. SCI will exert all commercially reasonable efforts to diagnose
the problem and plan a permanent solution and, if necessary, a work-around
for temporary use until the solution is implemented. If requested by SCI, LSI
will provide reasonable technical assistance to SCI to assist in determining
the cause and appropriate corrective actions for the Epidemic Failure. SCI
will promptly reimburse LSI for LSIs reasonable costs associated with
providing such assistance. SCI and LSI will mutually agree on a plan to
resolve the Epidemic Failure.

(c) _Effect on Products_. LSI and its Subsidiaries will have the option to
refuse delivery of affected Products, cancel any outstanding Orders for the
affected Product, and/or return for a cash refund all defective Products and
any Products that may be susceptible to the Epidemic Failure. In addition, to
the extent the Products still exist as stand-alone components, LSI may
return to SCI all defective Products and any Products that may be susceptible
to the same failure. The amounts for Products paid or that would have been
paid by LSI (or a Subsidiary of LSI) pursuant to an Order for which delivery
is refused or the Order is cancelled by LSI (or its Subsidiary) pursuant to
this Section 11.2 will be deemed to be Qualified Purchases. LSI will use
commercially reasonable efforts to place other Orders for other Products to an
equivalent purchase price amount within the Revenue Commitment Period [*].



 

25 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

(d) _Costs Relating to Epidemic Failure_. SCI will be responsible for all
costs incurred in rectifying any Epidemic Failure including for any solutions,
recovery plans, recalls, field replacements, and engineering changes.

11.3 Persistent Performance Problems. If at any time LSI believes problems
regarding yield, cycle time, defect density, or other performance metrics
relating to the Products are persistent or are not being satisfactorily
resolved by SCI, LSI will have the right to escalate such issues to SCI senior
management for resolution and SCI will promptly cooperate with LSI to resolve
such issues.

11.4 Disclaimer of Warranties. THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THIS SECTION 11 ARE
IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY,
REGARDING THE SERVICES AND THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

12. INDEMNIFICATION

12.1 By LSI. LSI will indemnify and hold harmless SCI and its Subsidiaries
from any and all third party claims or suits brought against SCI or any of
its Subsidiaries alleging that the manufacture of or sale to LSI or its
Subsidiaries of Products, or the provision of Services to LSI or its
Subsidiaries, by SCI or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement infringes
or misappropriates such third partys Proprietary Rights, to the extent that
such infringement or misappropriation results from either (a) the compliance
by SCI or its Subsidiaries with LSIs specifications as set forth in the
Licensed Materials, or (b) the use by SCI or its Subsidiaries of the same
equipment, materials, manufacturing methods, and process technologies as those
used by LSI or its Subsidiaries at the Gresham Facilities immediately prior
to the Closing (provided that, with respect to any alleged infringement or
misappropriation that occurs [*], SCI must be able to produce pre-existing
documentation clearly showing that the equipment, materials, manufacturing
methods, and process technologies in question are in fact the same as those
used by LSI or its Subsidiaries at the Gresham Facilities immediately prior to
the Closing) ("LSI-Related Claims"). LSI will defend at its own expense any
action or proceeding against SCI or its Subsidiaries based on such LSI-
Related Claims and will pay those costs and damages that are specifically
attributable to such LSI-Related Claims that are finally awarded against SCI
or its Subsidiaries or agreed to a monetary settlement of such action or
proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, LSI will have no obligation under
this Section 12.1 or otherwise with respect to any infringement or
misappropriation claim based upon (i) a deviation by SCI or its Subsidiaries
from any LSI specification set forth in the Licensed Materials to the extent
that such deviation results in the alleged infringement or misappropriation,
or (ii) compliance with any LSI specification set forth in the
Licensed Materials to the extent there was a non-infringing and commercially
reasonable way to implement such specification, after LSI shall have notified
SCI in writing pursuant to Section 15.6 of this Agreement of such non-
infringing way and SCI had a reasonable opportunity to implement such
specification. This Section 12.1 states



 

26 LSIs entire liability and SCIs sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement for any infringement or misappropriation claims relating to any
Product or Service, any LSI specification, any Licensed Material, or any other
information provided by LSI.

12.2 By SCI. SCI will indemnify and hold harmless LSI and its Subsidiaries
from any and all third party claims or suits brought against LSI or any of its
Subsidiaries (a) alleging that the manufacture of or sale to LSI or
its Subsidiaries of Products, or the provision of Services to LSI or its
Subsidiaries, by SCI or its Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement infringes
or misappropriates a third partys Proprietary Rights, to the extent that the
alleged infringement or misappropriation results from (i) a deviation by SCI
or its Subsidiaries from any LSI specification set forth in the Licensed
Materials (ii) compliance with any LSI specification set forth in the Licensed
Materials to the extent there was a non-infringing and commercially
reasonable way to implement such specification, after LSI shall have notified
SCI in writing pursuant to Section 15.6 of this Agreement of such non-
infringing way and SCI had a reasonable opportunity to implement such
specification., or (iii) the use by SCI or its Subsidiaries of equipment,
materials, manufacturing methods, or process technologies that are not the
same as those used by LSI or its Subsidiaries at the Gresham Facilities
immediately prior to the Closing (except for changes made to any of the
foregoing in this clause (iii) in compliance with Section 8.5 above, and,
provided that, with respect to any alleged infringement or misappropriation
that occurs more than two years after the Closing Date, it will be presumed,
unless SCI can produce pre-existing documentation, including by reference to
documentation covered by Section 8.5 above, clearly showing otherwise, that
the equipment, materials, manufacturing methods, or process technologies in
question were not the same as those used by LSI or its Subsidiaries at the
Gresham Facilities immediately prior to the Closing), or (b) arising from or
relating to any personal injury or death, or property damage, to the extent
arising from any actual or alleged defects in or malfunction of the Products
due to their manufacturing by SCI (collectively, the "SCI-Related Claims").
SCI will defend at its own expense any action or proceeding based on such
SCI-Related claims and will pay those costs and damages that are specifically
attributable to such SCI-Related claims that are finally awarded against LSI
or any of its Subsidiaries or agreed to in a monetary settlement of such
action or proceeding.

12.3 Procedures. As soon as an indemnified Party receives notice or otherwise
obtains knowledge of any third-party claim that may give rise to any claim
for indemnification hereunder, the indemnified Party will promptly provide the
indemnifying Party with written notice describing the third-party claim. The
indemnifying Party will have the right, at its election and at its sole
expense, to assume the defense of the third-party claim with its own counsel.
If the indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the third-party
claim, then the indemnifying Partys obligations under Section 12.1 or 12.2
above (as applicable) are subject to the conditions that the indemnified Party
(and its applicable Subsidiaries and, in the case of SCI, ON):

(a) give the indemnifying Party access to all information in the indemnified
Partys control that are reasonably relevant to the third-party claim (except
in instances where providing such access could destroy the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such information);



 

27 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

(b) not admit any liability with respect to the third-party claim;

(c) allow the indemnifying Party to control the defense and settlement of the
claim, and

(d) cooperate with the indemnifying Party, at the indemnifying Partys
reasonable request and expense, in defending or settling the claim. 

The indemnifying Party will have the exclusive right to settle, compromise, or
adjust the indemnified claim with the prior written consent of
the indemnified Party (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). If
the indemnifying Party elects not to assume control of the defense of the
third-party claim, then the indemnified Party will defend such third-party
claim using counsel of its choice and may settle, compromise, or adjust such
third-party claim on such terms as the indemnified Party may consider
appropriate without the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party. In
the event that the indemnifying Party elects not to assume control of the
defense of the third party claim, then the indemnifying Party shall be
responsible for all costs incurred and damages paid by the indemnified Party
as a result of the third party claim. The indemnifying Party will be
relieved of its obligations under this Section 12 as a result of the
indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or provide such cooperation
only if and to the extent that such failure prejudices the indemnifying
Partys ability to perform its obligations above.

13\. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO DAMAGES ARISING FROM A
BREACH OF SECTION 9 (CONFIDENTIALITY) AND EXCEPT FOR EACH PARTYS OBLIGATIONS
UNDER SECTION 12 (INDEMNIFICATION), IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE
FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST DATA AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY UPON WHICH SUCH DAMAGES ARE
CLAIMED AND EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EXCEPT FOR
BREACHES OF SECTION 9 (CONFIDENTIALITY) AND EXCEPT FOR EACH PARTYS
OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 12 (INDEMNIFICATION), EACH PARTYS TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PRODUCTS, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED [*] DURING THE [*] PERIOD
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND [*] UNDER THE [*] PERIOD UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (THE
"CAP"). THE APPLICABLE LIABILITY CAP FOR A PARTICULAR CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION
WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE PERIOD WHEN THE FIRST PRODUCT(S) UPON WHICH THE
CLAIM IS BASED WERE PRODUCED. AFTER THE FIRST [*] OF THE [*] EITHER PARTY MAY
PROPOSE A DIFFERENT CAP BASED UPON THE EXPECTED PURCHASE AND SALES VOLUMES OF
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FROM THAT POINT ONWARD AND THE
OTHER PARTY WILL NEGOTIATE TO AN APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENT TO THE CAP FOR
PROSPECTIVE PERIODS.



 

28 [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.

14\. TERM AND TERMINATION 

14.1 Term. The Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will continue
thereafter for a period of six (6) years ("Initial Term"), unless terminated
earlier as provided below. After the Initial Term unless terminated earlier as
provided below, the Agreement will automatically renew for successive periods
of two (2) years unless either Party has provided written notice of non-
renewal to the other Party at least six (6) months prior to the date of
expiration of the then-current term.

14.2 Discontinuation of Low-Demand Technology. After the [*] with respect to
the Gflx Process Technology and LSIs G12 and G11 process technologies, and
after the first [*] with respect to any other LSI process technology, SCI
then will have the right to notify LSI that SCI intends to discontinue support
of the Products for which demand has fallen below certain agreed upon minimum
volumes. If SCI, following [*] as stated above, elects to discontinue support
for such Products, SCI will provide LSI with prior written notice of [*] and
will cooperate with LSI as LSI may request in implementing and fulfilling a
last time buy process for LSIs end of life requirements for such Products
during such 24 month notice period.

14.3 Termination

(a) _For Breach_. Each Party will have the right to terminate this Agreement
by sending written notice of termination to the other Party if the other Party
(i) materially breaches this Agreement other than as a result of a Force
Majeure described in Section 15.9 below and does not cure the breach within
sixty (60) days after receiving written notice thereof from the non-breaching
Party, or (b) ceases to conduct business or begins winding up its affairs,
becomes the subject of proceedings in bankruptcy, enters into an assignment
for the benefit of its creditors, or appoints a receiver or trustee or has a
receiver or trustee appointed for it.

(b) _For Change of Control_. LSI will have the right to terminate this
Agreement in the event of a Change of Control of SCI or ON if LSI does not
consent to such Change of Control (which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld).

14.4 Transition Services. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement
for any reason, SCI will cooperate with LSI and at LSIs request promptly
assist LSI in the preparation and execution of a plan to transition the supply
of Products and Services to another provider. After the expiration or
termination of this Agreement while LSI is transitioning the supply of
Products and Services to another provider, SCI will continue to fulfill Orders
submitted by LSI, as long as the Gresham Facilities has capacity to fulfill
the Orders. SCI will cooperate with LSI and the alternate provider of
Products and Services during this transition and will provide information,
technology, training, and intellectual property licenses to the alternate
provider of the Products and Services as reasonably requested by LSI.

14.5 Effects of Termination. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement,
except for termination for LSIs breach pursuant to Section 14.3(a) above,
SCI will fulfill all Orders placed under this Agreement prior to the effective
date of



  

29 termination pursuant to all performance requirements of this Agreement with
regard to the satisfactory manufacture, quality, reporting, inspection and
delivery of Products and Services. Promptly upon expiration or termination of
this Agreement, and except as provided below, all licenses granted to SCI
hereunder will immediately cease and SCI will promptly return to LSI all
Licensed Material or certify in writing to LSI that the Licensed Materials
have all been destroyed, except to the extent that SCI is permitted to retain
and/or use any portion of the Licensed Materials pursuant to another agreement
with LSI. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SCI will have the right to continue
to exercise the licenses granted in this Agreement and to use the Licensed
Material after the termination or expiration of this Agreement solely for the
time period during which SCI continues to manufacture or provide Products or
perform Services using such Licensed Material for LSI or any of its
Subsidiaries. Sections 1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.4, 14.5, 15 will survive
expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

15\. GENERAL PROVISIONS

15.1 Assignment. Neither Party may assign or transfer, by operation of law or
otherwise, any of its rights under this Agreement (including any licenses
granted hereunder) or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any
third party without the other Partys prior written consent. Any attempted
assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be void.

(a) _Assignment by SCI_. Notwithstanding Section 15.1 above, upon the prior
written consent of LSI, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, SCI
will have the right to assign this Agreement in connection with a Change of
Control of SCI. If LSI does not consent to an assignment of this Agreement in
connection with a Change of Control of SCI and elects to terminate this
Agreement as provided in Section 14.3(b), SCI will (and will cause the
acquiring party to) provide all reasonable support and assistance to LSI for
the transition to LSIs designated alternate source of the supply of Products
and Services provided to LSI under this Agreement.

(b) _Assignment by LSI_. Notwithstanding Section 15.1 above, up on written
notice to SCI, LSI will have the right to assign this Agreement in connection
with a Change of Control of LSI.

15.2 Compliance with Laws. Each Party will be required to comply with
all applicable rules and laws in the performance of its responsibilities
under the Agreement including those relating to export licenses and
regulations, government permits and government authorizations.

15.3 Resolution of Disputes. With respect to any dispute that arises from or
relates to this Agreement, the Parties will first attempt to resolve the
dispute cooperatively by escalating resolution of the dispute within each
Party. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute cooperatively, then
prior to either Party taking action in a court of law, the Parties will submit
the dispute to mandatory mediation with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services (JAMS). The Parties will mutually agree on the identity of the
mediator who will resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to agree on a
mediator, a neutral mediator will be selected by JAMS. Nothing in this
Section 15.3 will prevent either Party from seeking injunctive relief.



 

30 15.4 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with, and
governed in all respects by, the laws of the State of California (without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of law).

15.5 Venue and Jurisdiction. If any legal proceeding or other legal action
relating to this Agreement is brought or otherwise initiated, the venue
therefor will be in the State of California, which will be deemed to be a
convenient forum. Each Party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents and
submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of
California.

15.6 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to either Party under this Agreement must be in writing and will be
deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service, or by facsimile) to
the address or facsimile telephone number set forth beneath the name of such
Party below (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number as such
Party will have specified in a written notice given to the other Party):

15.7 Remedies. Except as provided in Section 4.5 and Section 12.1, the
Parties rights and remedies under this Agreement are cumulative. Each Party
acknowledges that any actual or threatened breach of Section 9
(Confidentiality) or Section 10 (Ownership) will constitute immediate,
irreparable harm to the nonbreaching Party for which monetary damages would
be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy
for such breach. If either Party continues to use the Proprietary Rights of
the other Party after its right to do so has terminated or expired, the
nonbreaching Party will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief without the
requirement of posting bond.

15.8 Independent Contractor. Each Partys relationship to the other Party is
that of an independent contractor, and neither Party is an agent or partner of
the other. Neither Party will have, and will not represent to any third party
that it has, any authority to act on behalf of the other Party.



 

31 15.9 Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" means any act, event, or occurrence beyond
a Partys control, despite its reasonable efforts to prevent, avoid, delay,
or mitigate such acts, events, or occurrences, which directly impairs such
Partys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including
acts of God, fires, floods, storms, landslides, epidemics, lightning,
earthquakes, drought, blight, famine, quarantine, blockade, governmental acts
or inaction, orders or injunctions, war, insurrection, terrorist activities,
and civil strife. A Party will not be liable for any delays in performance of
its obligations under this Agreement caused by a Force Majeure. However, if it
appears that the Force Majeure will result in a delay in such Partys
performance, the other Party may take whatever steps it deems necessary or
appropriate to protect its interests and fulfill its obligations to its
customers (including shifting manufacturing of its products to other
facilities or sources and in the case of LSI or its Subsidiaries, canceling
outstanding Orders for Products), and if it appears the delay will last more
than sixty (60) days, the other Party may, at its option, terminate this
Agreement by written notice to the Party delayed in its performance. If this
Agreement is not terminated as a result of the Force Majeure or otherwise,
the affected Party will resume performance of its obligations under this
Agreement as soon as reasonably possible, and the rights and obligations of
the Parties under this Agreement (including LSIs obligations under Section
3) will be equitably adjusted as necessary on account of such delay.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the supply of Products to LSI and its
Subsidiaries under this Agreement is interrupted or substantially diminished
as a result of a Force Majeure affecting SCI for a period of more than sixty
(60) days, LSI will be excused from all further obligations under Section 3\.

15.10 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence in this Agreement.

15.11 Public Announcements. Except as may be required by any law, rule, or
regulation of any government body, neither Party will (and neither Party will
permit any of its advisors, representatives, or affiliates to) issue any
press release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement without
the other Partys prior written consent.

15.12 Parties in Interest. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to provide
any rights or remedies to any other person or entity other than the Parties
and LSIs Subsidiaries, which are entitled to place Orders and
purchase Products and Services under this Agreement.

15.13 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of
such provision to any person or entity or set of circumstances, is determined
to be invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable to any extent, the remainder
of this Agreement, and the application of such provision to persons, entities
or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be invalid,
unlawful, void, or unenforceable, will not be affected and will continue to be
valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

15.14 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement, the
Master NDA, and the other Ancillary Agreements set forth the
entire understanding of the Parties and supersede all other agreements and
understandings between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
thereof.



 

32 15.15 Waiver. No failure on the part of either Party to exercise any power,
right, privilege, or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
either Party in exercising any power, right, privilege, or remedy under this
Agreement, will operate as a waiver thereof; and no single or partial exercise
of any such power, right, privilege, or remedy will preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege, or remedy.

15.16 Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered, or
supplemented except by means of a written instrument executed on behalf of
both Parties.

15.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which will constitute an original and all of which, when taken
together, will constitute one agreement.

15.18 Interpretation of Agreement

(a) Each Party acknowledges that it has participated in the drafting of this
Agreement, and any applicable rule of construction to the effect that
ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting Party will not be applied
in connection with the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

(b) Whenever required by the context hereof, the singular number will include
the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender will include the feminine and
neuter genders; and the neuter gender will include the masculine and feminine
genders.

(c) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and
variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, and will be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the word "will" is equivalent in meaning
to the word "shall," both of which describe an act or forbearance which is
mandatory under this Agreement.

(e) Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Agreement to
"Sections" and "Attachments" are intended to refer to Sections of and
Attachments to this Agreement.

(f) The bold-faced headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only, will not be deemed to be a part of this Agreement, and will
not be referred to in connection with the construction or interpretation of
this Agreement.



 

33 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement as of the
Effective Date.

(Section 5.4)

Valuing In-process WIP and Raw Wafers



   1.0 | LSI will continue to own the WIP and raw wafers as of the closing
date, but will assign that WIP and raw wafers to the new buyer for completion.
All Rapid Chip slice inventories remain the property of LSI. 
---|--- 



   2.0 | At the close timing on the day of closing, LSI will take an
accounting of all of the work in process (including any lots on hold and
engineering wafers) according to the Promis costing system. LSI will also
take an accounting of all raw wafers, quartz and targets on hand including
inventoried and expensed raw wafers. . 
---|--- 



   3.0 | Each production and prototype lot will be assigned a percentage
of completion based on the standard cost for the stages completed over the
standard cost for the total stages for that lot through E-test. Engineering
wafers will be assigned a standard cost based on their stage of completion in
Promis. This percentage of completion will then be applied to the applicable
wafer pricing by technology pursuant to Attachment B-1. The resulting
calculation will be the in process wafer completion value. The raw wafers,
quartz and targets will be valued at cost and that value will be added to the
in process wafer completion value. 
---|--- 


   4.0 | SCI will bill LSI for the full value of the sorted Die or Wafers
based upon the agreed to pricing in Attachment B-1 for Wafers or the Die
pricing as determined by the methodology in Attachment B-5, as applicable.
SCI will then give LSI credit for the value resulting from the calculation of
the in process wafer completion and raw wafers, quartz and targets in
paragraph 3 above. This dollar credit shall be applied in one
third increments in months one, two and three of the agreement. 
---|--- 



   5.0 | For any Wafers in sort and not included in the WIP credit
calculation at the time of closing, SCI will only bill the reaming sort time
needed to complete the sorting of those lots. Any Die in Wafer form at the
facility as of the closing date is considered complete and SCI will not bill
LSI for these Wafers and will ship to LSI upon request with no charge. 
---|--- 


   6.0 | Any expedite fees will only be paid on in-process lots that go on
expedite after the date of closing, and the expedite fee shall be prorated
based on the stage of completion at the time of closing. 
---|--- 



   7.0 | If there are lots that are on an expedited status at the time of
close, these lots will get charged the prorated expedited amount from close to
completion (of steps that are processed as expedites). 
---|--- 



   8.0 | LSI and SCI will work together to ascertain a reasonable value of
any ARO wafers that are in process at the time of closing. This value will be
a credit to LSI in the first quarter of the Agreement. [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed

Fees for Expedited Processing:



Super Hot Lot (Priority 1)[*] regardless of technology (see attached
_Attachment C_ on related DPML cycle times)



Hot Lot (Priority 2)[*] regardless of technology (see attached _Attachment
C_ on related DPML cycle times)



Above fees will be prorated over the number of processing moves that receive
expedited treatment, if the lot is not expedited from start to finish.



If the expedited lot does not meet the SCI committed date, such expedite fees
that would customarily be charged would be waived by SCI.



Prototype Pricing Premium. The prototype pricing premium will be [*] of the
regular production price for the applicable Product. DPML cycle times for such
prototype are set forth in _Attachment C_.



Wafer Sort and Engineering Test Services: [*] of test equipment on all non-
consigned equipment.



Consigned test equipment, including but not limited to the Advantest and the
laser repair equipment, fees of [*] of test equipment time will be charged.



Small Lot Charge: All small lots that are started in a given week above the
[*] or [*] allowed will be charged at a premium of [*] of the base price
(adder)



LVR Pricing Premium: All production lots that are run utilizing the non rapid
chip LVR reticle capability will be charged a premium of [*] of the base price
(adder) after the [*] (G12) or [*] (Gflx) limit has been reached on a
particular product.

To show application of Carry Over of Excess / Shortfall under



The following are examples of the QMPA, and how to deal with excess / shortage
and carry-forward.



Excess:



Per the wafer supply agreement, the following are the revenue commitments by
LSI:



QMPA for Q2, 06 [*]

QMPA for Q3, 06 [*]



At the end of Q2, assume the actual revenue was [*] from LSI



Hence, additional revenue from LSI = [*][*] = [*]



[*] of [*] = [*]



Because the [*] exceeds the [*], only [*] of additional revenue of Q2 will be
used to offset LSIs Q3 commitment.



Hence, LSIs contractual Q3 commitment still would be [*] of which [*] would
already have been fulfilled at the commencement of Q3.



Shortfall:



Per the wafer supply agreement, the following are the revenue commitments by
LSI:



QMPA for Q2, 06 [*]

QMPA for Q3, 06 [*]



At the end of Q2, assume the actual revenue was [*] from LSI



Hence, shortfall of revenue from LSI = [*][*] = [*]



[*] of [*] = $[*]



Hence, LSI would have to pay, per payment terms, [*] to SCI and the balance
of [*] would be added to the Q3 contractual revenue commitment of LSI. The new
Q3 revenue commitment would be [*]. [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed

Attachment B-5

(Section 5.2 (a))

Methodology for "price per good die" and bumped wafers



Price per good die (sorted die)



   1.0 | Die based pricing, based on sorted Die, will be used for products
which have more than [*] wafers produced by Gresham, including Wafers produced
before the "Effective Date". 
---|--- 



   2.0 | Wafer based pricing is used for products with [*] Wafers. 
---|--- 



   3.0 | For Die based pricing, a NDPW factor is established using the
actual mean yields of the nearest [*] months for each product that has [*]
Wafers produced. 
---|--- 
 



   4.0 | The Wafer price for the quarter the product is requested or
shipped (whichever is later) is used to calculate the price per good Die or
the Wafer pricing whichever is applicable.  
---|--- 



   5.0 | This price is used for invoicing purposes on Product shipped. The
actual quantity shipped times the unit price is used for invoicing purposes. 
---|--- 


   6.0 | SCI acknowledges that LSI uses statistical post processing (SPP),
whereby some Die, that pass all electrical parameters are still not used for
assembly into final products as there is a higher likelihood of encountering
reliability failures and a higher DPPM fallout. 
---|--- 



   7.0 | Products which are on SPP as of the "Effective Date" 
---|--- 



     | 7.1 | LSI will continue using SPP on Products that are currently
on SPP as of the Effective Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.2 | SCI will invoice LSI for these Die based on "Post SPP based
die". 
---|---|--- 



   8.0 | Products which are wafer based pricing and on SPP as of the
"Effective Date" 
---|--- 



     | 8.1 | LSI will continue using SPP on products that are currently
on SPP as of the Effective Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.2 | SCI will invoice LSI for Wafers until the [*] Wafers limit
is reached. Wafer pricing used will be based on attachment B-1. Once [*]
Wafers have been shipped, SCI will invoice LSI for these die based on "Post-
SPP based Die". 
---|---|--- 



   9.0 | Products which are on not on SPP as of the "Effective Date" but
subsequently are on SPP during the term of the contract 
---|--- 


     | 9.1 | For the months, the Products are not on SPP, Die based
pricing based on sorted good die will be used for invoicing purposes (or Wafer
based pricing if [*] Wafers produced for that Product) 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.2 | When the Product is switched to SPP by LSI, SCI will invoice
LSI for these Die based on "Post SPP based Die". 
---|---|--- [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk on this page have been omitted and filed
separately with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to a request
for confidential treatment.



Bumped Wafers



   10.0 | Wafers that are fabricated in Gresham and bumped at some other
sub-contractor of LSI. 
---|--- 



     | 10.1 | SCI will ship Wafers that require bumping to the location
specified by LSI. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.2 | SCI will invoice LSI the applicable non-sorted Wafer price: 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.3 | Wafer Products for which [*] Wafers have been manufactured,
if the actual Die yields for such Products, (after bump and sort yield or SPP
as applicable) is lower than the expected NDPW due to a Wafer processing
cause, LSI shall be entitled to a credit for the shortfall in the actual NDPW
as compared to the expected NDPW. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10.4 | Similarly, for bumped Wafer Products for which [*] wafers
have been manufactured, if the actual Die yields for such Products (after bump
and sort yield or SPP as applicable) is higher than the expected NDPW, SCI
shall be entitled to invoice LSI for the excess in the actual NDPW as compared
to the expected NDPW.

Form of Intellectual Property License Agreement

Attached below. [*] Portions denoted with an asterisk in this agreement (and its related
exhibits) have been omitted and filed separately with the Securities and
Exchange Commission pursuant to a request for confidential treatment.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE AGREEMENT 

This INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is being
entered into as of the Closing Date, by and between LSI LOGIC CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation ("LSI"); LSI LOGIC HK HOLDINGS, an Exempted Company
organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands ("LSI Holdings"); SEMICONDUCTOR
COMPONENTS INDUSTRIES, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("SCI"); and
ON SEMICONDUCTOR TRADING LTD., a corporation organized under the laws of
Bermuda ("ON Trading"). In this Agreement, LSI, LSI Holding, SCI, and ON
Trading are referred to collectively as the "Parties" and each of them is
sometimes referred to individually as a "Party."

RECITALS

A. LSI and SCI entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated April _ _,
2006 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which LSI has agreed to
cause its and its subsidiaries right, title, and interest in and to certain
assets associated with LSIs semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in
Gresham, Oregon to be sold and transferred to SCI and SCI has agreed to
acquire the same from LSI and its subsidiaries.

B. Concurrently with the Closing, the Parties are entering into certain
Ancillary Agreements, including this Agreement, pursuant to which (among
other things): (a) LSI Holdings is granting to ON Trading and SCI certain
licenses to its Process Technology, Product Technology, Licensed Fab Software,
and Ancillary Technology (each as defined below); and (b) SCI is granting to
LSI and its Affiliates a license to the Fab Intellectual Property.

AGREEMENT

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1\. DEFINITIONS. Any capitalized term that is used but not expressly defined
in this Agreement will have the same meaning in this Agreement as the meaning
(if any) given to such term in the Asset Purchase Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement:

1.1 "Affiliate" of a Party means any person or entity that, at any time
during the term of this Agreement, directly or indirectly controls, is
controlled by, or is under common control with such Party, where "control"
means ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting power of the
outstanding voting securities (but only as long as such person or entity meets
these requirements); _provided, however,_ that in the case of SCI and ON
Trading, the term "Affiliate" excludes TPG Partners II, L.P., its parallel
funds, their general partners and their other portfolio companies
(collectively, "TPG"), and any other person or entity that would be an
"Affiliate" pursuant to the foregoing definition solely as a result of its
ownership by, or its control relationship with, TPG. 1.2 "Ancillary Technology" means the data, information, and know how of LSI
and its Affiliates (in existence as of the Closing Date) pertaining to the
Gresham Facilities operational procedures, protocols, and similar activities,
including automation, clean room control, and central plant process
operations, that is resident at the Gresham Facilities and that is not
specifically associated with any Process Technology, Product Technology,
Licensed Fab Software, or Fab Software.

1.3 "Applicable IP Rights" means all: (a) rights associated with works of
authorship (whether or not registered), including copyrights and mask work
rights, (b) trade secret rights, and (c) other types of legally recognized
rights in know-how and other intangible assets (other than Patents, and
trademark and service mark rights, trade dress rights, trade name rights, and
similar branding rights).

1.4 "ASIC" means an application specific integrated circuit.

1.5 "Assert" means to bring, as a Plaintiff, an action of any nature before
any legal, judicial, arbitration, administrative, executive, or other type of
body or tribunal that has or claims to have authority to adjudicate such
action in whole or in part. Examples of such body or tribunal include, United
States State and Federal Courts, the United States International
Trade Commission, and any foreign counterparts of any of the foregoing.

1.6 "Change in Control" means, with respect to a Party (or ON), the
occurrence of any of the following events: (a) any consolidation or merger of
such Party (or ON) with or into any other entity in which the holders of such
Partys (or ONs) outstanding shares immediately before such consolidation or
merger do not, immediately after such consolidation or merger, retain stock
representing a majority of the voting power of the surviving entity or stock
representing a majority of the voting power of an entity that wholly
owns, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity; (b) the sale, transfer,
or assignment of securities of such Party (or ON) representing a majority of
the voting power of all of such Partys (or ONs) outstanding voting
securities to an acquiring party or group, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions; or (c) the sale of all or substantially all of
such Partys (or ONs) assets. Any Change in Control of ON will also be deemed
to be a Change in Control of SCI and ON Trading, and any Change in Control of
LSI will also be deemed to be a Change in Control of LSI Holdings. In
addition, in the case of SCI and ON Trading, a "Change of Control" also means
and includes any transaction or series of transactions as a result of which
ON no longer has the power or authority to control and direct the business or
affairs of SCI or ON Trading, and in the case of LSI Holdings, a "Change of
Control" also means and includes any transaction or series of transactions as
a result of which LSI no longer has the power or authority to control and
direct the business or affairs of LSI Holdings.

6\. 2.5 Sublicensing

(a) Sublicensing Rights for Process Technology, Product Technology, and Fab
Software. As long as (A) ON Trading and SCI believe in good faith that ON
Trading, SCI, and its Affiliates are not in material breach of any obligation
under this Agreement or (with respect to the Process Technology, Product
Technology, or Licensed Fab Software) the Master NDA, and (B) neither ON
Trading nor SCI has been noticed by LSI Holdings or its Affiliates (pursuant
to Section 9.7 herein) that ON Trading, SCI, or any of its Affiliates is in
material breach of any obligation under this Agreement or (with respect to the
Process Technology, Product Technology, or Licensed Fab Software) the
Master NDA, ON Trading or SCI (or both) may sublicense the rights granted to
them in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3: (i) to any of its Affiliates; and (ii) to
a third party in connection with (x) the sale of any product lines that
is manufactured using all or a portion of the Process Technology, Product
Technology, and/or Licensed Fab Software, provided that the sublicense rights
granted to such third party are limited to the manufacture, use, and sale of
the products comprising the product lines (including future versions or
derivatives of such products) and include rights only under the Process
Technology, Product Technology, and/or Licensed Fab Software that are in use
in such product lines, or (y) SCIs (or any of its Affiliates) divestiture
after the Initial Period (as defined in the Wafer Supply Agreement) of a wafer
fabrication facility that uses all or a portion of the Process Technology,
Product Technology, and/or Licensed Fab Software, provided that the
sublicense rights granted to such third party include rights only under the
Process Technology, Product Technology, and/or Licensed Fab Software that are
in use in such facilities, and the sublicensee agrees in writing to use
the Process Technology, Product Technology, and/or Licensed Fab Software, or
the Modified Process Technology, Modified Product Technology, and/or Modified
Licensed Fab Software (as applicable), solely to manufacture and sell products
(including any existing or new products designed or developed by such third
party) at the divested facilities and not to manufacture any Restricted
Products during the Restricted Period.

(b) Sublicensing Rights for Ancillary Technology. ON Trading and SCI may
sublicense the rights granted to them in Section 2.4 to any of
their Affiliates and to any third party.

(c) Sublicensing Requirements. Any sublicense agreement entered into by SCI or
ON Trading as permitted by Section 2.5(a) (a "Sublicense Agreement") must
contain the license restrictions in Section 2.10 and other terms and
conditions that are at least as protective of LSI Holdings and its
Affiliates rights and interests in the Process Technology, Product
Technology, and Licensed Fab Software as the provisions of this Agreement and
of the Master NDA, and ON Trading or SCI must promptly notify LSI Holdings in
writing after such sublicense is granted. In addition, before exercising any
"have designed," "have developed", or "have manufactured" rights with respect
to a third party, ON Trading or SCI (as the case may be) must enter into a
binding written agreement with such third party (a "Contract Services
Agreement") that contains terms and conditions that are at least as protective
of LSI Holdings and its Affiliates rights and interests in the Process
Technology, Product Technology, and Licensed Fab Software as the provisions
of this Agreement and of the Master NDA. Each Sublicense Agreement must
include a provision stating the sublicenses granted to such third party will
automatically terminate, without notice, if such third party Asserts a patent
infringement claim against LSI or any of its Affiliates or (with respect to
LSI Products) any of



 

7\. their respective customers (it being understood that the Assertion by such
third party of a patent infringement claim against LSI or any of its
Affiliates or (with respect to LSI Products) any of their respective customers
will not terminate, diminish, or otherwise adversely affect ON Tradings or
SCIs rights under this Agreement, except as to ON Tradings and SCIs right
to sublicense such third party). ON Trading or SCI will promptly notify LSI
Holdings in writing if ON Trading or SCI (or any of their Affiliates) becomes
aware of any material breach of any Sublicense Agreement or Contract Services
Agreement by another party thereto relating to the Process Technology, Product
Technology, or Licensed Fab Software. In the event of any such third party
material breach relating to the Process Technology, Product Technology,
or Licensed Fab Software, the Parties agree to confer within ten (10)
business days after notice by ON Trading or SCI of such breach to discuss and
mutually agree upon, in good faith, an appropriate and reasonable course of
action with respect to such third party.

with no right to sublicense except to entities that are Affiliates of ON
Trading and SCI prior to any Change in Control of ON, ON Trading, or SCI, to
use the Licensed Fab Software, and combine the Licensed Fab Software with
other technology, in order to (i) design, have designed, develop, have
developed, improve, manufacture, have manufactured, distribute, market, and

SCI grants any sublicenses to any of its Affiliates as permitted by this
Agreement, neither LSI nor any of its Subsidiaries will be responsible or
liable for any taxes imposed on or resulting from such sublicenses.

2.13 No Implied License. The licenses granted in Sections 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4,
2.6, 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 are not intended to confer, by implication, estoppel,
or otherwise, upon ON Trading



 

9\. or SCI or any of their Affiliates a license to or any rights in any
trademarks, service marks, trade dress rights, trade name rights, or similar
rights of LSI Holdings or any of its Affiliates. All rights not expressly
granted by LSI Holdings in this Agreement are reserved by LSI Holdings and its
Affiliates.

3\. SCI LICENSE GRANTS

3.1 License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SCI
(on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) hereby grants to LSI Holdings and its
Affiliates a non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free, perpetual

technology transfer, or provide any technical assistance or training.

7\. CONFIDENTIALITY. Any disclosure of any confidential information of any
Party (or any of their respective Affiliates) under this Agreement will be
governed by the terms of the Master NDA. LSIs Confidential Information (as
defined in the Master NDA) includes the Process Technology, the Product
Technology, the Licensed Fab Software, and the Ancillary Technology.

THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT), INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-

partnership, joint venture, employment, or other relationship between the
Parties except that of independent contractors.

9.4 Resolution of Disputes. With respect to any dispute that arises from or

prior to either Party taking action in a court of law, the Parties will submit
the dispute to mandatory mediation with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation

mediator who will resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to agree on a
mediator, a neutral mediator will be selected by JAMS. Nothing in this Section
9.4 will prevent either Party from seeking injunctive relief.

3\. EXHIBIT F

Form of Transition Services Agreement

Attached below. TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is being entered into as
of the Closing Date, by and between SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS INDUSTRIES, LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business at
5005 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85008 ("SCI"), and LSI LOGIC
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at
1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA 95035 ("LSI"). In this Agreement, LSI and SCI
are referred to collectively as the "Parties" and each of them is sometimes
referred to individually as a "Party."

RECITALS

A. SCI and LSI are parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated April
, 2006 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which LSI has agreed to
cause its and its subsidiaries right, title, and interest in and to certain
assets associated with LSIs semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in
Gresham, Oregon to be sold and transferred to SCI and SCI has agreed to
acquire the same from LSI and its Subsidiaries.

B. The Parties wish to arrange for certain services to be provided by one
Party to the other Party during a transition period beginning on the closing
of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

AGREEMENT

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1\. DEFINITIONS. Any capitalized term that is used but not expressly defined
in this Agreement will have the same meaning in this Agreement as the meaning
(if any) given to such term in the Asset Purchase Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement:

1.1 "Affiliate" of a Party means any Person that, at any time during the term
of this Agreement, directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with such Party, where "control" means ownership of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities
(but only as long as such Person meets these requirements); provided,
however, that in the case of ON Semiconductor Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, "Affiliate" shall exclude TPG Partners II, L.P., its parallel
funds, their general partners and their other portfolio
companies (collectively, "TPG") and any other Person that would be an
"Affiliate" pursuant to the foregoing definition solely as a result of its
ownership by, or its control relationship with, TPG.

1.2 "Pass-Through Expenses" means the reasonable and actual out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Service Provider in the course of providing
Services, but not including any overhead costs, profits, or other mark-ups. 1.3 "Services" means the services, functions, and tasks to be provided by one
Party to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement as described in the
applicable Service Schedule, as such services, functions, and tasks may be
changed or supplemented during the _Term_ of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. 

1.4 "Service Provider" means, with respect to particular Services, the Party
that provides, or is obligated to provide, such Services.

1.5 "Service Receiver" means, with respect to particular Services, the Party
that receives, or is entitled to provide, such Services.

1.6 "Service Schedule" means a Schedule to this Agreement. Each such Schedule
describes (among other things) particular Services, the Service Provider, the
Service Term, and the fees (if any) to be paid by the Service Receiver to the
Service Provider for such Services.

1.7 "Service Term" means the period of time during which particular Services
will be provided, as set forth in the applicable Service Schedule.

2\. SERVICES

2.1 Performance of Services. The Service Provider will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, and as necessary will cause its Affiliates to
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, the Services to the Service
Receiver (and, as necessary, its Affiliates) during the Service Term for such
Services. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including
the applicable Service Schedule), the Service Provider will be responsible for
providing the equipment, personnel, and other resources required for
performance of the Services.

2.2 Reduction in Services. The Service Receiver may elect to suspend or not
to receive all or any part of the Services at any time upon notice to the
Service Provider. The Parties will meet monthly, make a mutual assessment of
the Services then being provided and make any appropriate adjustments in the
Service fees.

2.3 Additional Services. If either Party reasonably requests that the other
Party perform additional services not included within the scope of any
Services Schedule (an "Omitted Service"), then the Parties will promptly
negotiate in good faith with a view toward adding another Services Schedule to
this Agreement covering such additional services. However, no additional
Services Schedule will take effect or be binding on either Party until both
Parties have agreed in writing to such Services Schedule. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, LSI agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, at SCIs request, any Omitted Service that was
provided by LSI or its Affiliates to the Fab immediately before the Closing
and that is reasonably necessary for SCI to fulfill its obligations under the
Wafer Supply Agreement. 

2.4 Subcontracting. Each Party understands that the other Party may have
contracted, and may in the future contract, with third parties to provide
services in connection with all or any portion of the Services, including for
Omitted Services, to be provided under this    Agreement. Each Party reserves the right to continue to contract with third
parties to provide such services or to enter into new contract relationships
for such services.

2.5 Standard of Performance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, each Party understands and agrees that (a) the other Party is not
in the business of providing to third parties services such as those provided
under this Agreement, (b) accordingly, the standard of performance to which
the Service Provider will be accountable under this Agreement will be the use
of commercially reasonable efforts to achieve a comparable level of service as
the Service Provider provides to its own internal organization with respect to
similar services, and (c) under no circumstance will the Service Provider or
any of its employees or contractors be held to a higher standard of
performance.

2.6 Consents. If the Service Receivers or any of its Affiliates use of the
Services to be provided to it pursuant to this Agreement (or of any equipment
or software owned by or leased or licensed to the Service Provider or any of
its Affiliates) requires the consent, approval, or agreement of any third
party (a "Consent"), the Service Provider will use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such Consent as promptly as practicable, the Service
Receiver will reimburse the Service Provider for the costs of obtaining such
Consent (subject to the Service Receivers prior approval of such costs, which
will not be unreasonably withheld), and the Service Provider will not be
required to provide such Services (or allow the Service Receiver to use the
affected equipment or software) until all required Consents have been
obtained. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to mitigate the cost of
obtaining such Consents.

2.7 Cooperation; Access. (a) In order to enable the Service Provider to
perform Services, the Service Receiver will provide (and, as necessary, cause
its Affiliates to provide) the Service Provider with such cooperation and
assistance as the Service Provider reasonably requests. Such cooperation and
assistance will include providing to the Service Provider, in a timely
manner, answers to questions, information, and technical consultation. Each
Party acknowledges that its failure to perform its obligations under this
Agreement could result in delays on the part of the other Party in performing
the affected Services, or prevent performance by the other Party.

(b) The Service Receiver shall provide to the Service Provider reasonable
access to the premises of the Service Receiver and the systems, software and
networks located therein, to the extent necessary for the purpose of providing
the Services. The Service Provider shall ensure that it and its employees and
agents comply with the Service Receivers contractor, supplier and security
policies and procedures as may be provided to the Service Provider by the
Service Receiver from time to time.

2.8 Services Managers. Each Party will each appoint a single "Services
Manager" for each Service. The initial Services Manager for each Party will be
identified in the applicable Service Schedule and will serve as the primary
point of contact for the other Party for matters related to such Service.
Either Party may replace any of its Services Managers with an individual of
comparable qualifications and experience by notifying the other Party of such
new appointment. 3\. COMPENSATION

3.1 Fees. The Service Receiver will pay the Service Provider the fees (if any)
set forth in the applicable Service Schedule for the Services provided by the
Service Provider.

3.2 Pass-Through Expense Reimbursement. The Service Receiver will reimburse
the Service Provider for Pass-Through Expenses that are incurred by the
Service Provider in performing the Services and are invoiced to the Service
Receiver in accordance with Section 3.3. The nature and amount of the
anticipated Pass-Through Expenses for each Service are identified in
the applicable Service Schedule; any material deviations from these amounts
and any material Pass-Through Expenses not identified in the applicable
Service Schedule will be subject to written agreement of the Parties.

3.3 Invoicing and Payment. (a) Unless other payment terms are set forth in the
applicable Service Schedule and except as otherwise provided in Section
3.3(b), each calendar quarter during the Term, the Service Provider will issue
to the Service Receiver an invoice for the amount of the Fab related and
Service related expenses, fees and other charges, payable to the
Service Provider. The Service Receiver will pay the amount invoiced by the
Service Provider within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

(b) Fab related and Service related expenses, fees and other charges incurred
by the Service Provider in performing Services will be documented and be
available to the Service Receiver through the "Gresham Expense Flow" as
described in Schedule 2.

(c) All payments made pursuant to this Section 3.3 must be made in
U.S. Dollars, by check payable to the order of the Service Provider or by
wire transfer of the immediately available fund to a bank account previously
designated by the Service Provider.

3.4 Taxes. The fees of Service Provider for Services provided pursuant to this
Agreement exclude all excise, sales, use, gross receipts, value added, goods
and services, or similar transaction or revenue-based taxes applicable to the
provision of services and imposed by any federal, state, or local taxing
authority (such taxes, together with any applicable interest, penalties, or
additions to tax imposed with respect to such taxes, "Taxes"), and Service
Receiver will be responsible for payment of all such Taxes.

3.5 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each
Party will bear its own costs and expenses incurred in the performance of this
Agreement.

4\. CONFIDENTIALITY. Any disclosure of any confidential information of either
Party pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement will be governed by
the terms of the Nondisclosure Agreement between LSI and SCI being entered
into concurrently with this Agreement as part of the transactions contemplated
by the Asset Purchase Agreement, as it may be amended from time to time (the
"Master NDA"). 5\. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

5.1 Waiver. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,
INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST DATA
AND LOST PROFITS, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT.

5.2 Liability Limit. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT, IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF A PARTY UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES AND PASS-THROUGH EXPENSES OWED OR
PAID BY SUCH PARTY TO THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

6\. DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN, THE SERVICE PROVIDER
MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES IT
PROVIDES, AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Nothing in this Section 6
will impair any rights or remedies of either LSI or SCI under the Asset
Purchase Agreement.

 

7\. TERM AND TERMINATION

7.1 Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement begins on the Closing Date
and, unless extended by written agreement of the Parties pursuant to Section
7.2 or terminated earlier pursuant to Section 7.3, will continue until the
earlier of (a) the termination or expiration of each Service Term under all
Service Schedules or (b) the date that is 120 days after the Closing
Date (the "Term").

7.2 Extensions. The Parties acknowledge that it is in their mutual best
interests to cooperate to achieve a smooth transition and adequate support of
their respective activities at the Gresham Facilities after the Closing Date.
Accordingly, if the Service Receiver reasonably believes, as the end of the
applicable Service Term or the Term approaches, that the need for a Service
will continue beyond such Service Term or the Term, then at the Service
Receivers request, the Parties will confer and attempt in good faith to agree
on the terms of an extension of the Service Term or the Term. 

7.3 Termination for Cause. Each Party will have the right to terminate the
term of this Agreement, or the Service Term for any particular Service
Schedule, immediately upon written notice to the other Party, if the other
Party materially breaches any term of this Agreement or such Service Schedule
and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after being given
written notice of such breach by the non-breaching Party.

7.4 Effect of Termination. Neither Party will be liable to the other Party
because of any proper termination of this Agreement for compensation,
reimbursement, or damages for the loss of prospective profits, anticipated
sales, or goodwill. The following provisions of this Agreement will survive
its termination or expiration: Sections 1, 3 (with respect to Services
performed prior to termination or expiration), 5, 6, 7.3, and 8. 8\. GENERAL PROVISIONS

8.1 Compliance with Laws. Each Party agrees that it will, in the course of
exercising the rights licensed or sublicensed to it in this Agreement, comply
with all applicable rules and laws, including export and import control laws
and regulations.

8.2 Independent Contractors. This Agreement is not intended to establish any
partnership, joint venture, employment, or other relationship between the
Parties except that of independent contractors.

8.3 Resolution of Disputes. With respect to any dispute that arises from or
relates to this Agreement, the Parties will first attempt to resolve the
dispute cooperatively by escalating resolution of the dispute within each
Party. If the Parties are unable to resolve the dispute cooperatively, then
prior to either Party taking action in a court of law, the Parties will submit
the dispute to mandatory mediation with Judicial Arbitration and
Mediation Services (JAMS). The Parties will mutually agree on the identity of
the mediator who will resolve the dispute. If the Parties are unable to agree
on a mediator, a neutral mediator will be selected by JAMS. Nothing in this
Section 8.3 will prevent either Party from seeking injunctive relief.

8.4 Governing Law. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with,
and governed in all respects by, the laws of the State of _California_
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law).

8.5 Venue and Jurisdiction. If any legal proceeding or other legal action
relating to this Agreement is brought or otherwise initiated, the venue
therefor will be in the State of California, which will be deemed to be a
convenient forum. Each Party hereby expressly and irrevocably consents and
submits to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of
California. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party remains free to assert
its rights under this Agreement or invoke this Agreement as a defense in
connection with any legal proceeding or action (including arbitration
proceedings) involving any third party.

8.6 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to either LSI or SCI (or any of their respective Subsidiaries) under
this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed properly delivered,
given and received when delivered (by hand, by registered mail, by courier or
express delivery service or by facsimile) to the address or facsimile
telephone number set forth beneath the name of such Party below (or to such
other address or facsimile telephone number as such Party will have specified
in a written notice given to the other Party):

release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement without the
other Partys prior written consent.

8.8 Force Majeure. "Force Majeure" means any act, event, or occurrence beyond
a Partys control, despite its reasonable efforts to prevent, avoid, delay,
or mitigate such acts, events, or occurrences, which directly impairs such
Partys ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement, including
acts of God, fires, floods, storms, landslides, epidemics, lightning,
earthquakes, drought, blight, famine, quarantine, blockade, governmental acts
or inaction, orders or injunctions, war, insurrection, terrorist activities,
and civil strife. A Party will not be liable for any delays in performance of
its obligations under this Agreement caused by a Force Majeure.

neither Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations
under this Agreement (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by way of merger, or
otherwise) to any third party without the prior written consent of the other
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may assign this entire
Agreement to any of its Affiliates or to any successor in the event of a
Change in Control of such Party, provided that such Affiliate or successor
agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement and to assume all of the
assigning Partys obligations under this Agreement. Any attempted assignment
of rights or delegation of obligations under this Agreement in breach or
violation of this Section 8.9 will be null and void.

rights or remedies to any other person or entity other than the Parties and
each Partys Affiliates, to the extent such Affiliates are entitled to receive
Services under this Agreement.

8.11 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of

Form of Facilities Use Agreement

Attached below. FACILITIES USE AGREEMENT

This FACILITIES USE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is being entered into as of
the Closing Date, by and between SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS INDUSTRIES, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business at
5005 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85008 ("SCI"), and LSI LOGIC
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at
1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA 95035 ("LSI"). In this Agreement, LSI and SCI
are referred to collectively as the "Parties" and each of them is sometimes
referred to individually as a "Party."

RECITALS

A. SCI and LSI are parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated April  _
_, 2006 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which LSI has agreed to
cause its and its subsidiaries right, title, and interest in and to certain
assets associated with LSIs semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in
Gresham, Oregon to be sold and transferred to SCI and SCI has agreed to
acquire the same from LSI and its subsidiaries.

B. During a period beginning on the closing of the transactions contemplated
by the Asset Purchase Agreement, certain LSI personnel and contractors will
need access to the fabrication facilities and will need to store, access, and
use certain LSI equipment at such facilities. LSI desires to obtain from SCI,
and SCI desires to give to LSI, certain rights to access the fabrication
facilities and to access, store, and use the LSI equipment at the
fabrication facilities during such period.

AGREEMENT

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

1\. Definitions. Any capitalized term that is used but not expressly defined
in this Agreement will have the same meaning in this Agreement as the meaning
(if any) given to such term in the Asset Purchase Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement:

1.1 "Affiliate" of a Party means any Person that, at any time during the term
of this Agreement, directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with such Party, where "control" means ownership of an
amount of the voting securities or other voting ownership interests sufficient
to elect at least a majority of such other Persons board of directors or
other governing body (or, if there are no such interests, more than 50% of the
equity interests), but only as long as such Person meets these requirements;
_provided, however,_ that in the case of SCI and ON Trading, the term
"Affiliate" excludes TPG Partners II, L.P., its parallel funds, their general
partners and their other portfolio companies (collectively, "TPG"), and any
other person or entity that would be an "Affiliate" pursuant to the foregoing
definition solely as a result of its ownership by, or its control relationship
with, TPG.

1.2 "Authorized Areas" means the portions of the Gresham Facilities
designated on Exhibit A as such (other than the LSI Facilities) which LSI
Personnel will be allowed to use,  



 

1  including the area in which the Retained Equipment is located, cafeteria,
restrooms, break rooms, hallways, elevators, and staircases providing ingress
and egress to the LSI Facilities, all automobile parking areas, driveways,
entrances and exits thereto and the walking trails and park area.

1.3 "Change in Control" means, with respect to a Party (or Purchaser), the
occurrence of any of the following events: (a) any consolidation or merger of
such Party (or Purchaser) with or into any other entity in which the holders
of such Partys (or Purchasers) outstanding shares immediately before such
consolidation or merger do not, immediately after such consolidation or
merger, retain stock representing a majority of the voting power of
the surviving entity or stock representing a majority of the voting power of
an entity that wholly owns, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity; (b)
the sale, transfer, or assignment of securities of such Party (or Purchaser)
representing a majority of the voting power of all of such Partys (or
Purchasers) outstanding voting securities to an acquiring party or group, in
a single transaction or a series of related transactions; or (c) the sale of
all or substantially all of such Partys (or Purchasers) assets. In
addition, in the case of SCI, a "Change in Control" also means and includes
any transaction or series of transactions as a result of which Purchaser no
longer has the power or authority to control and direct the business or
affairs of SCI.

1.4 "LSI Facilities" means the portion of the Gresham Facilities within which
LSI and its employees and contractors will have the exclusive right to occupy
and use, as such are designated as "LSI Lease Area" on page 4 of 5 of Exhibit
A (subject to SCIs rights of access for maintenance purposes).

1.5 "LSI Personnel" means the employees and contractors of LSI who have access
to the LSI Facilities. LSI Personnel includes the Retained Employees and any
other employees or contractors of LSI, whether they are persons who normally
occupy the LSI Facilities or are visitors thereto.

1.6 "SCI Personnel" means the employees and contractors of SCI who have access
to the Gresham Facilities.

2\. ACCESS AND SERVICES

grants to LSI the exclusive right for LSI and the LSI Personnel to access and
use the LSI Facilities and the non-exclusive right for LSI and the LSI
Personnel to access and use the Authorized Areas. LSI Personnel will have the
same level of access to the Authorized Areas as the SCI Personnel. Access to
the LSI Facilities will be separate from access to the rest of the
Gresham Facilities. SCI will make all commercially reasonable efforts to
secure and maintain the security of the LSI Facilities against unauthorized
access by SCI Personnel and third parties. SCI Personnel will not have access
to the LSI Facilities except as necessary for SCI to fulfill its obligations
and exercise its rights under this Agreement. SCI will provide LSI with the
ability to issue [ _ _] security access cards or similar devices to be
provided to LSI Personnel security access cards or similar devices to enable
LSI Personnel access to the LSI Facilities and to the Authorized Areas and to
preclude access by unauthorized SCI Personnel. Any change to the portion of
the Gresham Facilities identified as the LSI Facilities will require the
written agreement of both Parties;  



 

2  provided, however, in the event that SCI intends to make any change to the
Authorized Area that could reasonably be expected to impact their use by
LSI Personnel, SCI will provide LSIs designated representative with
reasonable prior written notice.

2.2 Equipment. SCI acknowledges and agrees that LSI has the right to store,
access, and use the Retained Equipment at the Gresham Facilities and that SCI
will not, and will not permit the SCI Personnel or any third party to, access
or use the Retained Equipment without LSIs prior written consent. SCI will
be responsible for maintaining proper environmental conditions (e.g.,
temperature and humidity) for the Retained Equipment and for supplying
electricity, network connectivity, and other utilities necessary for LSI and
the LSI Personnel to access and use the Retained Equipment. LSI will be
responsible for maintenance of the Retained Equipment. SCI retains the right
to move the location of the Retained Equipment to a different location at
the Gresham Facilities upon sixty (60) days written notice to LSI, provided
that the new location has substantially similar use, storage and access. SCI
will bear all costs associated with any relocation of the Retained Equipment
and will not unreasonably disrupt LSIs operations in which the Retained
Equipment is used.

2.3 Services. SCI will make all commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
LSI all services and utilities related to the operation or use of the LSI
Facilities and the Authorized Areas that are provided to other similar
portions of the Gresham Facilities, including janitorial, security, waste
disposal, telephone, electricity, HVAC, water, building operations and
maintenance, property taxes, and other similar services and utilities
(collectively, the "Services"). The Services are further described in _Exhibit
C_. All long distance telephone charges resulting from LSIs usage will be
borne by LSI. At LSIs request, SCI will arrange for LSI to have a separate
switchboard or allocated capacity through the existing telephone system at the
Gresham Facilities. If LSI requests a separate switchboard, all costs
associated with the switchboard and the separation of the phone system will be
borne by LSI. SCI will use the same efforts to respond to LSIs reasonable
requests for Services as SCI uses to respond to similar requests by SCIs own
personnel at the Gresham Facilities. SCI will provide LSI with the contact
information necessary for LSI and the LSI Personnel to request Services during
and outside of SCIs normal business hours at the Gresham Facilities.

2.4 Policies. LSI will instruct the LSI Personnel to comply with SCIs
reasonable safety, security, environmental, clean room protocol and Gresham
Facilities protocol policies, including SCIs Code of Conduct, applicable to
the Gresham Facilities with respect to their use of the LSI Facilities and
Authorized Areas, provided that SCI informs LSI and the LSI Personnel of
these policies and of any changes to these policies. LSI will ensure that the
LSI Personnel use reasonable care in their use of the LSI Facilities and
Authorized Areas and that such LSI employees do not disrupt the SCI business
operations at the Gresham Facilities. SCI will inform LSI of any serious or
persistent violation of the policies that requires LSI to take action to
correct and LSI agrees to promptly cooperate in resolving the issue. SCI
reserves the right to immediately bar from the Gresham Facilities any LSI
Personnel or LSI contractor that is creating a serious and immediate
disruption to the operations of the Facilities or to the safety and security
of other personnel.

2.5 Modifications. In no event shall LSI or LSI Personnel make any
improvements, modifications or changes to the Authorized Areas or
LSI Facilities without SCIs prior written  



 

3  consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, or to the Authorized
Areas; provided, however, the alterations that are made prior to the Closing
Date or to be made thereafter to the LSI Facilities for the purposes of
conforming the Gresham Facilities to this Agreement are acknowledged to be
acceptable to SCI.

2.6 Parkland Access for SCI. LSI will allow employees and contractors of SCI
and its Affiliates to use the walking, hiking, and jogging trails that run
from the Gresham Facilities Real Property (which is owned or leased by SCI)
onto the Excluded Land and the parkland area thereon to which such trails
connect ("Permitted Areas") (all such Permitted Areas being owned by LSI),
provided that LSI may at any time and at its sole discretion, with or without
prior notice, revoke or impose conditions upon its permission for employees of
SCI and its Affiliates to use such Permitted Areas. SCI will defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless LSI and its Subsidiaries, and their respective
directors, officers, employees, and agents, from and against any and all
claims, suits, actions, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), including any claims, suits, or

("SCI"), and (c) LSI Logic Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its
principal place of business at 1621 Barber Lane, Milpitas, CA 95035 ("LSI").
In this Agreement, LSI, SCI, and ON are referred to collectively as the

RECITALS

A. SCI and LSI are parties to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated April [__],
2006 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which LSI has agreed to
cause its and its subsidiaries right, title, and interest in and to certain
assets associated with LSIs semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in
Gresham, Oregon to be sold and transferred to SCI and SCI has agreed to
acquire the same from LSI and its subsidiaries.

B. As part of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement,

AGREEMENT

The Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

of this Agreement, directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is

other governing body (or, if there are no such interests, more than 50% of
the equity interests), but only as long as such Person meets these
requirements; _provided, however,_ that in the case of SCI and ON, the term
"Affiliate" excludes TPG Partners II, L.P., its parallel funds, their general
partners and their other portfolio companies (collectively, "TPG"), and any
other    person or entity that would be an "Affiliate" pursuant to the foregoing
definition solely as a result of its ownership by, or its
control relationship with, TPG.

1.2 "Change in Control" means, with respect to a Party, the occurrence of any
of the following events: (a) any consolidation or merger of such Party with
or into any other entity in which the holders of such Partys outstanding
shares immediately before such consolidation or merger do not, immediately
after such consolidation or merger, retain stock representing a majority of
the voting power of the surviving entity or stock representing a majority of
the voting power of an entity that wholly owns, directly or indirectly, the
surviving entity; (b) the sale, transfer, or assignment of securities of such
Party representing a majority of the voting power of all of such partys
outstanding voting securities to an acquiring party or group, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions; or (c) the sale of all or
substantially all of such Partys assets to an acquiring party or group.

1.3 "Confidential Information" means, subject to Section 2.4, any
confidential or proprietary information of one Party or any of its Affiliates
(or any third party to which one Party or any of its Affiliates owes a duty of
confidentiality), whether in written, oral, graphic, electronic, or other
form (including notes, reports, analyses, compilations, studies, drawings,
designs, software code, cost and other unpublished financial information,
customer and supplier lists, employee names and records, product roadmaps,
business plans, pricing and marketing data, forecasts, and projections), which
information is disclosed, made available, or accessible to or observed by the
other Party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in connection with
the Contemplated Transactions or pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement, and (a)
is marked or identified at the time of disclosure or observation as being
"Confidential" or "Proprietary," (b) would be understood by a reasonable
person to be confidential or proprietary in nature, or (c) is expressly
identified as "Confidential Information" of a Party in any Ancillary
Agreement.

1.4 "Disclosing Party" means the Party whose Confidential Information is
disclosed or made available to or accessible or observed by another Party or
any Affiliates or Representatives of another Party.

1.5 "LSI Proprietary Business Information" means all proprietary business
information of LSI or any of its Affiliates or any of their customers that is
(a) located at the Gresham Facility on the Closing Date or otherwise disclosed
or made available to or accessible or observed by ON or SCI or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives and (b) not necessary for ON, SCI, or any of
their Affiliates to exercise rights or fulfill obligations under any Ancillary
Agreement.

1.6 "Receiving Party" means the Party that receives, has access to, or
observes (or any of whose Affiliates or Representatives receives, has access
to, or observes) Confidential Information of another Party.

1.7 "Representative" of a Party means a director, officer, employee, agent,
attorney, or advisor of such Party or any of its Affiliates (in each instance,
solely in his or her capacity as such).



 

2 1.8 "Transferred Confidential Information" means the Fab Intellectual Property
and Fab Information as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement. The
Transferred Confidential Information will be Confidential Information of ON.

2. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS

2.1 Limitations on Use and Disclosure. The Receiving Party will not, and will
not allow any of its Affiliates or Representatives to, use, disclose, provide,
or make available to any third party any Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party except (a) as necessary to consummate any of the
Contemplated Transactions or as expressly permitted under any Ancillary
Agreement or any other written agreement between the Receiving Party and the
Disclosing Party; (b) for disclosures to the Receiving Partys Representatives
to the extent necessary (i) to operate the Gresham Facilities (but subject to
any express limitations or restrictions on the use or disclosure of such
Confidential Information set forth in an Ancillary Agreement or any other
written agreement between the Receiving Party and the Disclosing Party) or
(ii) for the Receiving Party to exercise its rights or perform its obligations
under any Ancillary Agreement or any other written agreement between the
Parties (but subject to any express limitations or restrictions on the use or
disclosure of such Confidential Information set forth in such Ancillary
Agreement or such other written agreement); or (c) in the course of legal
proceedings to establish the Receiving Partys rights or obligations
(provided that the Receiving Party has notified the Disclosing Party thereof
and used all reasonable efforts to obtain a protective order or otherwise
lawfully contest or seek to limit the scope of the disclosure). Nothing in
this Section 2.1 will permit ON, SCI, or any of their Affiliates or
Representatives to use or disclose any LSI Proprietary Business Information.

2.2 LSI Proprietary Business Information. ON, SCI, and their Representatives
will have no right under or as a result of this Agreement, or except as may be
expressly provided in another Ancillary Agreement, as a result of
the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, to use, disclose, or obtain any LSI Proprietary Business
Information. To the extent and for as long as any LSI Proprietary Business
Information (other than LSI Proprietary Business Information that is not
Confidential Information of LSI) is accessible or controlled by ON, SCI, or
any of their Representatives, ON and SCI will protect such LSI Proprietary
Business Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same
manner as ON and SCI protect their own confidential information of a similar
nature, and in no event with less than reasonable care. Whenever ON or SCI or
any of their Representatives discover or otherwise obtain any LSI Proprietary
Business Information, ON or SCI will promptly notify LSI and thereafter will,
at LSIs request or direction, return to LSI or destroy (or in the case of
electronic files permanently erase) all documents, materials, and
electronic files containing such LSI Proprietary Business Information.

2.3 Protection Against Unauthorized Use or Disclosure. The Receiving Party
will limit access to the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information to those
of the Receiving Partys Representatives who have a need to know, who are
subject to confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those set
forth herein, and who have been informed of the confidential nature of such
information. In addition, the Receiving Party will protect the Disclosing
Partys Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure
in the same manner as the Receiving Party protects its own confidential
information of a similar nature, and in no event  



 

3  with less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party will be liable to the
Disclosing Party for any action or omission on the part of any Affiliate
or Representative of the Receiving Party that would constitute a breach of
this Agreement by the Receiving Party if the Receiving Party itself had
committed such action or omission.

2.4 General Exceptions. The term "Confidential Information" does not include
information that (i) is or becomes available to the public, other than as a
result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives in breach of this Agreement; (ii) was or is provided to the
Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates or Representatives on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives, provided that the source of such information
was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party or any
of its Affiliates with respect to such information or otherwise prohibited
from providing the information to the Receiving Party or such Affiliate or
Representative of the Receiving Party by a contractual, legal, or fiduciary
obligation; or (iii) the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives independently develops without reference to Confidential
Information or any derivative thereof. In the case of LSI as the Receiving
Party, the exception in clause (ii) in this Section 2.4 will apply to
Transferred Confidential Information only to the extent such Transferred
Confidential Information is provided to LSI or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives after the Closing Date.

2.5 Exception for Required Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, if the Receiving Party or any Affiliate
or Representative of the Receiving Party is required by any Legal Requirement
or a Governmental Order to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving
Party will provide the Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such required
disclosure so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other
appropriate remedy. If the Disclosing Party determines to seek such a
protective order or other remedy, the Receiving Party will (and will cause its
Affiliates and Representatives to) cooperate with the Disclosing Party in
seeking such protective order or other remedy. If such protective order or
other remedy is not obtained and disclosure of Confidential Information is
required, the Receiving Party or such Affiliate or Representative of the
Receiving Party, as the case may be, (i) may, without liability hereunder,
furnish that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information
which, in the written opinion of counsel to the Receiving Party or the
Affiliate or Representative of the Receiving Party, as the case may be, the
Receiving Party or such Affiliate or Representative of the Receiving Party is
legally required to disclose and (ii) will exercise reasonable efforts to have
confidential treatment accorded any Confidential Information so furnished.

2.6 Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. At the request
and direction of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will (and will
cause its Affiliates to) promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy
(or in the case of electronic files, permanently erase) all documents,
materials, and electronic files containing Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party, unless the Receiving Party (or any of its Affiliates) has a
right or need to use such Confidential Information to exercise its rights or
fulfill its obligations under an Ancillary Agreement or any other written
agreement between the Disclosing Party and the Receiving Party. In addition,
even if not requested by the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party will (and
will cause its Affiliates to) promptly return or destroy, as described in
this Section 2.6, any Confidential Information that is no longer required by
the Receiving Party (or any of its  



 

4  Affiliates) to exercise its rights or fulfill its obligations under any
Ancillary Agreement or any other written agreement with the Disclosing
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except with respect to the LSI
Proprietary Business Information, the Receiving Party may retain one archival
copy of documents, materials, and files containing Confidential Information
solely for evidentiary purposes. 

2.7 Residuals. Subject to any express restrictions on the use of intellectual
property or proprietary rights in other Ancillary Agreements, the Receiving
Party will be free to use the residuals of any Confidential Information in any
manner without being required to pay any fee, royalty, or other consideration
to the Disclosing Party, subject only to its obligations with respect to
disclosure of such Confidential Information set forth herein. The term
"residuals" means any information that is retained in the unaided memories of
Representatives of the Receiving Party who have had access to
the Confidential Information.

3\. DISCLAIMERS. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any
Party (or any of its Affiliates or Representatives) any right or license
under any intellectual property rights of another Party. Except as may be
expressly provided otherwise in an Ancillary Agreement, all Confidential
Information is furnished "AS IS." No Party makes any representation or
warranty in this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
as creating any implied representation or warranty, including any
representation or warranty concerning accuracy or completeness, with respect
to any Confidential Information provided to another Party. The foregoing does
not in any way limit, impair, or otherwise affect any representations or
warranties made in the Asset Purchase Agreement, any other Ancillary
Agreement, or any other written agreement between the Parties.

4\. REMEDIES

4.1 Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges that money damages
would be both incalculable and an insufficient remedy for any breach of this
Agreement by the Receiving Party and that any such breach would cause the
Disclosing Party irreparable harm. Accordingly, the Receiving Party also
agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement,
the Disclosing Party, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity
it may have, will be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief
and specific performance, without the requirement of posting a bond or other
security.

4.2 No Liability Limitations. No disclaimers or limitations of liability in
any of the other Ancillary Agreements will apply to breaches of
this Agreement.

5\. GENERAL PROVISIONS

5.1 Assignment. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, no
Party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under
this Agreement (whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by way of merger, or
otherwise) to any third party without the prior written consent of the other
Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may assign this entire
Agreement to any of its Affiliates or to any successor in the event of a
Change in Control of such Party, provided that such Affiliate or successor
agrees in writing to be bound by this Agreement and to assume all of the
assigning Partys obligations under this Agreement. Any  



 

5  attempted assignment of rights or delegation of obligations under this
Agreement in breach or violation of this Section 5.1 will be null and void. 

5.2 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to either Party under this Agreement must be in writing and will be
deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service, or by facsimile) to
the address or facsimile telephone number set forth beneath the name of such
Party below (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number as such
Party will have specified in a written notice given to the other Party):

5.7 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application of

valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

5.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement, and the
other Ancillary Agreements set forth the entire understanding of the Parties
and supersede all  



 

6  other agreements and understandings between the Parties relating to the

  Preliminary Title Report |  | Order No. 06-000759m 
 

NOTE: It is our policy in Oregon to identify a reduced title insurance charge
on Schedule A when it appears to us that your transaction qualifies for a
reduced charge. The reduction usually is computed as a percentage of the
Companys basic rate. If a reduced charge appears on Schedule A, it is one of
the following:



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
   _Short Term Rate_ : |  | A discount of up to 20% applies when there
has been title insurance on the property within the previous three years. 
   | 
   _Builder-Developer Rate_ : |  | A discount of 35% may apply when a
party to the transaction is a builder or developer and the property is
residential. 
   | 
   _Lender Post-Foreclosure Rate_ : |  | A discount of 35% may apply
when a seller acquired the property through foreclosure. 
   | 
   _Contract Fulfillment Rate_ : |  | A discount of up to 50% may apply
to an owners policy issued upon fulfillment of a previously insured land sale
contract. 
   | 
   _Post-Construction Permanent Loan Rate_ : |  | A discount of up to
75% may apply to a loan policy for a permanent mortgage when it refinances a
previously insured construction loan. 
   | 
   _Simultaneous Issue Rate_ : |  | A special rate may apply when two or
more policies are issued simultaneously, such as a loan policy with an owners
policy or two loan policies. 
 

IF YOU THINK A REDUCED RATE APPLIES TO YOUR TRANSACTION BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR
ON SCHEDULE A, PLEASE INFORM YOUR ESCROW OFFICER OR TITLE OFFICER.

You may contact your escrow officer or title officer at the phone number,
email address or mailing address shown on this report.
