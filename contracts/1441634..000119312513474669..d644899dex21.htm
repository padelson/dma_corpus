their respective successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. On
or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent
resignations of the directors of the Company to be effective as of the
Effective Time, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

consider or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in
law or any other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or
confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title
or interest in, to or under any of the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company or (ii) otherwise carry out the

be deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law and to take all acts necessary, proper or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm title to and possession of such property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation are authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take any
and all such action.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their
respective stockholders, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Cancelled
Shares and except for any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and
extinguished and automatically converted into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $11.15 (such amount of cash
hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the
holder thereof, without interest, in accordance with Section 3.02.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, all of the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 3
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and

_Certificate_ ") and each holder of a non-certificated share of Company
Common Stock represented by book-entry (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time previously representing
any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such securities, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest.

 

(c) Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company shall
occur by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon
with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or stock dividend
thereon.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned
directly by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or
held in treasury of the Company (in each case, other than any such Company
Common Stock held on behalf of third parties) (the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and
shall cease to exist and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

 

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding

fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

 



19 Section 3.02 Election Procedures; Surrender and Payment.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a reputable bank or trust
company to act as Paying Agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
payment of (i) the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
by a Certificate and each Book Entry Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, in each case, other than the Cancelled Shares and except
for any Dissenting Shares and (ii) the Option Consideration and RSU
Consideration payable by the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 3.05. Prior to
the Effective Time, Ultimate Parent shall cause Parent to, and Parent shall,
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration, RSU Consideration and
Option Consideration required to be paid by the Paying Agent in accordance
with this Agreement (such cash shall be referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to make the payments in connection with the Merger Consideration contemplated
by Section 3.01 or the Option Consideration or RSU Consideration contemplated
by Section 3.05, Ultimate Parent shall cause Parent to, and Parent shall,
promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional funds with the Paying
Agent in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to
make such payment. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued
pursuant to Section 3.01 and the Option Consideration and RSU Consideration
contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 3.05 out of the Exchange Fund.
The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time,
Parent will cause the Paying Agent to send to each holder of record of shares
of Company Common Stock (other than the Cancelled Shares and except for any
Dissenting Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent)
in such form as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, for use in
effecting delivery of shares of Company Common Stock to the Paying Agent, and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(c) Upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of Certificates (or effective
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions or (ii) compliance with the
reasonable procedures established by the Paying Agent for delivery of Book-
Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest
shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this Article 3.

 

(d) If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be
a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer Taxes required by reason of the

 



20  making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
the surrendered Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion of
the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer Taxes required as a
result of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common
Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Applicable Law.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article 3.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Cashed Out Compensatory Awards
after the date which is one year following the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent upon demand. Any holder of shares of Company Common Stock
who has not exchanged his shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.02 and any holder of a Cashed
Out Compensatory Award who has not received the Option Consideration and
RSU Consideration in accordance with Section 3.05 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration, RSU
Consideration or Option Consideration in respect of such holders shares of
Company Common Stock or Cashed Out Compensatory Award. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Ultimate Parent, Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or
Cashed Out Compensatory Awards for any Merger Consideration, RSU
Consideration or Option Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any Merger
Consideration, RSU Consideration or Option Consideration remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of Company Common Stock or holders of Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become property of Parent free and
clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Section 3.02 to pay for shares for which appraisal rights
shall have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

(h) All Merger Consideration, RSU Consideration or Option Consideration
issued and paid upon conversion of the Company Common Stock or the Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards, respectively, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common Stock or Cashed
Out Compensatory Awards, as the case may be.

 



21 Section 3.03 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
as contemplated by this Article 3.

 

Section 3.04 Withholding Rights. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or
cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment pursuant to the Code or under any provision of federal, state, local
or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Ultimate Parent, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may
be, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.05 Treatment of Company Compensatory Awards.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each In-the-Money Company Option that is
outstanding and vested (including any unvested Company Options that are not
assumed pursuant to Section 3.05(b) and vest in connection with the
Transaction contemplated by this Agreement by virtue of such non-assumption
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan) as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time other than Company Options set forth in Section
3.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (" _Cashed Out Company Options_ ")
shall be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (i) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration less the exercise price per share
of such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that any
Cashed Out Company Option is subject to Section 409A of the Code, as jointly
determined by Parent and the Company, the payment of the amount of cash with
respect thereto shall be delayed to the extent necessary to comply with
Section 409A of the Code. Each holder of an outstanding In-the-Money Company
Option shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the cancellation thereof
the Option Consideration with respect to each share of Company Common Stock
subject to such outstanding In-the-Money Company Option and the Company shall
cause such payment to be made to the holder of such Company Option, if a
current or former employee of the Company, through the payroll system of the
Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or former employee of the Company,
through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as soon as practicable
following the Closing Date (and, in the case of current or former employees of
the Company, in no event later than the next regularly scheduled payroll run
of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date).

 



22 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is either outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time and is held by an Acquired
Company Employee or Acquired Company Service Provider or set forth in Section
3.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be assumed by Ultimate Parent
and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option denominated
in Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares having the same terms and conditions as the
Company Option (each, an " _Assumed Option_ "), except that (i) each such
Assumed Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance
with its terms) for that number of whole Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares equal
to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) a fraction (such ratio, the " _Exchange
Ratio_ "), the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the
denominator of which is the volume weighted average price for an Ultimate
Parent Ordinary Share for the five trading days immediately prior to (and
excluding) the Closing Date as reported by Bloomberg, L.P., and rounding such
product down to the nearest whole number of Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares,
(ii) the per share exercise price for the Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares
issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option will be equal to the quotient
determined by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such quotient up to the
nearest whole cent and (iii) all references to the " _Company_ " in the
applicable Company Stock Plans and the stock option agreements will be
references to Ultimate Parent. The Company will not take any action to
accelerate the vesting of any Company Options (other than to implement any
existing agreements or arrangements for such acceleration in effect as of the
date of this Agreement). As soon as reasonably practicable, Ultimate Parent
will use reasonable best efforts to issue to each Person who holds an Assumed
Option a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Company Option
by Ultimate Parent.

(c) All Company Options which are not In-the-Money Company Options or Assumed
Options shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
exchange for no consideration. In no event shall the Company Options described
in this Section 3.05(c) be assumed by Ultimate Parent.

 

(d) At the Effective Time each Company RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and is held by an Acquired Company Employee or
Acquired Company Service Provider shall be assumed by Ultimate Parent and
converted automatically at the Effective Time into a restricted stock unit
denominated in Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares having the same terms and
conditions as the Company RSU (each, an " _Assumed RSU_ "), except that (i)
each such Company RSU will entitle the holder, upon settlement, to that number
of whole Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares equal to the product of (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable with regard to
such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (B)
the Exchange Ratio, and rounding such product down to the nearest whole number
of Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares, (ii) all references to the "Company" in
the applicable Company Stock Plans and the Company RSU agreements will be
references to Ultimate Parent and (iii) the

 



23  performance-based vesting criteria, if any, shall be deemed met at the
Effective Time with respect to such Company RSU at a level that would result
in the payout of a Target Award (as defined in the applicable award agreement
relating to such Company RSU as in effect on the date of this Agreement). The
Company will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any Company RSU
(other than to implement any existing agreements or arrangements for such
acceleration in effect as of the date of this Agreement). As soon as
reasonably practicable, Ultimate Parent will issue to each Person who holds an
assumed Company RSU a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of
such Company RSU by Ultimate Parent.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, each Company RSU that is not an Assumed RSU
(" _Cashed Out Company RSUs_ " and together with Cashed Out Company Options, "
_Cashed Out Compensatory Awards_ ") shall vest in full and be cancelled
immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration
(the " _RSU Consideration_ "). In the event that any Cashed Out Company RSU is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, as jointly determined by Parent and the
Company, the payment of the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be
delayed to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each
holder of an outstanding Cashed Out Company RSU shall be entitled to receive
in exchange for the cancellation thereof the RSU Consideration with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock subject to such outstanding Company RSU
and the Company shall cause such payment to be made to the holder of such
Company RSU, if a current or former employee of the Company, through the
payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or, if not a current or former
employee of the Company, through the Paying Agent, in each case, payable as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date (and, in the case of
current or former employees of the Company, in no event later than the next
regularly scheduled payroll run of the Surviving Corporation following the
Closing Date).

 

(f) At the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock issued in
connection with a Company Compensatory Award, which share is then subject to
vesting or other lapse restrictions (collectively, the " _Company Restricted
Stock_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a
cash payment, from Ultimate Parent, upon vesting, equal to the Merger
Consideration (the " _Company Restricted Cash_ "). Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, the Company Restricted Cash shall have the same terms
and conditions as the Company Restricted Stock.

(g) Not less than 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send
a written notice in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent to each holder of
an outstanding Company Option or Company RSU that shall inform such holder of
the treatment of the Company Options and Company RSUs provided in this Section
3.05.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.05 or otherwise in this
Agreement to the contrary, the conversion of Company Options and Company RSUs
provided for in this Section 3.05 shall be effected in a manner consistent
with Section 409A of the Code.

 



24 (i) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or
any participant in any Company Stock Plan, or other Company Employee Plan or
employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any employment agreement
shall have any right hereunder to acquire any capital stock or other equity
interests (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 3.06 Dissenting Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect
to each share of Company Common Stock as to which the holder thereof shall
have (i) not voted in favor of the Merger, (ii) properly complied with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL as to appraisal rights or (iii) not
effectively withdrawn or lost its rights to appraisal (each, a " _Dissenting
Share_ "), if any, such holder shall be entitled to payment, solely from the
Surviving Corporation, of the appraisal value of the Dissenting Shares to the
extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) if any holder of Dissenting
Shares, under the circumstances permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL,
affirmatively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise)
the right to dissent or its right for appraisal of such Dissenting Shares, (y)
if any holder of Dissenting Shares fails to establish his entitlement to
appraisal rights as provided in the DGCL or (z) if any holder of
Dissenting Shares takes or fails to take any action the consequence of which
is that such holder is not entitled to payment for his shares under the DGCL,
such holder or holders (as the case may be) shall forfeit the right to
appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock and such shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Dissenting Shares, and each
such share of Company Common Stock shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest
thereon, the Merger Consideration.

 

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock and
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands for appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal for Dissenting Shares,
(ii) offer to settle any such demands, (iii) waive any failure to timely
deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance with the DGCL or (iv)
agree to do any of the foregoing.

Company of this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the

prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Debt Financing. As
of the date hereof, neither Ultimate Parent nor Parent has any reason to
believe that it or any other party thereto will be unable to satisfy on a
timely basis any term of the Debt Commitment Letters. There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing,
other than the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. The only
conditions precedent related to the funding of the Debt Financing on the
Closing Date that will be included in the Debt Financing Documents shall be
the conditions set forth in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. As
of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations
and warranties set forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company of
its obligations hereunder, neither Ultimate Parent nor Parent has any reason
to believe that (a) any of the conditions set forth in or contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters will not be satisfied or (b) the Debt Financing will
not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that a breach of this
representation and warranty shall not result in the failure of a condition
precedent to the Companys obligations under this Agreement, if
(notwithstanding such breach) Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub are
willing and able to consummate the Merger on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Parents and Ultimate Parents
obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding Parents or
any of its Affiliates obtaining funds to consummate the Merger.

Section 6.02 Stockholder Approval; Notice.

 

(a) The Company shall take all action in accordance with Applicable Law and
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company to establish a
record date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the adoption of this Agreement (the
" _Company Stockholder Meeting_ "). The Company Stockholder Meeting shall be
held on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent as promptly
as reasonably practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under
Applicable Law) the Original Date shall be within 45 days following the date
on which the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC, for the purpose of
obtaining the Required Company Stockholder Approval. The Company shall (i)
ensure that the Company Stockholder Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held
and conducted, and that all Persons solicited in connection with the Company
Stockholder Meeting are solicited, in compliance with all Applicable Law and
(ii) subject to and without limiting the rights of the Company Board of
Directors to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to Section
6.03(f),

 



52  use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to obtain the Required Company
Stockholder Approval, including such actions as are required by Applicable
Law. The adoption of this Agreement, the adjournment of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, as necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there are
insufficient votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement, and the
advisory vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act shall be the
only matters which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Companys
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting unless otherwise approved in
writing by Parent. 

(b) The Company shall consult with Parent regarding the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , if on
the date for which the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled (the "
_Original Date_ "), the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of shares for the Required Company Stockholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present, Parent shall have the right to require
the Company, and the Company shall have the right, to postpone or adjourn the
Company Stockholder Meeting to a date which shall not be more than 30 days
after the Original Date. If the Company continues not to receive proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares for the Required Company
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company may, in
its sole discretion, make one or more successive postponements or adjournments
of the Company Stockholder Meeting as long as the date of the Company
Stockholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date beyond the End
Date in reliance on this subsection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company may postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i)
the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting by Applicable Law or (ii) the Company Board of Directors or any
authorized committee thereof shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate
to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting in order to give
Company Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure
that the Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made available
to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the
SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any Change of Board
Recommendation).

 

(c) Subject to Section 6.03: (i) the Proxy Statement shall include the Company
Board Recommendation and (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be
withdrawn, modified or qualified in any manner adverse to Parent, and no
resolution by the Company Board of Directors or any committee thereof to
withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse
to Parent shall be adopted or proposed (any of the foregoing a " _Change of
Board Recommendation_ ").

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 6.02 shall prohibit the Company Board
of Directors from disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosure other than a "stop, look
and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition
Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Companys recommendation to the
stockholders of the Company in favor of the adoption of the Agreement,
together with a factual description of

 



53  events or actions leading up to such disclosure that have been taken by the
Company and that are permitted under Section 6.03 or actions taken or notices
delivered to Ultimate Parent or Parent by the Company that are required by
Section 6.03 shall, in each case, be deemed to be a Change of Board
Recommendation hereunder, including for purposes of Section 9.01(f).

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees that,
unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, (i) the
Companys obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting shall not be affected by the withdrawal, amendment
or modification of the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) the Companys
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).
Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.01, the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the
Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior
to the vote of the Companys stockholders with respect to the adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 

Section 6.03 No Solicitation.

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Representatives and each of
the other Acquired Companies (and each of their respective Representatives)
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Ultimate
Parent, Parent and their Representatives) conducted on or prior to the date of
this Agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly
after the date of this Agreement instruct each Person that has in the twelve
months prior to the date of this Agreement executed a confidentiality
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the
Company to promptly return or destroy, in accordance with the terms of such
confidentiality agreement, all information, documents and materials relating
to the Acquisition Proposal or to the Acquired Companies and their businesses
previously furnished by or on behalf of the Acquired Companies or any of their
respective Representatives to such Person or such Persons Representatives.
Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall provide
Parent with a certificate signed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer that
shall certify the Companys compliance with this Section 6.03(a).

 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.03, from the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01, the Company shall not, and shall
cause each of its Representatives and each of the other Acquired Companies
(and each of their respective Representatives) not to, directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly encourage,
facilitate, induce or support, or knowingly take any action to solicit,
initiate, seek or knowingly encourage, facilitate, induce or support any
announcement, communication, inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or
offer that constitutes or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person (other than Ultimate Parent, Parent and
their Representatives); (ii) enter into, participate in, maintain or continue
any discussions or negotiations relating to, any Acquisition Proposal with any
Person (other than Ultimate Parent, Parent and their Representatives), other
than solely to state that the Acquired Companies and their Representatives
are prohibited hereunder from engaging in any such discussions or
negotiations; (iii) furnish to any Person

 



54  (other than Ultimate Parent, Parent and their Representatives) any non-
public information that could reasonably be expected to be used for the
purposes of formulating any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or
offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal from a Person (other than any
information disclosed in the ordinary course consistent with past practices
and not known by the Company to be used for the purposes of formulating
any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer relating to an
Acquisition Proposal); (iv) accept any Acquisition Proposal or enter into any
agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(d)) with any
Person (other than Ultimate Parent, Parent and their Representatives); or (v)
submit any Acquisition Proposal or any matter related thereto to the vote of
the stockholders of the Company.

(c) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) provide Parent with:
a copy (if in writing) or written summary of material terms (if oral, which
written summary may be delivered by email) of any expression of interest,
proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal (including any material
modification thereto, which shall include any communications as to the
proposed amount or form of consideration, financing terms, if any,
and closing conditions), or a copy (if in writing) or written summary (if
oral, which written summary may be delivered by email) of any request for non-
public information that could reasonably be expected to be used for the
purposes of formulating any inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or
offer relating to an Acquisition Proposal from a Person (other than any
information disclosed in the ordinary course consistent with past practices
and not known by the Company to be used for the purposes of formulating any
inquiry, expression of interest, proposal or offer relating to an Acquisition
Proposal), that is received by any Acquired Company or any Representative of
any Acquired Company from any Person (other than Parent), including in
such description the identity of the Person from which such inquiry,
expression of interest, proposal, offer or request for information was
received (the " _Other Interested Party_ "). Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent
orally and in writing (which may be by email) if the Company determines to
begin providing information or to engage in discussions or negotiations
concerning an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Section 6.03(d).

(d) Notwithstanding Section 6.03(b), if at any time prior to the adoption of
this Agreement by the Required Company Stockholder Approval: (i) the Company
has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party; (ii)
the Company has not materially breached this Section 6.03; (iii) the Company
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal; and (iv)
after consultation with its outside counsel, the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith that such action is necessary to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL, then the
Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the Acquired Companies to
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that the Company (x) shall not, and shall
not allow any of its Representatives or any other Acquired Company or any of
its Representatives to, disclose any information to such Person without first
entering into a confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on
the use and disclosure of all

 



55  nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such Person by or on
behalf of any of the Acquired Companies and containing "standstill" provisions
no less favorable to the Company than the "standstill" provisions contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) shall promptly provide to Parent any
information concerning the Acquired Companies provided to such other Person
which was not previously provided to Parent.

(e) The Company shall not, and shall cause each other Acquired Company not to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which any Acquired
Company is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause each other Acquired
Company to, enforce the provisions of each such agreement.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Required Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Change of
Board Recommendation for a reason unrelated to an Acquisition Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any Change of Board Recommendation proposed
to be made in relation to an Acquisition Proposal may only be made pursuant
to and in accordance with the terms of Section 6.03(g)) if the Company Board
of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel, that, in light of an Intervening Event and taking into account the
results of any negotiations with Parent as contemplated by clause (ii) below
and any offer from Parent contemplated by clause (iii) below, that such action
is necessary to comply with fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board of
Directors to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board of Directors may not withdraw, modify or
amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Ultimate Parent
or Parent pursuant to the foregoing unless:

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_ "), of
the Companys intention to make a Change of Board Recommendation (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice and any amendment or update
thereto and the determination to so deliver such notice, update or amendment
shall not, by itself, constitute a Change of Board Recommendation or otherwise
give rise to a Triggering Event), which notice shall specify the Company
Board of Directors reason for proposing to effect such Change of Board
Recommendation;

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation, the Company
shall, and shall cause the Company Representatives to, during the Intervening
Event Notice Period negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
this Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for the Company
Board of Directors to effect such Change of Board Recommendation; and

 

(iii) Parent shall not have, within the aforementioned four Business Day
period, made a written, binding and irrevocable (through the expiration of
such period) offer to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
the Company Board of Directors has in good faith determined (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor)
would obviate the need for the Company Board of Directors to effect such
Change of Board Recommendation.

 



56 (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Parent (including pursuant to clause (ii) below), the Company Board
of Directors may at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
Required Company Stockholder Approval, if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
action is necessary to comply with fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board
of Directors to the stockholders of the Company under the DGCL, (y) effect
a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal or
(z) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z), and any
purported termination pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) shall be void and
of no force or effect, unless the Company complies with the provisions of
Section 9.01(g) and Section 9.03 in the time frames specified therein; and
provided, further that the Company Board of Directors may not withdraw, modify
or amend the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Ultimate
Parent or Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (z) unless (A) the Acquired
Companies shall not have materially breached this Section 6.03 and (B):

 

(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
four Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the Companys
intention to take any action permitted under clause (y) or (z) above with
respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the
party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously
provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party
making such Superior Proposal and all other material documents, including the
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (the "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "); and

 

(ii) prior to effecting such Change of Board Recommendation or terminating
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any revisions to the Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.03(g) with
respect to such new written notice, except that references to the four
Business Day period above shall be deemed references to a two Business Day
period.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, any actions taken by the Company in accordance
with this Section 6.03(g)(B) shall not be deemed to constitute a Change of
Board Recommendation.

 



57 (h) Neither the Company nor the Company Board of Directors shall take any
action to exempt any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates) from the provisions of "control share acquisitions"
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL or any other Anti-Takeover Law or
otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such
actions are taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.01(g).

 

(i) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.03 by any Representative of any of the Acquired Companies
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement (including this Section 6.03)
by the Company.

Section 6.04 Access to Information. Subject to Applicable Law, from the date
of this Agreement until the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and during
normal business hours, the Company shall and shall cause each other Acquired
Company to (a) give Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the
offices, properties, books and records of the Acquired Companies, (b) furnish
to Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Acquired Companies as such Persons may reasonably
request and (c) instruct the Representatives of the Acquired Companies to
cooperate with Parent in its investigation of the Acquired Companies;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Acquired Companies shall not be required to
provide access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company (after consultation with outside legal counsel), (i)
breach any agreement with any Person to which the Acquired Companies are
party or otherwise bound, (ii) constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or
other privilege held by any of the Acquired Companies, or (iii) otherwise
violate any Applicable Law (it being agreed that the Company shall give
notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such information or
documents pursuant to clauses (i) through (iii) above and thereafter the
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate (including by entering into a
joint defense or similar agreement) to cause such information to be provided
in a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable
privilege or protection or violate the applicable restriction). Any
investigation pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be conducted in such manner
as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the
Acquired Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not have
access to personnel records of the Acquired Companies relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information, the
disclosure of which would result in the violation of Applicable Law.

 

Section 6.05 Termination of Employee Plans. Unless Parent directs the Company
otherwise in writing no later than five Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, the Company Board of Directors (or the board of directors of the
applicable Acquired Company) shall adopt resolutions terminating, effective at
least one day prior to the Effective Time, any Employee Plan qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code and containing a Code Section 401(k) cash or
deferred arrangement (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ "). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall provide Parent with executed resolutions of its Board of
Directors (or the board of directors of the applicable Acquired Company)
authorizing such termination and amending any such 401(k) Plan commensurate
with its termination to the extent necessary to comply with all Applicable
Laws. The Company shall also take (and shall cause each applicable Acquired
Company to take) such other actions in furtherance of the termination of each
401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably require.

(c) Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to:

(i) cause the information supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of

made, not misleading; and

 

(ii) promptly inform the Company if at any time prior to the Effective Time,

Agreement_ ").

(b) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, each of Ultimate
Parent and the Company shall consult with the other and issue a joint press
release with respect to the execution of this Agreement. Thereafter, neither
the Company nor Ultimate Parent, nor any of their respective Subsidiaries,

previously publicly disclosed or made in accordance with this Agreement) with
respect to this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or any
Acquisition Proposal without the prior consent of the other party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (i)
as such press release or other announcement may be required by Applicable Law
or the applicable rules of a national securities exchange, in which case the
party required to issue the release or make the announcement shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such release or announcement in advance
of its issuance or (ii) in connection with a Change of Board Recommendation if
and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 7.04 Form S-8; ESPP; Assumption of Company Compensatory Awards.

 

(a) With respect to the Company Options and Company RSUs assumed pursuant to
Section 3.05, Ultimate Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 with respect to the Ultimate Parent
Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the assumed Company Compensatory
Awards promptly, but in any event no later than 15 Business Days, following
the Effective Time. The Company and its counsel shall cooperate with and
assist Ultimate Parent in the preparation of such registration statement. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover
any Cashed Out Compensatory Awards.

 

(b) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary to (i) cause any
offering period (or similar period during which shares may be purchased)
underway as of the date hereof under the Company ESPP to be terminated as of
the last day of the payroll period ending immediately preceding the Effective
Time (the " _Final Exercise Date_ "); (ii) make any pro-rata adjustments that
may be necessary to reflect the shortened offering period (or similar period),
but otherwise treat such shortened offering period (or similar period) as a
fully effective and completed offering period for all purposes under
the Company ESPP; (iii) cause each participants shares purchase right under
the Company ESPP (the " _Company ESPP Rights_ ") to be exercised as of the
Final Exercise Date; (iv) provide that no further offering periods
(or similar period during which shares may be purchased) shall commence under
the Company ESPP on or following the date of this Agreement; (v) provide that
no individual who is not participating in the Company ESPP as of the date
hereof may hereafter commence participation in the Company ESPP; and (vi)
terminate the Company ESPP as of the Final Exercise Date. Each outstanding
option under the Company ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on
such date for the purchase of Company Common Stock in

 



64  accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP. On the Final Exercise Date,
the funds credited as of such date under the Company ESPP within the
associated accumulated payroll withholding account for each participant under
the Company ESPP will be used to purchase shares in accordance with the terms
of the Company ESPP, and each share purchased thereunder immediately prior to
the Effective Time will be cancelled at the Effective Time and converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.01,
subject to withholding of applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.
No further Company ESPP Rights will be granted or exercised under the
Company ESPP after the Final Exercise Date (except for the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 7.04(b)). The Company shall
provide timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date and
termination of the Company ESPP in accordance with the Company ESPP.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or,
if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall
adopt such resolutions that are necessary for the assumption and conversion of
the Company Compensatory Awards and for the treatment of Cashed Out
Compensatory Awards as set forth in Section 3.05.

Section 7.05 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, subject to Applicable Law, all rights to
exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the
current and former directors and officers of any Acquired Company and his
heirs and personal representatives (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as
provided in the Companys or each of its Subsidiaries respective articles or
certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents) or in any agreement between any Acquired Company and
such DandO Indemnitee, shall survive the Transaction and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor such
obligations to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law. In addition,
for a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions
contained in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
organizational or governing documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six-year
period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of any DandO Indemnitee,
except as required by Applicable Law.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective 

 



65  Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current DandO Insurance carrier with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as
the Companys existing policies; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall the cost of such policies exceed 250% of the last annual premium paid
therefor prior to the Effective Time;  _provided_ _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Company
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not
exceeding such amount.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.05 shall survive the Closing and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO
Indemnitee, and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification
rights that any such DandO Indemnitee may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of any Acquired Company or any Contract or Applicable
Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations under this Section 7.05 shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee without the consent
of such DandO Indemnitee.

(d) In the event that the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries (or any of their respective successors or assigns) shall
consolidate or merge with any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or transfers
at least fifty percent (50%) of its properties and assets to any other
person, then in each case proper provision shall be made so that the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns,
if applicable), or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall,
unless such corporation or entity (or its successors or assigns, if
applicable) is otherwise bound by the obligations set forth in this Section
7.05 by Applicable Law, assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.05.

Section 7.06 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such actions as are required to cause the disposition of Company
Common Stock, Company Options, Company RSUs or other convertible securities in
connection with the Merger by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company
to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.07 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall (a) keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis regarding any stockholder litigation against the
Company or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and (b) give Parent the opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any such stockholder litigation.

Section 7.08 Financing.

 

(a) The Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to provide such
assistance (and to cause the other Acquired Companies, and to use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives, to provide
such assistance) with the Debt Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent.
Such assistance shall include, at the reasonable request of Parent, the
following: (i) participation in, and assistance with, the Marketing Efforts
related to

 



66  the Debt Financing; (ii) participation by senior management of the Acquired
Companies in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency
presentations and a reasonable number of meetings with rating agencies; (iii)
timely delivery to Parent and its Financing Sources of the Financing
Information by the times required in the Debt Commitment Letters; (iv)
participation by senior management of the Company in the negotiation of the
Debt Financing Documents (to the extent applicable) and the execution (to the
extent applicable) and delivery of the Financing Deliverables; provided, that
no obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the agreement,
pledge or grant pursuant to the Financing Deliverables shall be effective
until the Effective Time; (v) taking such actions as may be required to permit
any cash and marketable securities of the Acquired Companies available at
the Effective Time to be made available to finance, in part, the Merger on
the Closing Date; and (vi) using reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Debt Financing benefits from the existing lending relationships of the
Acquired Companies. The Company will provide to Parent and its Financing
Sources such information as may be necessary so that the Financing Information
and Marketing Material (in the case of Marketing Material, to the extent
related to the Acquired Companies and delivered to the Company) is complete
and correct in all material respects and does not and will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which such statements are made, not materially misleading. The Company
hereby consents to the use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in
connection with the Debt Financing in a manner customary for the arrangement
of financings similar to the Debt Financing; provided, that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to harm or disparage the Company
or any of its Affiliates or their reputation or goodwill. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar
fee or enter into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Debt Financing (or any alternative
financing) prior to the Effective Time and (ii) none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action that will conflict with
or violate the Companys or such Subsidiarys organizational documents or any
Applicable Laws or result in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be
expected to result in a violation or breach of or default under, any Contract
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Parent shall
reimburse the Company for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
and costs incurred in connection with the Companys or its Affiliates
obligations under this Section 7.08(a) promptly upon presentment of invoices
therefor. The Company, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives
(collectively, the " _7.08 Indemnitees_ ") shall be indemnified and held
harmless by Parent and Merger Sub for and against any and all losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation), interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered
or incurred by the 7.08 Indemnitees in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) and/or any information provided
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries expressly for use in connection
therewith, except to the extent such losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties arose out of or resulted
from the fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or intentional
misrepresentation of any 7.08 Indemnitee. Any information provided to Parent
or any other Person pursuant to this Section shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



67 (b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and to
consummate the Debt Financing on the Closing Date. Such actions shall include,
but not be limited to, the following: (i) maintaining in effect the Debt
Commitment Letters; _provided_  that Parent may replace or amend any Debt
Commitment Letter so long as such replacement or amendment would not adversely
impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to consummate
the Merger or the Debt Financing; (ii) participation by senior management of
Parent in, and assistance with, the preparation of rating agency presentations
and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) satisfying on a timely basis all
financing conditions that are within Parents or any of its Affiliates
control; (iv) negotiating, executing and delivering Debt Financing Documents
that reflect the terms contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (including any
"market flex" provisions related thereto) or on such other terms acceptable
to Parent and its Financing Sources; _provided_ that such other terms would
not adversely impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to
consummate the Merger or the Debt Financing; (v) drawing the full amount of
the Debt Financing, in the event that the conditions set forth in Section 8.01
and Section 8.02 and the financing conditions have been satisfied or, upon
funding would be satisfied; and (vi) using reasonable best efforts to enforce
the Debt Commitment Letters to cause any lender to provide such Debt
Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of any breach or
repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letters of which Parent or
its Affiliates becomes aware; provided that in no event will Parent be under
any obligation to disclose any information that is subject to any applicable
legal privileges (including the attorney-client privilege). Without limiting
Parents other obligations under this Section 7.08(b), if a Financing Failure
Event occurs, then Parent shall (x) promptly notify the Company of such
Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor, (y) use reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative financing sources on
terms (including structure, covenants and pricing) not materially less
beneficial to Parent than the unavailable financing (giving effect to any
"flex" provisions), in an amount sufficient to make the Closing Date Payments
and consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event, and (z) obtain, and when
obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that
provides for such alternative financing and the executed fee letter associated
therewith ( _provided_ , that the fee amounts and other economic terms set
forth in such fee letter, none of which could adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing, may be redacted). Neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign,
substitute or replace any of the Debt Commitment Letters or any Debt
Financing Document except for substitutions and replacements pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 7.09 Employee Matters.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Ultimate Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each Acquired
Company Employee with base salary, bonus opportunity, severance, health and
welfare benefits which are no less favorable than the base salary, bonus
opportunity, severance, health and welfare benefits each such Acquired Company
Employee is entitled or eligible to receive from any Acquired Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



68 (b) Ultimate Parent further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date,
Ultimate Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to the
extent permitted under such plans and under Applicable Law, to grant all of
the Acquired Company Employees credit for any service with such Acquired
Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting
purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance benefit
determinations under any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or
arrangement that may be established or that is maintained by Ultimate Parent
or the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the
Closing Date (but not benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan or frozen
benefit plan or vesting under any equity incentive plan) to the same extent
as such Acquired Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to
credit for such service under any similar plan in which such Acquired Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized
or credited to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits provided to the Acquired Company Employee, for purposes of
qualifying for subsidized early retirement benefits or to the extent that
such service was not recognized under any similar Employee Plan of the
Company. In addition, for purposes of each benefit plan of Ultimate Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing
Date (" _Parent Plans_ ") providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical, vision
and/or other health benefits to any Acquired Company Employee, Ultimate Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to (A) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements to the extent waived or satisfied by an Acquired Company Employee
and his or her covered dependents under any Employee Plan as of the Closing
Date and (B) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, cause any
deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid by any
Acquired Company Employee (or covered dependent thereof) during the portion
of the plan year in which such Acquired Company Employee participated in an
Employee Plan to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable Parent Plan in the applicable plan
year.

(c) As soon as administratively practicable following the Effective Time, all
participants in any 401(k) Plan of the Company shall become participants in
the comparable 401(k) Plan arrangement of Ultimate Parent or an Affiliate of
Ultimate Parent, and Ultimate Parent shall establish or designate a
comparable 401(k) Plan arrangement of Ultimate Parent or an Affiliate of
Ultimate Parent to receive any rollover distributions from such 401(k) Plans
of the Company, including rollover of any outstanding loans held by
participants of such plans.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as of the Effective
Time, Ultimate Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation, to
honor the change in control and severance agreements, arrangements and
policies set forth in Section 7.09 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each a

this Section 9.01(h) as a result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the
expiration of the Company Cure Period unless the Company is no longer
continuing to exercise reasonable best efforts to cure such inaccuracy or
breach;

 

(i) by the Company, if (i) any representation or warranty of Ultimate Parent,
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate or shall
have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the date of this Agreement
(as if made on such subsequent date) such that the condition set forth in
Section 8.03(a) would not be satisfied or (ii) the covenants or obligations
of Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall
have been breached in any material respect such that the condition set forth
in Section 8.03(b) would not be satisfied; _provided_ _, _ _however_ , that
if an inaccuracy or breach is curable by Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub
during the 30-day period after the Company notifies Parent in writing of the

result of such inaccuracy or breach prior to the expiration of the Parent Cure

Closing through the end of such three-day period.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01
(other than pursuant to Section 9.01(a)) shall give a notice of such
termination to the other party setting forth a brief description of the basis
on which such party is terminating this Agreement.

 

Section 9.02 Effect of Termination __. If this Agreement is terminated

has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement and (B)
within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement, the Company (1) enters
into a definitive agreement for the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal
and such Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of
whether such consummation occurs within the 12-month period) or (2)
consummates an Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Parent the Company Termination Fee concurrently with the
consummation of such transaction if such consummation takes place on a
Business Day, and on the next Business Day if the consummation takes place on
a day other than a Business Day (provided, however, that for purposes of this
Section 9.03(b)(i), the references to "15%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%");

 

(ii) (x) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(e) and (y) (A) an
Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company after the date hereof and
has not been withdrawn prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting

Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Company Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation of such
transaction if such consummation takes place on a Business Day, and on the

shall be deemed to be references to "50%"); or

 

(iii) by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 9.01(g), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent
the Company Termination Fee concurrently with such termination if the

termination takes place on a day other than a Business Day.

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.01(j), then Parent shall, or Ultimate Parent shall cause Parent to,

Fee.

 



75 (d) Each of the Company, Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges
that (i) the agreements contained in this Section 9.03 are an integral part
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these
agreements, Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not
enter into this Agreement and (iii) any amount payable pursuant to this
Section 9.03 is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate the Company, Ultimate Parent, Parent
and Merger Sub in the circumstances in which such amount is payable. The
parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion and
in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on

Section 7.08. Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 9.03 shall be paid
by wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with this Section 9.03 to an
account designated by the party receiving the amounts payable pursuant to
this Section 9.03, provided that such payments can be delayed and such delay
will not give rise to a breach of a partys obligations under this Section
9.03 if the party who is to receive the applicable payment fails to provide
the paying party with wiring instructions at least two Business Days prior to
the date such fee is to be paid. If the Company or Parent, as applicable,
fails to pay when due any amount payable under this Section 9.03, then (i)

of-pocket costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred in connection with the collection of such overdue amount and the
enforcement by the other party of its rights under this Section 9.03 and (ii)
such party shall pay to the other party interest on such overdue amount (for
the period commencing as of the date such overdue amount was originally
required to be paid and ending on the date such overdue amount is actually
paid to Parent in full) at the rate of interest per annum equal to the "Prime
Rate" as set forth on the date such payment became past due in _The
Wall Street Journal_ "Money Rates" column, plus 350 basis points.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(j), the Companys
receipt of the Parent Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 9.03(c)
and the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section 9.03(e) shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and stockholders
against (i) Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) any of Ultimate
Parents, Parents or Merger Subs former, current and future Affiliates,
assignees, stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys and other Representatives (the Persons described in clauses
(i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ ") and (iii) any Financing
Source under the Debt Commitment Letters and their respective Affiliates,
Representatives, successors and assigns (those under this clause (iii),
collectively, the " _Lender Group_ ") for any losses or damages arising from
or relating to this Agreement, any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in

 



76  this Agreement or the failure of the Transaction to be consummated and none
of the Parent Parties or members of the Lender Group shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except that Parent shall remain
obligated for any of its expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations
contained in Section 7.08).

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the Companys rights set forth in Section 10.02, if Ultimate Parent, Parent
or Merger Sub fails to effect the Closing for any or no reason or otherwise
breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder, then the Companys sole
and exclusive remedy (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Sub or any member of the
Lender Group for any breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this
Agreement as provided, and only to the extent provided, in Section 9.01, and
either (i) receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee and other amounts,
if any, referenced in Section 7.08 and Section 9.03(e) and upon payment of the
Parent Termination Fee and such other amounts, no Person shall have any rights
or claims against Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letters, or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in
contract in tort or otherwise, and none of Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger
Sub shall have any further liability relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the Transaction (including the Debt Financing), or (ii) seek
damages in respect of a Willful Breach by Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger
Sub. Subject to the Companys rights set forth in Section 10.02, in no event
shall the Company seek or permit to be sought any losses or damages from, or
otherwise bring any Proceeding against, Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub
in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction, other than a Proceeding
to recover (i) either (A) payment of the Parent Termination Fee and other
amounts, if any, referenced in Section 9.03(e) or (B) damages in respect of a
Willful Breach by Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub and (ii) other
amounts, if any, referenced in Section 7.08, and for the avoidance of doubt,
none of Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub shall have any liability for
losses or damages of any kind or nature or arising in any circumstance in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than the foregoing. Nothing in this Section 9.03(g) shall in
any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which
Parent or any other member of the Parent Group may be liable under this
Agreement or the Transaction (including the Debt Financing). For the avoidance
of doubt, while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific
performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 and either the payment
of (y) the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.03(c) or (z) damages
in respect of a Willful Breach by Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub, under
no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 10.02 and
monetary damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee
or damages in respect of a Willful Breach.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(b), Section
9.01(e) or Section 9.01(f), Parents receipt of the Company Termination Fee
from the Company pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(i)(iv), as the case may be, and
the payment of any amounts due pursuant to Section 9.03(e) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub against (i) the
Company and (ii) any of the Companys former, current and future Affiliates,
assignees, stockholders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys and other Representatives

 



77  (the Persons described in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Company
Parties_ ") for any losses or damages arising from or relating to this
Agreement, any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
in this Agreement or the failure of the Transaction to be consummated, and
none of the Company Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the rights of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section
10.02, if the Company fails to effect the Closing for any or no reason or
otherwise breaches this Agreement or fails to perform hereunder, then the sole
and exclusive remedy of Ultimate Parent, Parent and Merger Sub (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Company for any
breach, loss or damage shall be to terminate this Agreement as provided, and
only to the extent provided, in Section 9.01, and either (i) receive payment
of the Company Termination Fee and other amounts, if any, referenced in
Section 9.03(e) and upon payment of the Company Termination Fee and such other
amounts, no Person shall have any rights or claims against the Company under
this Agreement or otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort or
otherwise, and the Company shall not have any further liability relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction or (ii) seek damages in
respect of a Willful Breach by the Company. Subject to the rights of Ultimate
Parent, Parent and Merger Sub set forth in Section 10.02, in no event shall
Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub seek or permit to be sought any losses
or damages from, or otherwise bring any Proceeding against the Company in
connection with this Agreement or the Transaction, other than a Proceeding to
recover either (i) payment of the Company Termination Fee and other amounts,
if any, referenced in Section 9.03(e) or (ii) damages in respect of a Willful
Breach by the Company, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not
have any liability for losses or damages of any kind or nature or arising in
any circumstance in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement other than the foregoing. Nothing in this
Section 9.03(i) shall in any way expand or be deemed or construed to expand
the circumstances in which the Company or any other member of the Company
Group may be liable under this Agreement or the Transaction (including the
Debt Financing). For the avoidance of doubt, while Ultimate Parent, Parent or
Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the type
contemplated by Section 10.02 and either the payment of (y) the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(i)(iv), as the case may be, or
(z) damages in respect of a Willful Breach by the Company, under no
circumstances shall Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the type
contemplated by Section 10.02 and monetary damages, including all or any
portion of the Company Termination Fee or damages in respect of a Willful
Breach.

(j) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the Company, on behalf
of itself and each of its stockholders, partners, members, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, controlling persons and other Representatives
(each, a " _Seller Related Party_ ") agrees that none of the Lender Group
shall have any liability or obligation to any Seller Related Party in
connection with the financing of any portion of the Debt Financing, whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Section 10.07 (to
the extent relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or Lender Group), 10.08(b)
and 10.09 and this Section 9.03(j) are intended to benefit and may be enforced
by the Lender Group.

Section 10.02 Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance.

 

(a) The rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not
alternative). The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if
any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled to at law or in equity, in each
case without the requirement of posting any bond or other type of security.
Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
any other party has an adequate remedy at law. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event of a termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which
the Parent Termination Fee is paid, the Company will not be entitled to seek
or obtain a decree or order of specific performance to enforce the observance
or performance of, and will not be entitled to seek or obtain an injunction
restraining the breach of, or to seek or obtain damages or any other remedy at
law or in equity relating to any breach of, any covenant or obligation of
Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event of a termination of this Agreement under circumstances in which the
Company Termination Fee is paid, none of Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub
will be entitled to seek or obtain a decree or order of specific performance
to enforce the observance or performance of, and will not be entitled to seek
or obtain an injunction restraining the breach of, or to seek or obtain
damages or any other remedy at law or in equity relating to any breach of, any
covenant or obligation of the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to the Companys
right to seek specific performance of Parents and Ultimate Parents
obligation to enforce the Debt Commitment in accordance with Section 7.08(b),
the Company shall not be entitled to specific performance or any other
equitable relief in order to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger or the Transaction unless:

(i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02 (other
than conditions which are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing)
have been satisfied;

 



80 (ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.01;

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms thereof
or would be funded at the Closing; and

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, then the
Closing will occur.

Section 10.03 No Survival of Representations and Warranties __. __ The
representations and warranties of contained herein and in any certificate or
other writing delivered at the Closing pursuant hereto shall not survive the
Effective Time.

 

Section 10.04 Amendments and Waivers.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amendment or waiver shall be
made subsequent to receipt of the Required Company Stockholder Approval which
requires further approval of the stockholders of the Company pursuant to the
DGCL without such further stockholder approval.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Section
9.03(f), Section 9.03(g), Section 9.03(j), Section 10.07 and Section 10.08(b)
and this Section 10.04(b) (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of Section 9.03(f), Section 9.03(g), Section 9.03(j), Section 10.07
and Section 10.08(b) and this Section 10.04(b)) may not be modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to the
Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

(c) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 10.05 Disclosure Schedule References __. The parties hereto agree
that any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
or Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, shall only be deemed to be
an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(b) any other representations and warranties of such party that are contained
in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties would
be reasonably apparent to an individual who has read that reference and such
representations and warranties. The listing of any matter on a partys

 



81  Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by such
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to
be disclosed by such party under this Agreement or falls within relevant
minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No
disclosure in a partys Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or
violation by such party of any Contract or Applicable Law shall be construed
as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in a partys
Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of such
partys representations, warranties and/or covenants set forth in this
Agreement.

Section 10.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. Except with respect to Sections 7.05, 9.03(j), 10.07 (to the extent
relating to the Debt Commitment Letters or Financing Sources), 10.08(b) and
10.09, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that, after the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub may
transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole
or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any
time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such
transfer or assignment shall not relieve Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub
of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any
other party hereto or due to Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Sub. Any
purported assignment in violation of this Section 10.06(b) shall be void.

 

Section 10.07 Governing Law __. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws that would require the
application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Agreement and all disputes or controversies arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether in law, contract, tort, equity or otherwise), in each case, solely to

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

Section 10.10 Counterparts; Effectiveness __. This Agreement may be signed
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the
same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall
have received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other parties hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.
