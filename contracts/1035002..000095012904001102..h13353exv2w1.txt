         Section 2.5 Net Working Capital Adjustment.

                  (a) If the Net Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Net Working Capital, Buyer shall make an additional payment to Seller in an
amount equal to the amount by which the Net Working Capital, as calculated in
accordance with this Section 2.5, exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital,
which payment shall be made on or before the fifth Business Day after the final
determination of the Net Working Capital Adjustment in accordance with this
Section 2.5. If the Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated Net Working
Capital, Seller shall make a payment to Buyer in an amount equal to the amount
by which the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital, as
calculated in accordance with this Section 2.5. The payment to be made by Buyer
or by Seller, as applicable, is herein called the "Net Working Capital
Adjustment."

                  (b) (1) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2.5(b),
         or in the definitions of Current Assets and Current Liabilities, the
         items included in the components of Current Assets and Current
         Liabilities shall be determined, and the amounts of such items shall be
         calculated, in the same manner as the corresponding line items were
         determined and calculated, and using the same policies, practices,
         assumptions, procedures, classifications, methods, estimates and
         judgments as were used, in preparing the Balance Sheet to the extent
         the same are in accordance with GAAP.

                  (2) The portion of the Net Working Capital Statement relating
         to Inventory shall be prepared based on a physical inventory performed
         by Seller and Buyer carried out in accordance with the procedures,
         including the measurement procedures, specified in Exhibit D, and (ii)
         shall be commenced on the Closing Date, and shall be completed within
         24 hours after the Closing Date. The Inventory shall be included in
         Current Assets as Inventory at fair market value, determined based on
         the market price indices set forth in Exhibit D; except with respect to
         crude oil that is in transit to the terminals at the refinery, which
         shall be included in Current Assets with a value equal to the product
         of (A) the volume stated in its bill of lading, and (B) the appropriate
         price, determined based on the market price indices set forth in
         Exhibit D, and any rights of recovery associated with the
         transportation of such crude oil shall be for the account of Buyer.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, Inventory not yet paid for by the
         Company or any Transferred Subsidiary at Closing, whether in transit or
         otherwise, shall not be included in Current Assets. Mutually acceptable
         arrangements will be made, effective as of the Closing, to release
         Seller and its Affiliates from any and all liability (including the
         release of any Lien) in respect of financing arrangements or purchase
         obligations for Inventory not yet paid for by the Company at Closing,
         whether in transit to the Company or its Transferred Subsidiaries, or
         otherwise in the custody of the Company or any of its



                                       15
<PAGE>


         Transferred Subsidiaries, but for which payment Seller or any of its
         Affiliates (other than the Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries) is
         liable, either directly, or as the account party under a letter of
         credit or similar arrangement, or by which any such party's assets are
         burdened.

                           (3) With respect to the Parts and Supplies included
         in Current Assets, Buyer and Seller have agreed that such Parts and
         Supplies have an aggregate book value as of the Execution Date of
         $30,743,000 (the "Preliminary Parts and Supplies Value"). Within ten
         Business Days after the Closing, Seller shall run an inventory report
         from Seller's PeopleSoft Inventory System to determine the consumption
         or purchase of Parts and Supplies during the period following the
         Execution Date until the Closing Date. In addition, during the 30-day
         period immediately following the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall
         conduct an obsolescence review of the Parts and Supply and negotiate in
         good faith to determine any adjustments to the Preliminary Parts and
         Supplies Value necessary to reflect such obsolescence. The Preliminary
         Parts and Supplies Value shall be adjusted (x) to reflect the
         consumption and purchases identified in the post-Closing inventory
         report identified above and (y) to reflect the adjustments arising out
         of the obsolescence review above, with such adjusted amount (the "Final
         Parts and Supplies Value") being used in the final calculation of
         Current Assets in the Net Working Capital.

                  (c) Seller shall initially calculate the Net Working Capital
and shall deliver to Buyer a statement (the "Net Working Capital Statement")
setting forth the amount of Net Working Capital, together with supporting
calculations and information, on or before the 45th day after the Closing Date.
From the Closing Date through the final determination of Net Working Capital in
accordance with this Section 2.5(c), Buyer shall cause the Company and its
employees to give Seller and its advisors access at all reasonable times to the
personnel, properties, and books and records of the Company and Buyer's working
papers, and Seller shall give Buyer and its advisors access at all reasonable
times to the personnel, properties and books and records of Seller and Seller's
working papers, in each case as reasonably requested for the purpose of
determining Net Working Capital. Unless Buyer gives notice to Seller on or
before the 15th day after Buyer's receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement
that Buyer disputes the Net Working Capital specified in the Net Working Capital
Statement, the Net Working Capital shall be as specified in the Net Working
Capital Statement. If Buyer gives notice to Seller on or before such 15th day
that it disputes the Net Working Capital specified in the Net Working Capital
Statement, Seller and Buyer shall consult in good faith and use all reasonable
efforts to agree upon the calculation of the Net Working Capital. If on or
before the 30th day after Buyer's receipt of the Net Working Capital Statement
Seller and Buyer have not agreed on the Net Working Capital, either Seller or
Buyer shall have the right to submit such matters as remain in dispute to one of
the U.S. offices of KPMG LLP, or such other accounting firm as Seller and Buyer
shall agree, for final resolution, which resolution shall be binding upon Seller
and Buyer, and judgment upon which may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is sought to be
enforced. Buyer shall pay the fees and expenses of such accounting firm for its
services in resolving such dispute; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the
right to recover one-half of such payment through a reduction in the amount of
any Net Working Capital Adjustment payable by Buyer in accordance with Section
2.5(a) or through a payment by Seller within 10 Business Days of receipt from
Buyer of an invoice for such fees.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.5(c) above,
Buyer shall have until 180 days following the Closing Date to identify (1)
additional accounts payable of any of the Combined Companies (x) relating to the
ownership or operation of the Business prior to Closing that were not entered
into the general accounting ledger of any of the Combined Companies prior to the
delivery of the Net Working Capital Statement to Buyer ("New Accounts Payable"),
and (2) any accounts payable that were included in the Current Liabilities set
forth in the Net Working Capital Statement but the amounts of which are in
excess of the amount included in such calculation (such excess amount being
referred to herein as "Excess Accounts Payable" and, together with the New
Accounts Payable, the "Additional Accounts Payable Amount"). On or prior to the
180th day following the Closing, the Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement
(the "Additional Accounts Payable Statement") setting forth the Additional
Accounts Payable Amount, together with supporting calculations and information.
Unless Seller gives notice to Buyer on or before the 15th day after Seller's
receipt of the Additional Accounts Payable Statement that Seller disputes the
Additional Accounts Payable Amount specified in such Statement, the Additional
Accounts Payable Amount shall be as specified in the Additional Accounts Payable
Statement. If Seller gives notice to Buyer on or before such 15th day that it
disputes the Additional Accounts Payable Amount specified in the Additional
Accounts Payable Statement, Seller and Buyer shall consult in good faith and use
all reasonable efforts to agree upon the calculation of the Additional Accounts
Payable Amount. If on or before the 30th day after Seller's receipt of the
Additional Accounts Payable Statement Seller and Buyer have not agreed on the
Additional Accounts Payable Amount, either Seller or Buyer shall have the right
to submit such matters as remain in dispute to one of the U.S. offices of KPMG
LLP, or such other accounting firm as Seller and Buyer shall agree, for final
resolution, which resolution shall be binding upon Seller and Buyer, and
judgment upon which may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the
party against which such determination is sought to be enforced. Buyer shall pay
the fees and expenses of such accounting firm for its services in resolving such
dispute; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to recover one-half
of such payment through a payment by Seller within 10 Business Days of receipt
from Buyer of an invoice for such fees. Seller shall make payment to Buyer of
the Additional Accounts Payable Amount within 10 Business Days of final
resolution of the Additional Accounts Payable Amount pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 2.5(d).

ordinary course of business, and (ii) indebtedness to Affiliates of the Company
(other than Transferred Subsidiaries) that will be settled prior to Closing;

                  (o) not destroy any books or records of the Company or any of

which would, survive the Closing.

         Section 6.2 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings. From the Execution
Date until the Closing:

                  (a) Seller and Buyer shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts (i) to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or to cause to be done, all things that, in either case, are necessary, proper,
or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to obtain from the
relevant Governmental Authorities all Authorizations required to be obtained by
Seller or Buyer in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery, and

                                       30
<PAGE>


shall cooperate in connection with the making of all such filings, through,
among other means, providing copies of all such documents to the nonfiling party
and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting all reasonable
additions, deletions, or changes suggested in connection therewith. Seller and
Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, upon reasonable, prior notice to Seller, and after advising
Seller concerning the subject matter of the proposed negotiations, Buyer may
negotiate directly with the Government of Aruba and all Aruban Governmental
Authorities regarding the transactions contemplated hereby, and in connection
with such negotiations (except as described in this sentence), Buyer is not
required to comply with the preceding two sentences.

                  (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.2(a), if
Seller and Buyer determine that notifications under the HSR Act are required in
connection with this Agreement, Seller and Buyer shall each use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its ultimate parent entity to file, as soon as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement, notifications under the
HSR Act in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and to respond
as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional
information or documentation and to respond as promptly as practicable to all
inquiries and requests received from any other Governmental Authority in
connection with antitrust matters relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer shall provide to the other a copy of
such filing materials under the HSR Act to the other prior to making such filing
and the parties hereto shall confer on the matters set forth therein.

                  (c) Seller and Buyer shall each timely give or cause to be
given all notices to third Persons and use all commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all Third Person Consents (i) required under any Material Contract in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii)
otherwise required to prevent a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Business or the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, from
occurring prior to or after the Closing.

                  (d) Seller and Buyer shall each give prompt notice to the
other of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication (i)
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(including a general summary of communications between Buyer or Buyer's
Affiliates and any Aruban Governmental Authority consistent with Buyer's
obligations pursuant to Section 6.2(a)), (iii) from any Governmental Authority
or other Person regarding the initiation or threat of initiation of any claims,
actions, suits, proceedings, arbitrations, or investigations against, relating
to, or involving or otherwise affecting the Company, Buyer, or Seller that
relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv)
from any Person regarding the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the
occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be reasonably likely (A) to cause any
condition to the obligations of the other party to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby not to be satisfied, (B) to cause a breach of the
representations, warranties, or covenants of such party under this Agreement, or
(C) to delay or impede the ability of either Buyer or Seller, respectively, to
consummate the transactions



                                       31
<PAGE>


contemplated by this Agreement or to fulfill their respective obligations set
forth herein. No delivery of any notice pursuant to clause (iv) of this Section
6.2(d) shall cure any breach of any representation or warranty of the party
hereto giving such notice contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party hereto receiving such
notice.

                  (e) Buyer and Seller each agree to cooperate and to use all
commercially reasonable efforts vigorously to contest and to resist any action,
including legislative, administrative, or judicial action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed, or overturned any order (whether temporary, preliminary, or
permanent) of any court or other Governmental Authority that is in effect and
that restricts, prevents, or prohibits the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the vigorous pursuit of all available
avenues of administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative
action. Each of Buyer and Seller shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all
actions, other than the disposition of assets or the withdrawal from doing
business in particular jurisdictions, required by any Governmental Authority as
a condition to the granting of any Authorization necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or as may be required to avoid, lift,
vacate, or reverse any legislative, administrative, or judicial action that
would otherwise cause any Closing Condition not to be satisfied.

                  (f) El Paso and other Affiliates of the Combined Companies,
including El Paso CGP (together, the "El Paso Guarantors"), have provided
support to the Combined Companies pursuant to certain guarantees and related
agreements, including those guaranties set forth in Section 6.2(f) of the
Disclosure Schedule (the "Support Obligations"). Buyer and its Affiliates shall
use best efforts to effect the complete release of the El Paso Guarantors from
all of the obligations arising from and related to the Support Obligations in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to the El Paso Guarantors, including by means of
substitution of a guaranty or other undertaking by Valero Energy Corporation or
other Affiliate of Buyer for the Support Obligations, a letter of credit, an
escrow of funds, posting a bond, or other arrangements. If the El Paso
Guarantors have not been so released from the Support Obligations on or before
the Closing Date, then the unreleased Support Obligations shall be included as
"Unreleased Support Obligations" under, and as defined in, the Indemnification
Agreement. If Valero is unsuccessful in obtaining the complete release of El
Paso CGP from all of the obligations under the Refinery Agreement Guaranty prior
to Closing, then until the El Paso CGP is so released, neither Buyer nor any
Affiliate of Buyer:

                           (i) shall transfer any interest in the Downtown
Parcel or any rights that are currently held by CARC therein, either directly or
indirectly, by the transfer of such assets, or by the transfer of an interest in
a direct or indirect owner of such assets to the Government of Aruba or to any
other Governmental Authority of Aruba; or

                           (ii) amend, or take any action (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), that would have the effect of
amending, the Refinery Agreement; or

                           (iii) sell the refinery, including the delayed
petroleum coker assets or any material portion thereof, or transfer any direct
or indirect ownership interest in any owner of



                                       32
<PAGE>


such assets to any Person that is not a wholly owned Subsidiary of Valero Energy
Corporation; or

                           (iv) permanently cease operations or cease refining
operations for thirty-six consecutive calendar months at the refinery.

This Section 6.2(f) shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect until
the complete release of El Paso CGP from all of the obligations under the
Refinery Agreement Guaranty.

                  (g) Promptly after the Execution Date, Seller will cause CARC
to notify Vitol of CARC's election to terminate the Vitol Agreement.

                           (i) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to persuade Vitol to terminate the
Vitol Agreement on or before Closing; provided that neither Buyer nor Seller
shall be obligated to make any payment to Vitol to induce Vitol to agree to such
termination.

                           (ii) If the Vitol Agreement is terminated on or
before Closing, CARC (if such termination is prior to Closing) or Buyer (if such
termination is on the Closing Date) shall purchase Vitol's products inventory at
the price negotiated with Vitol in connection with the termination of the Vitol
Agreement. If CARC purchases Vitol's products inventory, then such inventory
shall be part of the inventory included in Current Assets for purposes of
calculating Net Working Capital (and the value thereof shall be deemed to be the
price paid for such inventory, plus interest thereon at the Applicable Rate from
the date purchased until the Closing Date); provided, however, that if CARC
purchases Vitol's Tank Bottoms (as defined in the Vitol Agreement) pursuant to
Section 15.3 of the Vitol Agreement, the value of the products inventory
comprising the Tank Bottoms shall be determined using the pricing schedule
attached as Exhibit D hereto.

                           (iii) If the Vitol Agreement is not terminated on or
before the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall enter into an agreement on the
Closing Date relating to Seller's make-whole payments to Buyer relating to the
Vitol Agreement's pricing terms. Such make-whole agreement shall incorporate the
terms set forth on Exhibit F attached hereto.

                           (iv) Regardless of whether the Vitol Agreement is
terminated on or before Closing, for purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital, (a) any outstanding amounts payable by Vitol to CARC under the Vitol
Agreement as of the Closing Date shall be included in Current Assets and (b) any
outstanding amounts payable by CARC to Vitol under the Vitol Agreement as of the
Closing Date shall be included in Current Liabilities.

                           (v) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will have the
right to negotiate directly with Vitol for the purchase of Vitol's product
inventory.

                  (h) Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to agree
upon the terms of a Transition Services Agreement to be executed and delivered
by El Paso Merchant Energy - Petroleum Company and Buyer, which shall include
the provision by El Paso Merchant Energy - Petroleum Company of services, as
generally described in the form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto
as Exhibit E.



                                       33
<PAGE>


                  (i) In connection with the termination of the Vitol Agreement,
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Marathon's
consent to the assignment of the rights of EPME under the Marathon Agreement to
CARC. If such consent is not obtained effective on the date of termination of
the Vitol Agreement, then Seller will cause CARC (if the Vitol Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing Date), or Buyer will cause CARC (if the Vitol
Agreement is terminated after the Closing Date), to enter into an agreement with
EPME, the effect of which is to put EPME in the same position as if EPME had
assigned the Marathon Agreement to CARC.

                  (j) In connection with termination of the Vitol Agreement,
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain AirBP's
consent to the assignment of the rights of EPME under the BP Agreement to CARC.
If such consent is not obtained effective on the date of termination of the
Vitol Agreement, then Seller will cause CARC (if the Vitol Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing Date), or Buyer will cause CARC (if the Vitol
Agreement is terminated after the Closing Date), to enter into an agreement with
EPME, the effect of which is to put EPME in the same position as if EPME had
assigned the BP Agreement to CARC. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
after the Closing, if Buyer or CARC requests, in writing, that EPME terminate
the BP Agreement, so long as either the Vitol Agreement or the agreement with
CARC described in this Section 6.2(j) will be in effect for the entire period
beginning with the request to terminate the BP Agreement and ending with the
termination of the BP Agreement, EPME shall notify AirBP of EPME's election to
terminate the BP Agreement.

                  (k) In the event the Intercompany Debt is not eliminated by
March 30, 2004, Seller, the Company or Seller's Affiliates will cause a properly
completed election to be timely filed for CARC under Code Sec. 7701 (and the
regulations promulgated thereunder) to treat CARC as an entity disregarded for
U.S. federal income tax purposes effective not later than March 30, 2004, and
Buyer agrees not to make a Section 338 election with respect to CARC.

                  (l) Buyer and Seller shall work diligently to execute the
Other Agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G, on or
before three Business Days after the Execution Date.

         Section 6.3 Breach Notice. If, prior to the Closing Date, Buyer obtains
Knowledge of a breach of any of Seller's representations, warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of
such information (the "Breach Notice") within 10 Business Days of such discovery
or on the day prior to the Closing Date, whichever is earlier. The Breach Notice
shall contain reasonable details regarding the alleged breach and Buyer's good
faith estimate of the potential Losses associated with such breach.

         Section 6.4 Right of Entry. Buyer hereby acknowledges that any access
to the refinery and other assets of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries
utilized by Buyer or any representative, consultant or other Person acting by or
on behalf of Buyer ("Diligence Representative") shall be at the sole risk, cost,
and expense of Buyer. Buyer shall and shall ensure that each Diligence
Representative complies with all safety and similar requirements customarily
imposed by the Company on its properties provided that the Company has provided
to Buyer a description of, such safety and other requirements. Buyer shall
assume and



                                       34
<PAGE>


indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller Indemnitees from and against any
and all claims for personal injury, death or property damage arising out of
Buyer's or any Diligence Representative's entry upon or access to the refinery
and other assets of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and all
damages, losses, cost and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, costs
of court and investigative fees) incurred by the Seller Indemnitees with respect
to each such claim, IN EACH CASE REGARDLESS OF THE NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT
(OTHER THAN THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF THE SELLER
INDEMNITEES, THE COMPANY OR ANY EMPLOYEE OF ANY SUCH PERSON) OF THE SELLER
INDEMNITEES, THE COMPANY OR ANY EMPLOYEE OF ANY SUCH PERSON.

         Section 6.5 Condition of the Company's Assets. In consummating the
purchase and the sale of the Shares contemplated hereunder, Buyer acknowledges
that it will become the owner of the Company, the Transferred Subsidiaries, and
their respective assets and Buyer accepts such assets in their AS-IS, WHERE-IS,
CONDITION, WITH ALL FAULTS, WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED COVENANT, WARRANTY AS
TO TITLE, CONDITION (INCLUDING ANY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION), MERCHANTABILITY,
PERFORMANCE, FITNESS (BOTH GENERALLY AND FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE) OR
OTHERWISE (WHICH WARRANTIES SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS), OR RECOURSE,
OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN ANY DOCUMENTS DELIVERED AT
CLOSING.

         Section 6.6 Independent Investigation. Buyer acknowledges and affirms
that (i) it has had full access to the Data Room, the information contained in,
or made available or provided with respect to materials contained in, such Data
Room, and to other information made available by Seller and its representatives
during the course of Buyer's due diligence investigation of the Company, (ii) it
has had access to the personnel, officers, professional advisors, operations,
and records of Seller and the Company. As of Closing, Buyer will have completed
its independent investigation, verification, analysis, review and evaluation of
this Agreement, the Business, and the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries,
as Buyer has deemed necessary or appropriate. EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
EXPRESSLY MADE BY SELLER IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY DOCUMENTS DELIVERED AT
CLOSING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES: (a) THAT THERE ARE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES,
STATEMENTS, ASSURANCES OR GUARANTEES MADE BY SELLER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO
(i) THE COMPANY'S ASSETS, OR (ii) THE LIABILITIES, BUSINESS, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, CONDITION (FINANCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHERWISE) OR PROSPECTS
RELATING TO THE BUSINESS, AND THAT IN MAKING ITS DECISION TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND TO CONSUMMATE THE PURCHASE OF THE SHARES, BUYER HAS RELIED AND
WILL RELY SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, VERIFICATION, ANALYSIS

ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, STATEMENT OR INFORMATION ORALLY OR IN WRITING MADE

(c) THAT NEITHER SELLER NOR ANY AFFILIATE OF SELLER HAS MADE AND SELLER HEREBY
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND NEGATES, ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS



                                       35
<PAGE>


WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR CONFORMITY TO
MODELS OR SAMPLES AND ANY OTHER REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY

ENVIRONMENTAL USE OR CONDITION), THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
AT, ON OR UNDER ANY PORTION OF THE REFINERY OR THE COMPANY'S OTHER ASSETS,
COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE STATUTES, LAWS, CODES, ORDINANCES, REGULATIONS OR
REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO LEASING, ZONING, SUBDIVISION, PLANNING, LAND USE,

INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL, REGIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, PROVINCIAL OR LOCAL

         Section 6.7 Supplement to Disclosure Schedule. Seller may, from time to
time prior to the Closing by written notice to Buyer, supplement or amend the
Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement to correct any matter that would
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller in ARTICLE III
or ARTICLE IV. For purposes of determining whether Buyer's conditions set forth
in Section 8.3 have been fulfilled and subject to Section 6.8 and to the
following sentence, for purposes of asserting any claims for indemnification
under Section 10.2, the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to include only that

         Section 6.8 Adjustments for Supplements and Breach Notice. If Buyer
delivers a Breach Notice to Seller pursuant to Section 6.3 or Seller supplements
the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to Section 6.7, or both, Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to agree upon an adjustment to the Purchase Price to
reflect the information provided in the Breach Notice or supplement. If Buyer
and Seller agree on an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section
6.8, Buyer shall be deemed to waive any further right to make a claim with
respect thereto under this Agreement or otherwise.

                                   ARTICLE VII

                   POST-CLOSING COVENANTS AND EMPLOYEE MATTERS

         Section 7.1 Expatriate Employee Matters.

                  (a) Section 7.1 of the Disclosure Schedule lists all employees
of Seller and its Affiliates that have been seconded to and regularly provide
services to the Company or the Combined Companies (collectively, the "Expatriate
Employees") as of the Execution Date, including dates of hire of such Expatriate
Employees. Seller shall update Section 7.1 of the Disclosure Schedule as
necessary prior to the Closing to reflect all employment changes.



                                       36
<PAGE>


                  (b) During the 15 day period immediately following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall interview each Expatriate Employee, other than employees who
are receiving short-term or long-term disability benefits or are on family,
medical, administrative or military leave or any other type of leave, for
possible employment with Buyer, effective as of the 45th day after the Closing
Date (the "Transferred Employee Transfer Date"). In the event that Buyer, in its
sole discretion, determines to offer employment with Buyer to any such
Expatriate Employee, such employment shall be at base salaries and wages that
are no less favorable than the base salaries and wages provided by Seller and
its Affiliates to such Expatriate Employees as of the Execution Date, all as
consistent with Buyer's policies and practices for employees with similar
positions, at a location that does not require employee relocation and on the
same status (e.g., full-time or part-time). Buyer will give each such Expatriate
Employee to whom an offer of employment is made no less than seven days in which
to accept or reject Buyer's employment offer. Buyer shall notify Seller of each
Expatriate Employee that accepts Buyer's offer of employment as promptly as
possible after the date of such acceptance but in no event later than the
Business Day immediately prior to the Transferred Employee Transfer Date. All
Expatriate Employees who accept employment with Buyer pursuant to the offers
described in this Section 7.1(b) shall be referred to herein as "Transferred
Employees." Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
medical or other records related to Expatriate Employees shall be provided to
Buyer to the extent prohibited by applicable Law. Seller shall retain sole
responsibility (including responsibility for any severance payments) for all
Expatriate Employees who are not Transferred Employees ("Retained Expatriate
Employees"); provided that if Buyer hires any of the Retained Expatriate
Employees prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer will
reimburse Seller for all repatriation costs incurred in respect of such Retained
Expatriate Employee and any severance (and severance-related) benefits paid to
such Retained Expatriate Employee promptly upon receipt by Buyer from Seller of
an invoice for such costs.

                  (c) All Transferred Employees shall become employees of Buyer
(or Buyer's designated Affiliate) as of 12:01 A.M. of the respective local time
where the Transferred Employees are located as of the Transferred Employee
Transfer Date and, at such time, Buyer (or Buyer's designated Affiliate) shall
become responsible for payment of all salaries and benefits and all other
claims, costs, expenses, liabilities and other obligations relating to Buyer's
(or Buyer's designated Affiliate) employment of the Transferred Employees
accruing or occurring from and after the Transferred Employee Transfer Date.
Except as otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller or its
Affiliates, as the case may be, shall be responsible for all claims, costs,
expenses, liabilities and other obligations relating to the employment of the
Transferred Employees by Seller or its Affiliates before the Transferred
Employee Transfer Date and Buyer shall be responsible for all such claims,
costs, expenses, liabilities and other obligations relating to the employment of
the Transferred Employees after the Transferred Employee Transfer Date. For
purposes of the preceding two sentences, a claim for medical, dental, vision or
other health benefits shall be deemed to be incurred upon the occurrence of a
qualified expense for which reimbursement is sought. To the extent any
Expatriate Employee provides transition services to Buyer, the Company, or any
of the Combined Companies after the Closing Date, any reimbursement to Seller or
Seller's Affiliates for any salaries, benefits, or expenses paid in respect of
such Expatriate Employee shall be governed by the Transition Services Agreement.



                                       37
<PAGE>


                  (d) All Transferred Employees shall cease active participation
in all Seller Plans as of 11:59 P.M. on the day prior to the Transferred
Employee Transfer Date. As of the Transferred Employee Transfer Date, all
Transferred Employees shall be permitted to participate in the plans, programs
and arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates relating to compensation and
employee benefits (each, a "Buyer Plan") on the same terms as similarly situated
employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. On or before the Transferred Employee
Transfer Date, Seller shall take all actions necessary, if any, to cause the
Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to cease to be an adopting or
participating employer under the Seller Plans. Buyer shall not, and from and
after the Closing the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not, have
any responsibility or liability with respect to the Seller Plans.

                  (e) To the extent that any Transferred Employees become
eligible to participate in any Buyer Plan, for purposes of terms of employment,
eligibility, vesting and benefit determination (other than for benefit accrual
purposes under any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical plan),
service and seniority with Seller or its Affiliates shall be recognized under
such Buyer Plan. Such credited service shall also be recognized for purposes of
satisfying any pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation by and coverage of the Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents in Buyer Plans. In addition, all Buyer
Plans that are group health plans shall (i) waive any pre-existing condition
restrictions and waiting periods with respect to the Transferred Employees and
their eligible dependents, (ii) provide that any expenses incurred by or on
behalf of any such individuals during the applicable plan year through and until
the Transferred Employee Transfer Date shall be taken into account under the
applicable Buyer Plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions for the remainder of the plan
year for such applicable Buyer Plans and (iii) waive any actively-at-work
exclusions.

                  (f) In the event that the employment of any Transferred
Employee is terminated by Buyer within one year following the Closing (other
than for termination due to violation of generally applicable policies of Buyer
or other circumstances reasonably constituting cause), then Buyer shall provide
such Transferred Employee with severance pay and benefits equal to the greater
of (i) the severance pay and benefits available under the severance program of
Buyer available to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates or
(ii) the severance pay and benefits under the severance pay plan of Seller or
any of its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employee participated
immediately prior to the Closing.

         Section 7.2 Company Employee Matters.

                  (a) Buyer shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to
permit the employees of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries (the
"Company Employees") to continue to participate from and after the Closing Date
in the Transferred Subsidiary Plans and all other employee benefit plans,
agreements, arrangements, programs, or policies maintained by the Company or the
Transferred Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing Date (collectively,
the "Current Company Benefit Plans"), including, without limitation, each
personnel policy, bonus plan or arrangement, incentive award plan or
arrangement, vacation policy, severance pay plan or agreement, change of control
plan or agreement, retention bonus plan or agreement, deferred compensation
agreement or arrangement, and employment agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may permit or cause any such Current Company Benefit Plan to be



                                       38
<PAGE>


terminated or discontinued on or after the Closing Date (except as otherwise
specifically prohibited by any Current Company Benefit Plan), provided that
Buyer shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to permit the Company
Employees participating in such Current Company Benefit Plan to immediately
thereafter participate in the comparable Buyer Plan maintained by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates for their similarly situated employees, including severance
pay plans or policies, and that such Buyer Plans shall, at least until the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, provide benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the benefits provided the Company Employees under
such Current Company Benefit Plans. If the Current Company Benefit Plan that is
terminated or discontinued by Buyer is a group health plan, then Buyer shall
permit each Company Employee participating in such group health plan to be
covered under a Buyer Plan that (i) provides medical and dental benefits to each
such Company Employee effective immediately upon the cessation of coverage of
such individuals under such group health plan, (ii) credits such Company

years of service and level of seniority with the Company and the Transferred
Subsidiaries for purposes of terms of employment and eligibility, vesting and
benefit determination under the Buyer Plans.

                  (b) Provided that Buyer shall not be obligated with respect to
any action taken by the Company or any of the Transferred Subsidiaries with
respect to the Transferred Subsidiary Plans in violation of the provisions of
Section 6.1, Buyer hereby agrees to cause the Company and each Transferred
Subsidiary from and after the Closing Date to honor and perform all obligations
of the Company under all Current Company Benefit Plans or as otherwise

Employees after Buyer's purchase of the Shares of the Company.

         Section 7.3 Insurance Claims and DESC Claims. From and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall permit, and shall cause the Company to permit, Seller
or its designees to prosecute the DESC Claims and the Insurance Claims, as
described in Sections 1.1(b) and 1.1(d), respectively, of the Disclosure

Company to, at Seller's sole cost and expense, (a) execute and deliver such
documents as shall be reasonably required in connection with the foregoing, (b)
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the prosecuting party and its counsel
with respect to the Insurance Claims and the DESC Claims, including making

proceeds received in connection with the Insurance Claims and the DESC Claims,
including any payment with respect to any settlement, judgment, or enforcement
proceeding. To the extent permitted under the Law and the applicable insurance
policy or any other contractual limitation, at Buyer's request, Seller shall

Buyer's designee) promptly upon receipt (i) property damage insurance proceeds
from third party insurers (excluding any captive insurance company Affiliates of
Seller) related to the Assets to the extent (A) an insured property damage loss
occurs prior to the Closing Date, and (B) such insurance proceeds have not been
applied to effect repairs prior to the Closing Date and (ii) business
interruption insurance proceeds from third party insurers (excluding any captive
insurance company Affiliates of Seller) related to the Assets to the extent (A)
the insured claim period covered by such business interruption insurance extends
past the Closing Date (it being understood that Seller shall have the right to
terminate coverage under its insurance policies effective as of the Closing
Date) and (B) the insurance proceeds only apply to the insured claim period
extending beyond the Closing Date. Seller shall retain all rights to property
damage and business interruption insurance proceeds from third party insurers
(including any captive insurance company proceeds) related to the Insurance
Claims. However, to the extent such insurance proceeds related to the Insurance
Claims have not been applied to effect pending repairs Seller shall remit or
cause to be remitted such proceeds to Buyer upon (A) completion and payment of

dispose of any records acquired, removed, or retained hereunder for a period of
five (5) years following the Closing Date or such longer period as required by

prior written notice to the other party. During such five-year period, each
party shall make such records available to the other party or its authorized
representatives for any business, legal or technical need in a manner that does
not unreasonably interfere with the record holder's business operations. Seller
agrees to cooperate with Buyer and to use best efforts to cause its independent
public accountants to cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of any financial
statements and pro forma financial statements required under applicable Law in
connection with the transactions provided under this Agreement and the Other
Agreement.

                  (b) Tax Returns.

                      (i) From and after the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer will
         provide each other with such cooperation and information as each may
         reasonably request of the other with regard to the preparation and
         filing of Tax Returns related to the Business, or the conduct of an
         audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes related to the Business.
         Such information includes records and information reasonably requested
         with respect to any periods prior to the Closing Date.

                      (ii) From the date of this Agreement through and after the
         date of Closing, Seller shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in
         proper form to the appropriate Taxing Authority (or cause to be
         prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner (taking into
         account all applicable extensions) all Tax Returns relating to the
         Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries that are due on or before or
         related to any statutory taxable period ending on or before the Closing
         Date. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for Taxes of the Company and its
         Transferred Subsidiaries with respect to such periods within 45 days
         after payment by Buyer or the Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries
         of such Taxes to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in Current
         Liabilities. Buyer shall reimburse Seller, within such 45 day period,
         to the extent the Taxes of the Company reflected in Current Liabilities
         exceed the Taxes of the Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries with
         respect to such periods.

                      (iii) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare
         and file or otherwise furnish, or cause to be prepared, filed or
         otherwise furnished, in proper form to the appropriate Taxing Authority
         in a timely manner (taking into account all applicable extensions) all
         Tax Returns relating to the Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries
         that are due after or related to any statutory period ending after the
         Closing Date. Buyer shall (y) not take or advocate any position
         inconsistent with this Agreement (including but not limited to the
         allocation of the purchase price herein); and (z) not take or advocate
         any position with respect to Taxes of Company and its Transferred
         Subsidiaries that reasonably could be expected to adversely affect
         Seller or that would have the effect of shifting income to a statutory
         taxable period ending on or before Closing Date, unless, in each case,
         Seller shall have consented in writing to such action by the Buyer.
         Seller shall pay to Buyer within 45 days after the date on which Taxes
         are paid with respect to such periods an amount equal to the portion of
         such Taxes allocable to the period ending on the day before the Closing
         Date as calculated pursuant to Section 7.5(c) to the extent such Taxes
         are not reflected in Current Liabilities. Buyer shall reimburse Seller,
         within such 45 day period, to the extent the Taxes of the Company
         reflected in Current Liabilities exceed an amount equal to the portion
         of such Taxes allocable to the period ending on the day before the
         Closing Date as calculated pursuant to Section 7.5(c).

                      (iv) Buyer shall not, with respect to any statutory
         taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date, (y) file any
         amended Tax Returns with respect to Company and its Transferred
         Subsidiaries; or (z) carry back any loss or other Tax attribute of
         Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries, unless in each case, Seller
         shall have consented in writing to such action by the Buyer which
         consent will not be unreasonably withheld.

                      (v) Without limiting any obligation of the Buyer under
         this Agreement, including Section 7.5(b)(iii), in the event that Buyer
         makes an election pursuant to section 338 of the Code or similar
         provisions of state or local law, Buyer shall use the allocations of
         the Purchase Price in this Agreement for purposes of the election. In
         addition, no later than 90 days prior to the due date for filings
         relating to allocations of the Purchase Price or other allocations
         pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the
         Code, Buyer shall prepare and furnish such filings to Seller for
         Seller's review. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate in making such
         allocation and Buyer and Seller shall agree in writing to such
         allocation no later than 60 days prior to the due date for the filing
         of such election. In the event Buyer and Seller disagree with the
         allocations with respect to the assets of the Company or the
         subsidiaries thereof pursuant to Treasury Regulations promulgated under
         Section 338 of the Code, Buyer shall engage an accounting firm mutually
         acceptable to both Seller and Buyer ("Auditor") to determine the proper
         allocations with respect to such assets. Decisions made by Auditor with
         respect to the allocations as to the assets shall be final, and the
         costs, expenses and fees of the Auditor shall be borne equally between
         Buyer and Seller.

                  (c) In the case of any statutory taxable period that includes
(but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), (i) real, personal
and intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") allocable to the period ending
on the Closing Date shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days during the Straddle Period that are before the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii)
the Taxes relating to Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries (other than
Property Taxes) allocable to the period ending on the day before the Closing
Date shall be computed as if such taxable period ended on the close of business
on the day before the Closing Date.

                  (d) Seller shall be entitled to the benefit of any refunds,
offsets or credits of Taxes paid with respect to the Company and its Transferred
Subsidiaries attributable to or arising in statutory taxable periods ending on
or before the Closing Date (plus any interest received with respect thereto from
the applicable Tax Authority) and secured by the same legal entity (such status
determined under local Tax law) upon which such Tax was imposed. Buyer shall be
entitled to the benefit of any refunds, offsets or credits of Taxes paid with
respect to the Company and its Transferred Subsidiaries attributable to or
arising in statutory taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date (plus any
interest received with respect thereto from the applicable Tax Authority) and
secured by the same legal entity (such status determined under local Tax law)
upon which such Tax was imposed. Any refunds, credits or offsets attributable to
or arising in the Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Buyer
and Seller. Seller or Buyer may be entitled to a payment equal to any refunds,
offsets or credits only after the party which has received an offset, credit or
refund has actually secured the cash benefit of such refund, offset or credit.

         Section 7.6 2003 Audited Financial Statements. On or before April 15,
2004, Seller shall provide Buyer, with audited combined financial statements of
the Combined Companies as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003. Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for one-half of all expenses incurred by Seller or that
are otherwise payable by Seller to third parties in connection with the
preparation of such financial statements. Seller shall provide management

representation letters in connection with such financial statements, which
letters shall be qualified to the knowledge of the individual's executing such
letters and shall be limited to the period from January 1, 2003 to the Closing
Date.

         Section 7.7 Additional Marine Assets. If, after good faith efforts to
agree upon a manner of transferring title to the Additional Marine Assets that
would not require the consent of MARAD, Seller and Buyer determine that the
mutually agreed manner of conveyance will require MARAD approval, Seller shall
cause El Paso Tankships USA Company to cooperate with Buyer, and Buyer will
coordinate, at Buyer's expense, obtaining MARAD's consent to the transfer of
title to the Additional Marine Assets to Buyer (or Buyer's designee). Seller
shall cause El Paso Tankships USA Company to transfer the Additional Marine
Assets within three Business Days after Seller and Buyer determine, working
together in good faith, that all Authorizations necessary for such transfer have
been obtained, but in any event, not earlier than the Closing Date. Buyer and
Seller recognize that the transfer of title to the Additional Marine Assets may
not be accomplished until after the Closing.

         Section 7.8 Tax Elections. Buyer, the Company, and their respective
Affiliates may make elections under Section 338 of the Code with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as provided in Section
6.2(k).

         Section 7.9 Collection of Aged Accounts Receivable. From and after the
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the
Aged Accounts Receivable for the benefit of Seller; provided, however, that
Buyer shall not be required to institute any suit or collection procedure if the
institution of any such suit or procedure would materially and adversely affect
the commercial relationship between the obligor thereunder and any of the
Transferred Subsidiaries. In the event any amount is collected by Buyer in
connection with any of the Aged Accounts Receivable, Buyer shall promptly pay
such amount to Seller. All payments received on the Aged Accounts Receivable
shall be first applied against the oldest Aged Accounts Receivable unless such
payment is made on a particular invoice or is clearly applicable to a particular
invoice based on the amount paid in which case the payment received will be
applied against such particular invoice. Buyer and Seller recognize that, during
the term of the Transition Services Agreement, employees of El Paso Merchant
Energy-Petroleum Company or its Affiliates will have responsibility for
collecting accounts receivable of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries,
including the Aged Accounts Receivable. The limitations on Buyer's instituting
suits or collection procedures to collect the Aged Accounts Receivable and the
priority of application of collections to particular accounts receivable
contained in this Section 7.9 shall also apply to El Paso Merchant
Energy-Petroleum Company's providing such services under the Transition Services
Agreement.

                  (a) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each other to
complete the Restructuring as expeditiously and efficiently as reasonably
practicable, regardless of whether the Restructuring is completed before the
Closing Date.

                  (b) If the portion of the Restructuring described in clause
(iii) of the definition of Restructuring is not completed by the Closing Date
(but, if applicable, the election under



                                       43

Section 6.2(k) is made), then a portion of the Purchase Price equal to 1.5% of
the Intercompany Debt outstanding on the Closing Date shall be placed in escrow
with an escrow agent mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller to be held and
released upon the terms described in this Section 8.3(a).

                           (i) The escrowed funds shall be invested in
instruments or securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United
States government, commercial paper of any U.S. Person with a short term credit
rating of A-2 P-2 or better, or such other investments as Buyer and Seller may
mutually agree;

                           (ii) For each $10,000,000 by which the Intercompany
Debt is reduced prior to June 30, 2004, 1.5% of such amount shall be released by
the escrow agent to Seller, together with all interest earned on such released
amount.

                           (iii) On July 1, 2004, any amount remaining in escrow
shall be released, first to pay the fees and expenses of the escrow agent and

                           (iv) Seller shall be responsible for paying all fees
and expenses of the escrow agent not paid in accordance with clause (iii) above.

                  (c) Upon payment to Buyer of the amount described in clause

liability associated with the Intercompany Debt outstanding on July 1, 2004.

                  (d) If all Intercompany Debt is not eliminated on or before
the Closing Date, thereafter Seller shall use Seller's best efforts to eliminate
the Intercompany Debt on or before June 30, 2004.

                  (e) Buyer will cooperate with Seller as reasonably requested
by Seller to eliminate the Intercompany Debt by June 30, 2004.

                  (f) This Section 7.10(f) shall survive the Closing.

         Section 7.11 Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer each agree that from
time to time after the Closing Date, they will execute and deliver, and will

instruments, and take, and cause their respective Affiliates to take such other
action, as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

                          INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES

         Section 10.1 Survival. Subject to the limitations and other provisions
of this Agreement: (a) the representations and warranties of the parties hereto
contained in this Agreement and the covenants and agreements of the parties
hereto contained in ARTICLE VI of this Agreement which by their terms are
required to be performed on or before the Closing (the "Pre-Closing Covenants")
shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect for a period
of 15 months after the Closing Date; provided that, with respect to the
representations set forth in Section 4.14, such representations shall survive
for a period of five years after the Closing Date, and (b) each covenant and
agreement of the parties hereto contained in Section 2.5 and ARTICLE VII and
ARTICLE X (except as provided in clause (b) preceding) of this Agreement which
by its terms requires performance after the Closing Date (a "Post-Closing
Covenant") shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and effect
until such covenant or agreement is fully performed. For the avoidance of doubt,
the survival of the indemnification obligations in ARTICLE X shall not be deemed
to extend the time for making a Claim for breach of the representations and
warranties of the parties hereto or for breach of the covenants contained in
ARTICLE VI, as provided in Section 10.1(a) above.

                  (e) For purposes of determining if a breach of a
representation or warranty qualified by Material Adverse Effect in this
Agreement has occurred, the Material Adverse Effect qualifier shall apply;

         Section 10.5 Indemnification Procedures; Matters Involving Third
Parties.

                  (a) A Seller Indemnitee or Buyer Indemnitee, as the case may
be (for purposes of this Section 10.5, an "Indemnified Party"), shall give the
indemnifying party under Section 10.2, Section 10.3 or Section 10.4, as
applicable (for purposes of this Section 10.5, an "Indemnifying Party"), prompt
written notice of any matter which it has determined has given or could give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement stating the amount of
the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, containing a reference to
the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its
obligations under this ARTICLE X except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

                  (b) If any third party shall notify an Indemnified Party with
respect to any matter (a "Third-Party Claim") that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against the Indemnifying Party under this ARTICLE X, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly (and in any event within five Business Days
after receiving notice of the Third-Party Claim) notify the Indemnifying Party
thereof in writing; provided, however, that the failure to provide such notice
shall not release the Indemnifying Party from its obligations under this ARTICLE
X except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure.

                  (c) The Indemnifying Party will have the right to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of money damages for
which the Indemnifying Party is liable hereunder and does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party.

                  (d) Unless and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of the Third-Party Claim as provided in Section 10.5(c), however, the
Indemnified Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner it may
reasonably deem appropriate.

<PAGE>


                  (e) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(not to be withheld unreasonably).

         Section 10.6 Determination of Losses.

                  (a) The Losses giving rise to any indemnification obligation
hereunder shall be limited to the actual loss suffered by the Indemnified Party
(i.e., reduced by any insurance proceeds or other payment or recoupment
received, realized or retained by the Indemnified Party from any third party
insurance provider (excluding any captive insurance company Affiliate of the
Indemnified Party) as a result of the events giving rise to the claim for
indemnification, net of any expenses related to the receipt of such proceeds,
payment or recoupment, including retrospective premium adjustments, if any. The
amount of the actual loss and the amount of the indemnity payment shall be
computed by taking into account the timing of the loss or payment, as
applicable, using the Applicable Rate, as appropriate. Upon the request of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party
with information sufficient to allow the Indemnifying Party to calculate the
amount of the indemnity payment in accordance with this Section 10.6. An
Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps to mitigate damages in respect
of any claim for which it is seeking indemnification and shall use reasonable
efforts to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such
costs and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

                  (b) Any and all payments due pursuant to this ARTICLE X will
be (i) increased by an amount equal to any Additional Net Taxes (provided that
no such increase will be made with respect to any Additional Net Tax owed as a
result of receiving a payment under this clause (i)), and (ii) decreased in an
amount equal to the Net Tax Benefit. Additional Net Taxes is equal to the
greater of (A) all Taxes actually owed by the Indemnified Party as a result of
the inclusion of such payment in gross income under the Tax laws of any
jurisdiction or (B) the product of (x) the highest tax rate applicable in any
jurisdiction (taking into account that the applicable rate may be zero) in which
the gross income is recognized multiplied by (y) the amount of payments due
pursuant to this Article X. The Net Tax Benefit is equal to the greater of (A)
the reduction in Taxes actually recognized by the Indemnified Party as a result
of a deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance under the
Tax laws of any jurisdiction or (B) the product of (x) the highest tax rate
applicable in any jurisdiction (taking into account that the applicable rate may
be zero) which the deduction, amortization, or exclusion from income is
recognized multiplied by (y) the amount of the deduction, amortization, or
exclusion from income. Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless a final
determination (which shall include the execution of a closing agreement) with
respect to the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates causes any such
payment not to be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

Agreement, no party hereto shall be entitled to recover from any other party
hereto any amount in respect of exemplary, punitive, special, indirect,
consequential, remote, or speculative damages, including lost profits; provided
that if (x) an Indemnified Party has become liable to a third party for amounts
constituting such types of damages and (y) such Indemnified Party would be
entitled to indemnification for such amounts under this Article X but for the
limitation set forth in this Section 9.2, such Indemnified Party will be
entitled to recover such damages from the Indemnifying Party.

                  (c) ALL RELEASES, DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY, AND
