iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of November 19,
2006, by and among Actelion US Holding Company, a Delaware corporation ("
_Parent_ "), Curl Acquisition Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and CoTherix, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective stockholders to consummate the merger of
Purchaser with and into the Company on the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement (the " _Merger_ ") whereby each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_
"), other than any Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or the
Company (or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries) and the Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder in Purchaser, has approved the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, it is
proposed that Purchaser commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire
all the outstanding Company Common Stock at a price of Thirteen Dollars and
Fifty Cents ($13.50), in cash (such amount, or any different amount per share
of Company Common Stock that may be paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance
with the terms hereof, being hereinafter referred to as the " _Offer Price_
"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

WHEREAS, Parent, Purchaser and the Company, desire to make those
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, the
stockholders of the Company set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto have entered into
Tender and Voting Agreements (collectively, the " _Tender Agreements_ ") in
the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of and reliance upon the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company agree as follows: ARTICLE I

The Offer

1.1 _The Offer_.

(a) _Tender Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE X_ , Parent shall cause Purchaser
to (i) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) as promptly as practicable
(and, in any event, no later than December 8, 2006) after the date of this
Agreement, an offer to purchase all outstanding Company Shares at the Offer
Price, (ii) within the same time period specified in subclause (i) and after
affording the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,
file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and all other necessary documents
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), make all
deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, and publish, send or give the disclosure required by Rule 14d-6
under the Exchange Act by complying with the dissemination requirements of
Rule 14d-4 under the Exchange Act, in each case in connection with the Offer
(collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and (iii) use reasonable efforts to consummate the Offer,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof. Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE X_ , the obligation
of Purchaser to accept for payment or pay for any Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer will be subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Annex I hereto (the " _Tender Offer Conditions_ "). As used in this
Agreement (including the Tender Offer Conditions), the term " _Minimum
Condition_ " means the condition that the Company Shares validly tendered in
accordance with the terms of the Offer and not withdrawn, together with any
Company Shares then owned by Parent and/or Purchaser, constitute a majority of
the Adjusted Outstanding Shares. " _Adjusted Outstanding Shares_ " means (i)
the number of Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the acceptance
of Company Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, without giving effect to
any Company Shares owned by the Company, plus, at the election of Parent,
(ii) an additional number of Company Shares determined by Parent in its sole
discretion up to but not exceeding the aggregate number of Company Shares
issuable upon the exercise of (x) all Company Options, (y) rights to acquire
Company Shares under the Company ESPP based upon amounts accumulated under the
Company ESPP and not withdrawn by participants thereof and (z) other rights to
acquire Company Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to
the acceptance of Company Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer.

(b) _Conditions of Tender Offer_. Without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not decrease the Offer Price or change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought to be
purchased in the Offer, waive the Minimum Condition, impose additional
conditions to the Offer or amend any other term of the Offer in any manner
adverse to the holders of Shares. The Offer shall remain open until the date
that is twenty (20) business days (as such term is defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer (the "
_Expiration Date_ "), unless Purchaser shall have extended the period of time
for which the Offer is open pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of
this Agreement or as may be required by applicable law, in which event the



 

2 term "Expiration Date" means the latest time and date as the Offer, as so
extended, may expire. Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement
and the satisfaction of all the Tender Offer Conditions as of any Expiration
Date, Purchaser will accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable after such Expiration Date. Unless this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ , Purchaser shall extend the Offer for
successive extension periods not in excess of ten (10) Business Days per
extension if, at any Expiration Date or any extension thereof, any of the
conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such
time as such conditions are satisfied or waived, and Purchaser may extend the
Offer if and to the extent required by the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC; provided, however, Purchaser shall not be required to extend the
Offer to end on a date after the Termination Date. Purchaser may, but shall
not be required to, provide a subsequent offering period after the Expiration
Date, in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act.

(c) _Offer Documents_. Parent agrees that the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that no representation or warranty is made
by Parent or Purchaser with respect to information supplied by the Company or
any of its officers, directors, representatives, agents or employees in
writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents. The Company hereby agrees that the information provided by it or
any of its officers, directors, representatives agents or employees in writing
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect. Parent and Purchaser shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as amended to reflect such corrected
information, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company
Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and
its counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser
shall provide in writing to the Company and its counsel any written comments
Parent and Purchaser or their counsel may receive in writing from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly upon receipt thereof,
and Parent and Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any written response to any such written
comments of the SEC or its staff.

1.2 _Company Actions_.

than ten (10) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, and including all exhibits thereto,

reasonably practicable, the Schedule 14D-9 shall be filed with the SEC



 

3 concurrently with the filing by Parent and Purchaser of the Schedule TO and

dissemination of the Offer Documents). Subject to the provisions of _Section
8.3_, the Schedule 14D-9 shall include a description of the determinations,
approvals and recommendations of the Company Board set forth in _Section
6.3(b)_, and shall include such determinations, approvals and recommendations.
Each of Parent and Purchaser shall promptly furnish to the Company in writing
upon request all information concerning Parent and Purchaser that may be
required by applicable securities laws or reasonably requested by the Company
for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply in all material respects with the Exchange Act and all other
requirements of Law. The Company further agrees that the Schedule 14D-9 shall
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no representation or warranty is
made by the Company with respect to information supplied by Parent or
Purchaser or any of their officers, directors, representatives, agents or
employees in writing specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser hereby agree that the information
provided by them specifically in writing for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the Company,
Parent and Purchaser shall promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect. The Company shall
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as amended to reflect
such corrected information, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company Stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall provide in writing
to Parent, Purchaser and their counsel any written comments the Company or its
counsel may receive in writing from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly upon receipt thereof, and the Company shall provide
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment on any
written response to any such written comments of the SEC or its staff.

(b) _Company Information_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or
shall cause its transfer agent to, promptly following a request by Parent,
furnish Parent at Parents sole cost and expense with such information as
Parent or its agents may reasonably request in order to disseminate and
otherwise communicate the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Company Shares, including a list, as of the most recent practicable date, of
the Company Stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer
files containing the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders
of Company Shares, and lists of security positions of Company Shares held in
stock depositories (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels,
listings or files of securities positions). Subject to any and all
requirements of Law, and except for such steps as are necessary to
disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to
consummate the Merger, Parent and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their
respective officers, directors, agents, representatives, employees, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors to):

(i) hold in confidence the information contained in any such lists of
stockholders, mailing labels and listings or files of securities positions on
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement;



 

4 (ii) use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger;
and

(iii) if (A) this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to _ARTICLE X_ and/or
(B) Parent and Purchaser shall withdraw the Offer, upon the Companys
request, deliver (and shall use their respective reasonable efforts to cause
their agents to deliver) to the Company any and all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control. 

1.3 _Directors_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable law, promptly upon (i) the payment
by Purchaser pursuant to the Offer for Company Shares representing at least
such number of Shares as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition, and (ii) the
written request of Parent, and from time to time thereafter, Parent shall be
entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole
number, on the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of
directors on the Company Board (determined after giving effect to the
directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that
the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any of its
Affiliates bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding, and the
Company shall, upon request of Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to
cause Parents designees to be so elected, including, if necessary, seeking
the resignations of one or more existing directors; provided, however, that
prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall always have at least two
Continuing Directors.

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under
this _Section 1.3_ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information
with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required
under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its obligations under this
_Section 1.3_. Parent will supply to the Company any information with respect
to itself, Purchaser, their respective officers, directors and affiliates and
proposed designees to the Company Board required by such Section and Rule,
and the Company shall include such information in the Schedule 14D-9.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees to the
Company Board pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ (the "Appointment Time") and
prior to the Effective Time, any Adverse Matter shall require, in addition to
any other affirmative votes required under the DGCL, the affirmative vote of
not less than a majority of the entire Company Board, which majority shall
include the concurrence of a majority of the Continuing Directors; provided,
however, that if the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 1.3(c)_ are
invalid or incapable of being enforced under applicable law, then neither
Parent nor Purchaser shall approve (either in its capacity as a stockholder or
as a party to this Agreement, as applicable), and Parent and Purchaser shall
use their reasonable efforts to prevent the occurrence of such action unless
such



 

5 actions shall have received the unanimous approval of the entire Company
Board. For purposes of this  _Section 1.3(c)_, an " _Adverse Matter_ " means
any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension
by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, or any waiver of any condition
to the Companys obligations or rights hereunder, if such amendment,
termination, extension or waiver would be reasonably likely to have an adverse
effect on the stockholders of the Company other than Purchaser or its
affiliates. For purposes of this _Section 1.3_, the term " _Continuing
Directors_ " means any directors of the Company then serving, if any, who are
directors as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section 1.3_, the parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to ensure that at least two of the members of the Company Board shall,
at all times prior to the Effective Time, be Continuing Directors, provided
that, if there shall be in office fewer than two Continuing Directors for any
reason, the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Board to cause the person designated by the remaining
Continuing Director to fill such vacancy, which person shall be deemed to be
a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing
Directors then remain, the other directors of the Company then in office shall
designate two persons to fill such vacancies who will not be directors,
officers, employees or affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such persons
shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.
The Company Board shall not delegate any Adverse Matter to any committee of
the Company Board unless such committee consists only of Continuing Directors.

1.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to Purchaser an irrevocable option
(the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only on or after Purchasers
acceptance of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the date and time of such
acceptance, the " _Acceptance Time_ "), to purchase that number of Company
Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Company
Shares that, when added to the number of Company Shares owned by Purchaser at
the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the
Company Shares then outstanding (assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares) at a price per share equal to the Offer Price.

(b) Purchaser may exercise the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part,
at any one time after the occurrence of a Top-Up Exercise Event and prior to
the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Top-Up Exercise
Event_ " shall occur only upon Purchasers acceptance of Company Shares for
payment pursuant to the Offer and/or other acquisition of Company Shares
constituting at least 85% of the Company Shares then outstanding.

Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;

Exchange of Certificates

5.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, on the terms and subject
to the conditions herein set forth, as a result of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company Shares (i) owned
by Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (collectively, the "
_Parent Companies_ "), (ii) owned by the Company, or (iii) Company Shares
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are owned by stockholders (the "
_Dissenting Stockholders_ ") properly exercising appraisal rights pursuant to
_Section 262_ of the DGCL (each, an " _Excluded Company Share_ " and
collectively, " _Excluded Company Shares_ ")) shall be converted automatically
into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all Company Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and all Company Shares shall be cancelled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ")
formerly representing any such shares of Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Company Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to the
Merger Consideration and any Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in _Section 5.3_.

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Company Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of the
Parent Companies, the Company (in each case, other than such Company Shares
that are held on behalf of third parties) shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Purchaser_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

5.2 _Exchange of Certificates for Shares_.

(a) _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, (a) all
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and all
holders of certificates representing Company Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company; and (b) the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed with respect to all Company Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. At or after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the



 

8 Company of the Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for a check in the proper amount pursuant to this _ARTICLE V_.

(b) _Paying Agent_. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall timely
deposit, or shall cause to be timely deposited, with a paying agent appointed
by Parent and approved in advance by the Company (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for
the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, cash sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange for Company Shares for which
the Certificates have been duly surrendered to the Paying Agent from time to
time, pursuant to the provisions of this _ARTICLE V_.

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
no later than two (2) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Shares (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon the surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) of
(x) the number of shares of Common Stock represented by such Certificate
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Share that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of
the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
representing such Company Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and
upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) of the number of Company Shares represented by such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Merger Consideration upon due
surrender of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate being surrendered. Any
affidavit of loss presented pursuant to this _ARTICLE V_ , to be deemed
effective, must be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Surviving Corporation.

5.3 _Dissenters  Rights_. Any Person who otherwise would be deemed a
Dissenting Stockholder shall not be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration with respect to the Company Shares owned by such Person unless
and until such Person shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such holders right to dissent from the Merger under the
DGCL. Each Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided



 

9 by _Section 262_ of the DGCL with respect to Company Shares owned by such
Dissenting Stockholder. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the
Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any
such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

5.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Company Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for Company Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change.

5.5 _Treatment of Options, Stock-Based Awards and ESPP_.

(a) On the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each stock option to purchase Company Shares
(each, a " _Company Option_ ") then outstanding shall (i) if unvested, become
fully vested and (ii) to the extent the exercise price thereof per Company
Share is less than the Merger Consideration, be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (x) the
total number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option multiplied
by (y) the excess of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per Company Share under such Company Option (with the aggregate amount
of such payment rounded to the nearest cent), less applicable Taxes, if any,
required to be withheld with respect to such payment. Each Company Option
whose exercise price per Company Share is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be cancelled effective on the Effective Time without any
consideration or obligation on account of such cancellation.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive Company Shares or benefits measured by the
value of a number of Company Shares, and each award of any kind consisting of
Company Shares, granted under the Company Stock Plans as set forth in Section
6.2(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter or under any individual
consultant, employee or director agreement pursuant to such Company Stock
Plans, including any restricted stock, restricted stock units or rights,
deferred stock units and dividend equivalents, other than Company Options and
any rights to acquire Company Shares under the Company ESPP (each, a "
_Company Stock-Based Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
and shall entitle the holder thereof to receive, as soon as practicable
thereafter (but in any event within two (2) Business Days following the
Effective Time), an amount in cash (without interest) on a per Company Share
or equivalent basis equal to the Merger Consideration, subject to any
deferred election in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time made by
such holder under the Companys deferred compensation plans, less applicable
Taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. The
Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Company Stock Plans shall
terminate immediately prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the date
on which the Company Stock Plans terminate by their terms.



 

10 (c) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP,
and shall, if necessary, amend the company ESPP to (i) provide that no
Participant (as that term is defined in the Company ESPP) may increase the
rate of his or her contributions to the Company ESPP above the rate in effect
on November 17, 2006, and that no Eligible Employee who had not elected on or
before November 16, 2006 to make contributions to the Company ESPP with
respect to the Offering Period, as defined in the Company ESPP, commencing on
November 16, 2006 shall be permitted to make further contributions to the
Company ESPP, (ii) shorten each then currently ongoing purchase and/or
offering period under the Company ESPP that extends beyond the Effective Time
(the " _Current Offerings_ ") such that a new purchase date for each such
Current Offering shall occur no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the
Effective Time and Company Shares shall be purchased by the Company ESPP
participants no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Effective Time
and (iii) prevent a new purchase or offering period from commencing after such
new purchase date. The Company shall take all actions necessary so that the
Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior to the earlier of (A) the
Effective Time and (B) the date upon which the Company ESPP terminates by its
terms.

its properties or assets or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good
standing) or to have such power or authority, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has heretofore delivered or made available to Parent
accurate and complete copies of the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the " _Restated Charter_ ") and the Companys



 

11 Amended and Restated Bylaws (the " _Restated Bylaws_ "), and all such

known material prior art in connection with the prosecution of patent
applications with respect to any such Patent) nor based on the Companys

Closing to the same extent as they are exercisable by the Company prior to
the Closing. No licensor under any Licensed-In Agreement has any ownership or
exclusive license rights in or with respect to any improvements made by the
Company to the Licensed-In Intellectual Property.

or license under or with respect to Intellectual Property of a third party
and the terms of all licenses of Intellectual Property by the Company, to the

negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates
and their respective Representatives) relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or

(y) at any time prior to, but not after, the conditions set forth in _Section
9.1(a)_ have been satisfied, (A) providing information in response to a
request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal (assuming, for this purpose only that all
references to "15% or more" in the definition of such term were changed to "a
majority") which did not result from a breach of this _Section 8.2_ (a "
_Qualifying Acquisition Proposal_ ") if the Company receives from the Person
so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on terms
substantially similar to the Confidentiality Agreement; (B) engaging in any
negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made a Qualified
Acquisition Proposal if the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement as described in (A) above; or (C) approving or
recommending a Qualified Acquisition Proposal to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case, if and only to the extent that, (I) in each such case
referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Company Board determines in
good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to
take such action would constitute a breach of the Company directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (II) in each case referred to in clause (B) or
(C) above, the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with the Companys financial advisor and outside counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes an Acquisition Proposal that, if accepted, is
reasonably likely to be consummated taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory (including, without limitation, any antitrust or competition
approvals or non-objections) and other relevant factors and, if consummated in
accordance with its terms, is reasonably likely to result in a more favorable
transaction than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (any such more
favorable Acquisition Proposal is referred to in this Agreement as a "
_Superior Proposal_ "); and (III) in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, the
Company shall have provided written notice to Parent of the Companys or the
Company Boards intention to take such action, at least one (1) Business Day
notice in the case of clause (B) and at least five (5) Business Days, notice
in the case of clause (C) prior to taking such action.

(b) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company will promptly request each Person that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with its consideration of a
transaction with the Company to return or destroy all confidential information



 

38 furnished prior to the execution of this Agreement to or for the benefit of
such Person by or on behalf of the Company and to destroy all summaries,
analyses or extracts of or based upon such information in the possession of
such Person or any of its Representatives. The Company agrees that it will
take the necessary steps to promptly inform its Representatives of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 8.2(b)_. The Company will not waive
any provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a
party without the prior written consent of Parent except in connection
with action otherwise expressly permitted by clause (B) or (C) of Section
8.2(a), solely with respect to the Person making the Superior Proposal.

(c) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any case within one (1) Business Day if any bona fide
written Acquisition Proposals are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated with, it or any of its Representatives, indicating, in connection
with such notice, the material terms and conditions of, and the identity of
the Person making, such bona fide written Acquisition Proposals, and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any significant changes in
the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposals. The Company will
provide to Parent any information that it is providing to any other Person
pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ at the same time it provides it to such other
Person, unless such information has already been provided to Parent. The
Company agrees that during the five- and two-Business Day periods described
in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _8.3_ , the Company shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent with respect to any revisions to the terms of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent. Any such revisions which
Parent offers in writing to make which, if accepted by the Company, would be
legally binding on the parties to this Agreement are referred to herein as "
_Revised Terms_ ". The Company agrees that any material amendment to any
Qualifying Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Qualifying
Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this _Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_,
provided that the five (5) Business Day period applicable under this _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_ to any Persons initial Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal shall be two (2) Business Days (but shall in no case end before the
fifth (5th) Business Day from such Persons initial Qualifying Acquisition
Proposal) with respect to any material amendment to such Persons initial or
previous Qualifying Acquisition Proposal.

8.3 _Board Recommendation_. The Company Board shall not withdraw, qualify or
modify the Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent, or approve or
recommend another Acquisition Proposal (collectively, a " _Change in
Recommendation_ "), unless: (i) the Company shall have provided written
notice to Parent that the Company Board intends to take such action, at least
five (5) Business Days shall have elapsed since the date on which Parent
received such notice and the Company shall have complied with the
applicable provisions of _Section 8.2_, (ii) the Company Board shall have
determined in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel and
taking into account any Revised Terms, that failing to take such action would
be a breach by the directors of the Company of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (iii) if the Change In Recommendation is being made
primarily as a result of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal is
a Superior Proposal (it being agreed and understood by the parties that any
Change In Recommendation shall not alter the Company Boards approval of the
Transactions (including for purposes of Section 203 of the DGCL)).



 

39 8.4 _Stockholder Meeting; Proxy Material_.

(a) If approval of the Company Stockholders is required under Delaware Law in
order to consummate the Merger (other than pursuant to Section 253 of the
DGCL), the Company shall duly call and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to hold a meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the approval of this Agreement and
the Merger by the Company Stockholders required to satisfy the conditions set
forth in _Section 9.1(a)_ as promptly as practicable after the SEC clears the

other materials for meetings such as the Company Stockholders Meeting; (v) to
the extent required by applicable Law, as promptly as reasonably practicable
prepare, file and distribute to the Company Stockholders any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Materials if any event shall occur which requires such
action at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting; and (vi)
otherwise comply with all requirements of Law applicable to the Company
Stockholders Meeting and the Merger. The Company will provide Parent and
Purchaser an opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Materials, or
any amendments or supplements thereto, or any SEC comments received with
respect thereto, prior to filing the same with the SEC.

(b) Subject to the fiduciary duties of the Company Board, the Recommendation
of the Company Board shall be included in the Proxy Materials, and the Company
Board shall take all lawful action to solicit the adoption of this Agreement
by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock. Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall vote all Company Shares acquired in the Offer (or otherwise
beneficially owned by it or any of its respective Subsidiaries as of the
applicable record date) in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in
accordance with the DGCL at the Company Stockholders Meeting or otherwise.

owned by it in favor of the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
Delaware Law. 

(c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, if Purchaser shall own by
virtue of the Offer or otherwise at least 90% of the outstanding Company
Shares, the parties hereto shall take all necessary actions (including actions
referred to in clause (a) above, as applicable) to cause the Merger to become
effective, as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer, as it
may be extended in accordance with the requirements of Section 1.1(b) hereof,
without a meeting of the Company Stockholders, in accordance with Section 253
of the DGCL.

additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in
connection with obtaining any requisite approvals, consents, orders,
exemptions or waivers by any third party or Governmental Entity; (iii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth in
_ARTICLE IX_ ; and (iv) the execution of any additional instruments,

Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent each shall promptly
furnish the other with copies of notices or other communications between
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, and any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions

Company Material Adverse Effect or of any failure of any condition to Parents
obligations to effect the Merger, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the
Company of any change, fact or condition that is reasonably likely to result

respect to the transactions contemplated hereby without giving the other party
hereto prior notice of the

and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or

information, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall afford Parent or any of

periods with the Company (and its respective predecessors) before the
Effective Time under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its affiliates
(other than the Company) after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ ") for
purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual)
to the same extent as such



 

42 Affected Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any comparable Benefit Plans (except to the extent such credit
would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits).

(b) Without limiting the generality of  _Section 11.7_, nothing herein
expressed or implied shall confer upon any Affected Employee or any other
current or former employee of the Company or upon any representative of any
such person, or upon any collective bargaining agent, any rights or remedies,

continued employment for any specified period, or any right to employment upon

other Benefit Plan of the Company which is intended to include an arrangement

of the Effective Date or such other date as Parent may designate to the
Company in writing, the Company shall terminate all other Benefit Plans which
Parent identifies to the Company a reasonable period prior to the Closing.
Prior to the date on which Parent or Purchaser would become an ERISA Affiliate
of the Company (with respect to the 401(k) Plans) and the Closing (with
respect to other Benefit Plans), the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that the 401(k) Plans and such other Benefit Plans identified by

list of employees of the Company to whom it desires to offer employment
or continuing employment following the Closing. The Company shall provide a
notice of termination to all employees of the Company not so designated by
Parent and to Governmental Entities, each as required by applicable state and
federal Laws, including but not limited to those required by the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the " _WARN Act_ "). The proposed
forms of such notice and a schedule of all WARN Act-related payments shall be
provided to Parent not less than five (5) Business Days prior to dispatch for
Parents review and approval.

(a) The indemnification, advancement and exculpation provisions of the
Restated Certificate, the Restated Bylaws and those certain Indemnification
Agreements by and among the Company and its directors and certain executive
officers, as in effect at the Effective Time shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals
who at the Effective Time were directors, officers or employees of the
Company. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with all such
indemnification, advancement and exculpation provisions.



 

43 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") (including for acts or omissions
occurring in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) covering each Person covered as of the
Effective Time by the Companys officers and directors liability insurance
policy (each such Person, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") on terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence,
in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one
(1) year an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance (such 250% amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_
"); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
the Maximum Annual Premium. The Company may and, at Parents request, the
Company will, instead purchase a six (6)-year "tail" prepaid policy prior to
the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than the existing directors and officers liability
insurance maintained by the Company; provided, that the amount paid by the
Company shall not exceed three times the Maximum Annual Premium. If such
"tail" prepaid policies have been obtained by the Company prior to the
Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue
to honor the respective obligations thereunder, and all other obligations
under this _Section 8.10(b)_ shall terminate.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then the obligations of Parent or the Surviving Company,
as the case may be, that are set forth under this _Section 8.10_ shall
survive, and to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 8.10_. Parent
shall be responsible for any breach by the Surviving Company of the provisions
of this _Section 8.10_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 8.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and legal representatives.

8.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board (or any other appropriate committee of the
Company Board) shall grant all approvals and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take all actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such Takeover Statute on such transactions.



8.12 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Actelion Ltd. and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, dated as of October 4, 2006 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),

ARTICLE X

Termination

10.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Offer and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time by mutual written consent of the Company (by action of the Company
Board), and Parent (by action of its Board of Directors).

10.2 _Termination by Either Parent or the Company_. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Offer and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time by Parent (by action of its Board of Directors) or by the
Company (by action of the Company Board), if (a) Purchaser shall not have
accepted for payment any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer by May 31, 2007
(as such date may be extended pursuant to the proviso below, the "
_Termination Date_ "); or (b) any Injunction permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger shall become
final and non-appealable; _provided_ , however, that in the event that the
condition set forth in clause (A) of the first paragraph of Annex I shall not
have been satisfied on or prior to the Termination Date, but all other Tender
Offer Conditions have been satisfied (or are capable of being satisfied in
connection with an acceptance of tendered shares), the Company or Parent may
elect to extend



 

45 the Termination Date, by written notice to the other parties on or prior to
the Termination Date, until July 30, 2007; and provided further, that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.2(a)_ shall
not be available to any party if the circumstances described in this _Section
10.2_ were caused by such partys material breach of its obligations
hereunder.

10.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Offer and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, by action of the Company Board;

(a) if there has been a breach of any representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements made by Parent or Purchaser in this Agreement, or any such
representations and warranties shall have become untrue or incorrect as of the
Expiration Date, such that such breach or failure to be true and correct is
not reasonably likely to be curable by the Termination Date and, if not cured,
is reasonably likely to prevent Parent and Purchaser from accepting for
payment or paying for Company Shares pursuant to the Offer or consummating
the Merger in accordance with the terms hereof; or

(b) at any time prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment of Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer, in order for the Company to enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal if (i) the Company has not
materially breached _Section 8.2_, (ii) the Company Board has authorized the
Company to enter into a definitive agreement for such Superior Proposal,
(iii) prior to or simultaneously with and as a condition of the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.3(b)_, the Company shall have
irrevocably paid (or caused to be paid) to Parent the Termination Fee payable
pursuant to _Section 10.5(d)_ by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

10.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer
and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, by
action of the Board of Directors of Parent

(a) if the Company Board shall have withdrawn, qualified or modified the
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent; or

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue or incorrect after the
execution of this Agreement, such that (i) the condition set forth in any of
clause (1), (2) or (3) of the Tender Offer Conditions would not be satisfied
and (ii) such breach or failure to be true or correct is not reasonably
likely to be curable by the Termination Date; or

(c) the Company shall have materially breached any of its obligations under
_Section 8.2_ or _8.3_.

10.5 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Termination Fee_.

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to this _ARTICLE X_ , this Agreement (other than the
Companys obligation pursuant to this _Section 10.5_, if applicable) shall
become void and of no effect with no liability



 

46 on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , that, except as otherwise provided
herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages resulting from any willful breach of this Agreement.

(b) In the event that any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
its termination a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (assuming, for this purpose
only, that all references to "15%" in the definition of such term were changed
to "a majority" (a " _Covered Proposal_ ")) shall have been made to the
Company or any of its stockholders or any Person shall have publicly
announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make a Covered Proposal
with respect to the Company and thereafter this Agreement is rightfully
terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section 10.2(a)_ or
by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.4(b)_ (except where the only basis of such
termination by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.4(b) _is the existence of a
Company Material Adverse Effect whose existence is outside the reasonable
control of the Company) (and such Covered Proposal shall not have been
publicly withdrawn at least 14 days prior to such termination), then if the
Company (I) consummates any Covered Proposal with any Person within
the twelve-month period immediately following the date on which this
Agreement has been so terminated (the " _Tail Period_ ") or (II) enters into a
definitive agreement for any Covered Proposal with any Person during the Tail
Period and (x) consummates any Covered Proposal with any Person within the
twelve-month period immediately following the end of the Tail Period, then in
each such case the Company shall pay to Parent on or prior to such
consummation of such Covered Proposal by wire transfer of immediately
available funds a termination fee equal to $14,000,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ").

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.4(a)_ or _Section 10.4(c)_, then the Company shall promptly, but
in no event later than two days after the date of such termination, pay to
Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(d) In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.3(b)_, the Company shall pay to Parent the Termination Fee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds as provided in _Section
10.3(b)_.

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in _Section
10.5(b)_, _Section 10.5(c)_ and _Section 10.5(d)_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant
to  _Section 10.5(b)_, _Section 10.5(c)_ or _Section 10.5(d)_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a
judgment against the Company for such amounts, the Company shall pay to
Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with
such suit and any amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section
10.5_ which are not paid when due shall bear interest from the due date to the
payment date at a rate per annum equal to 2% above the prime rate of Citibank
N.A. in effect on the date such amounts were due.
