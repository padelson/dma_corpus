shall this sentence affect a Partys obligation to effect the Closing when

exclusive remedy with respect to, and the sole right to dispute, the
Estimated Closing Statement (and any determinations or calculations contained
therein) shall be as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_). Notwithstanding

facility contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments is unavailable to be
funded on the Closing or insufficient (after taking into account any other
borrowings on the Closing Date) to fund a portion of the Redemption Price up
to an amount equal to the estimated Closing Cash, the portion of (but only
such portion of) the Redemption Price representing the estimated Closing Cash

(viii) to each Non-US Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds

portion of the Dory Non-US Acquisition Purchase Price set forth on the

The Seller Representative shall provide Buyer with a flow of funds setting

shall be calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, along with wire instructions therefor at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Funds Flow_ "). The payments pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ (as adjusted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_)
shall be deemed to reflect the agreement of Parties as to the value of the
Acquired Equity Securities and the Dory Parent Common Shares set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 1.1(a) of the Seller Schedules_ redeemed pursuant to the
Redemption immediately prior to the Closing.

 

At the Closing, Steiner Leisure shall deliver to the Escrow Agent the
Indemnity Escrow Shares to be held in the Indemnity Escrow Account.

 

(b) _Determination of Final Purchase Price_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than sixty days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers good faith
determination of the actual amounts of Closing Working Capital, the Net
Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness and Company
Expenses, together with a calculation of the Purchase Price based thereon, in
each case, including reasonably detailed calculations of the components
thereof. The Closing Statement and the determinations and
calculations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including the Accounting Principles.

(ii) Within forty-five days following receipt by the Seller Representative of
the Closing Statement (the " _Seller Review Period_ "), the Seller
Representative may deliver a written notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to
Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of the
Closing Statement. Such Objection Notice shall (to the extent that Buyer has
complied with (or been relieved of) its obligations under _Section 2.3(c)_ or
the Seller Representative otherwise has possession of any such information or
reasonable access to any such information from any of its Affiliates or its or
their advisors) describe in reasonable detail the items contained in the
Closing Statement with which the Seller Representative disagrees; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Objection Notice shall include only objections (A)
based on the failure of the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement to
be prepared in a manner consistent with this Agreement or the Accounting
Principles or mathematical errors in the computation of any amount set forth
in the Closing Statement, or (B) on the basis that the Seller Representative
(to the extent that Buyer has not complied with (nor been relieved of) its
obligations under _Section 2.3(c)_ and the Seller Representative does not
otherwise have possession of such information or reasonable access to such
information from any of its Affiliates or its or their advisors) has not been
provided with adequate information to understand and evaluate the differences
between the calculations contained in the Estimated Closing Statement, on the
one hand, and the calculations contained in the 

 



38

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 Closing Statement (and/or components thereof), on the other hand, pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(c)_. Any amount, determination or calculation contained
in the Closing Statement and not specifically disputed in a timely delivered
Objection Notice shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If the
Seller Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with respect
to the Closing Statement within such forty-five day period, the Closing
Statement will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. If an
Objection Notice is timely delivered within such forty-five day period, Buyer
and the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each
dispute raised therein (each, an " _Objection_ "). The Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 and any similar state rules
shall apply to the Seller Representative (and any of its Representatives) and
Buyer (and any of its Representatives) during any such negotiations and any
subsequent dispute arising therefrom. If Buyer and the Seller Representative,
notwithstanding such good faith efforts, fail to resolve any
Objections within fifteen Business Days after the Seller Representative
delivers an Objection Notice, then Buyer and the Seller Representative shall
jointly engage the dispute resolution group of BDO USA, LLC or, if such firm
declines to be retained to resolve the dispute, the dispute resolution group
of another internationally-recognized, independent accounting firm reasonably
acceptable to the Seller Representative and Buyer (in either case, the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve such disputes (acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator) in accordance with this Agreement (including the Accounting
Principles) as soon as practicable thereafter. Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Firm
to deliver a written report containing its calculation of the disputed
Objections (which calculation shall be within the range of dispute between the
Closing Statement and the Objection Notice) within the thirty day period
after its engagement. The Accounting Firm shall make a final determination of
each Objection based solely on (A) the definitions and other applicable
provisions of this Agreement (and shall not conduct an independent
investigation), (B) a single written presentation submitted by each of Buyer
and the Seller Representative (which the Accounting Firm shall be instructed
to distribute to Buyer and the Seller Representative upon receipt of both
such presentations) and (C) one written response of Buyer and the Seller
Representative to each such presentation so submitted (which the Accounting
Firm shall be instructed to distribute to Buyer and the Seller Representative
upon receipt of such responses). For the avoidance of doubt, neither Buyer
nor the Seller Representative shall have any _ex_ _parte_ communications with
the Accounting Firm relating to this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ or this
Agreement. All Objections that are resolved between the Parties or are
determined by the Accounting Firm will be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties, absent manifest error or fraud. The costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party ( _i.e._ , Buyer, on the one
hand, or Seller Representative, on the other hand), that assigned an aggregate
amount to items in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from
the amount finally determined by the Accounting Firm (and, if the parties
assigned amounts were equidistant from the amount finally determined, then
such costs and expenses shall be borne equally). For example, if the Seller
Representative challenges the calculation of the Purchase Price contained
in the Closing Statement by an aggregate amount of $100,000, and the
Accounting Firm determines that the Seller Representative has a valid claim
for $60,000 of the $100,000 challenged, then Buyer shall bear one-hundred
percent (100%) of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm and the Seller
Representative shall bear none of such fees and expenses.

(iii) The Parties agree that the procedures set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)_ __ for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Statement (or
the calculations therein) shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving
any such disputes and none of the Parties or any of their Affiliates shall
have any claim against any other Party or their Affiliates in respect thereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this provision shall not prohibit the Seller
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, from instituting litigation
to enforce any final determination of the Purchase Price by the Accounting
Firm pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)(ii)_, or to compel any Party to submit
any dispute arising in connection with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ to the
Accounting Firm pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_, in any court or other tribunal of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 10.15_. The substance of the
Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent a showing of manifest error or fraud. It is the intent of the Parties
to have any final determination of the Purchase Price by the Accounting Firm
proceed in an expeditious manner; _provided_ , _however_ , any deadline or
time period contained herein may be extended or modified by the written
agreement of the Seller Representative and Buyer, and the Parties agree that
the failure of the Accounting Firm to conform to any deadline or time period
contained herein shall not be a basis for seeking to overturn any
determination rendered by the Accounting Firm which otherwise conforms to
the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_.

(c) _Access_. Following the delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement
to Buyer until the Closing, the Sellers shall, and shall cause each Group
Company to, promptly give to the Buyer and its Representatives (and during the
Seller Review Period, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Group Company to,
promptly give to the Seller Representative and its Representatives)
reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business
hours, to the relevant financial records, work papers, supporting
documentation, personnel of the Group Companies and advisors of the Group
Companies (subject to the execution of a customary access letter, if
requested) in order to permit the timely and complete review of, and, in the
case of the Closing Statement only, the resolution of any Objections with
respect to, the Estimated Closing Statement or the Closing Statement, as
applicable. Buyer shall be relieved of its obligations under this _Section_ __
_ 2.3(c)_ to the extent that (i) services pursuant to any Ancillary Document
are required in order to comply with such obligations and (ii) Seller or any
of its Representatives have failed to provide such services pursuant to such
Ancillary Document after Buyer provides the Seller Representative notice of
such failure and a reasonable opportunity to cure.

(d) _Adjustments_.

 

(i) _Payment by Buyer_. If the Purchase Price as finally determined pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") exceeds the
Estimated Purchase Price, then Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Steiner Leisure an amount equal to such excess, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five Business Days after the date on which
the Final Purchase Price is finally determined to the account(s) designated in
writing by the Seller Representative. Buyer and the Seller Representative
shall also deliver a joint written authorization to the Escrow Agent within
such five Business Day

 period instructing the Escrow Agent to release the entire Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Fund to Steiner Leisure to the account designated in writing
by the Seller Representative.

 

(ii) _Payment from Steiner Leisure_. If the Final Purchase Price is less than
the Estimated Purchase Price (the amount by which the Estimated Purchase
Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price, the " _Overage Amount_ "), then (x) if
such Overage Amount is less than or equal to the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Amount, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall deliver a joint
written authorization to the Escrow Agent within five Business Days after the
date on which the Final Purchase Price is determined instructing the Escrow
Agent to release (1) an amount of cash equal to the Overage Amount from the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to Buyer to the account designated in
writing by the Buyer, and (2) the remaining amount of cash in the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, if any, to Steiner Leisure to the account
designated in writing by the Seller Representative; or (y) if such Overage
Amount exceeds the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, (1) Buyer and Seller
Representative shall deliver a joint written authorization to the Escrow
Agent within five Business Days after the date on which the Final Purchase
Price is determined instructing the Escrow Agent to release the entire
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund to Buyer to the account designated in
writing by the Buyer, and (2) Steiner Leisure shall each pay, or cause to be
paid, to Buyer an amount equal to (x) the Overage Amount less (y) the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds
within five Business Days after the date on which the Final Purchase Price is
determined to the account designated in writing by Buyer. For the avoidance of
doubt, any adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.3(b)_ shall also be deemed to be an adjustment to the Redemption Price.

(e) _Accounting Procedures_. The Estimated Closing Statement, the Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall
(subject to _clauses (i)_ through _(iv)_ below) be prepared and calculated on
a consolidated basis for the Group Companies in accordance with GAAP,
consistent with the same accounting principles, practices, procedures,
policies and methods (with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions,
exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the
Group Companies in the preparation of the latest Audited Financials, except
that such statements, calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include
any purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) shall be based on facts
and circumstances as they exist prior to the Closing and shall exclude the
effect of any change in Law or GAAP (or interpretation or enforcement thereof)
or any other act, decision or event occurring on or after the Closing; (iii)
shall follow the defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such
terms are consistent with GAAP; and (iv) shall, in the case of the Closing
Working Capital calculation, be calculated in accordance with the principles
used on _Exhibit K_ (the principles set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.3(e)_,
the " _Accounting Principles_ "). For purposes of any determinations or
calculations of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Closing
Indebtedness and the Company Expenses that involve amounts denominated in
non-U.S. dollars, such amounts shall be converted into U.S. dollars by using
(A) for purposes of the Estimated Closing Statement and the determination of
the Estimated Purchase Price, the exchange rate published in The Wall Street
Journal on the Business Day prior to the delivery of the Estimated Closing
Statement and (B) for all other purposes, the average exchange rate as
published in The Wall Street Journal for each of the three (3) Business Days
ending on the Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

arising under applicable securities Laws or the Governing Documents of Dory
Parent, or Liens granted, or that result from any action, or the failure to
take any action, by the Person to whom such Deferred Shares are issued
pursuant to this Agreement). At all times prior to the issuance or forfeiture
of the Deferred Shares pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, Dory Parent
shall keep available for issuance a sufficient number of unissued Dory Parent
Common Shares to permit Dory Parent to satisfy its issuance obligations set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, shall take all actions required to

there shall be insufficient unissued Dory Parent Common Shares to permit such
reservation and shall not enter into any contract or agreement that is in
conflict with or would cause Dory Parent to violate its obligations under this
sentence. Each Deferred Share Holder that is not party to this Agreement is an
intended third party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

principal amount of such Indebtedness, the outstanding balance as of the date
of this Agreement, and the debtor and the creditor thereof.

 Section 3.5 _Consents and Requisite Governmental Approvals; No Violations_.

Entity) in connection with the execution, delivery or performance by any Group
Company of the Ancillary Documents to which such Group Company is party or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents, except for (i) to the extent necessary, compliance with
and filings under the HSR Act, (ii) compliance with and filings under any
applicable securities Laws, including the Registration Statement / Proxy

materially delay the ability of any Group Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents, and
(iv) those set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(a) of the Seller Schedules_.
Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b) of the Seller Schedules_,
neither the execution, delivery or performance by any Group Company of any
Ancillary Documents to which such Group Company is or will be, as applicable,
a party nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Documents will, directly or indirectly (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) (a) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of any Group Companys Governing Documents, (b)
result in a violation or breach of, or constitute a default or give rise to
any right of termination, cancellation, amendment, modification, suspension,
revocation or acceleration under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of, or the loss of any benefits under, any Material Contract, or Material Real
Property Lease, (c) violate any Order or Law of any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over any Group Company or any of their respective
properties or assets, or (d) result in the creation of any Lien (other than
any Permitted Liens) upon any of the assets of any Group Company, which in
the case of any of _clauses_ __ _ (b)_ through _(d)_ above, would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material
impact on the Group Companies, taken as a whole, or materially delay the
ability of any Group Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which it is or will be a party or
bound.

 

Section 3.6 _Permits_. The Group Companies hold all permits, licenses,
approvals and other authorizations of, and have made all declarations and
filings with, Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses as currently conducted (collectively, the " _Group
Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to hold, have obtained or to
have made such Group Company Permits, as applicable, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Group Companies, taken as a whole. Except as is
not or would not be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Group
Companies, taken as whole, (a) each Group Company Permit is

 



51

 valid and in full force and effect either pursuant to its terms or by
operation of law; (b) each Group Company is in compliance with the terms of
all Group Company Permits held by such Group Company (and, since December 31,
2015, no Group Company has received written notice from any Governmental
Entity regarding any actual or alleged failure to be in compliance); and (c)
to Sellers knowledge, no event, circumstance, or state of facts has occurred
which (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) would reasonably
be expected to result in the failure of a Group Company to be in compliance
with the terms of any Group Company Permit. No Governmental Entity has
commenced (to Sellers knowledge) or given written notice to any Group Company
that it intends to commence, a proceeding to terminate, cancel, amend,
materially modify, revoke or suspend any Group Company Permit, or given
written notice to any Group Company that it intends not to renew any Group
Company Permit upon expiration thereof, except (in each case) as would not be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Group Companies, taken as a
whole.

Section 5.3  _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Assuming the truth and
accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in _Section_ __ _
3.5_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ (and assuming all Consents referred to in such
Sections (or required to be disclosed in the corresponding sections of the
Seller Schedules) are made or obtained), no notices to, filings with, or
authorizations, consents or approvals of any Governmental Entity are necessary
for the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents to which such Person is a party, or the consummation by such Person
of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for (i) to the extent
necessary, compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, or (ii) those the

 or similar payment in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of such Person or any
of such Persons Affiliates, for which Sellers or any Group Company may
become liable.

Section 5.5 _Financing_.

 

(a) Attached hereto as _Exhibit T_ are true, complete and correct copies of
(i) the executed Subscription Agreements, dated as of the date hereof,
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the
Investors have agreed to provide equity financing (the " _Equity Financing_ ")
to Dory Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) executed commitment letters and corresponding customarily
redacted fee letters (none of which redacted terms affect the amount or
availability of the Debt Financing or impose any conditions on the receipt of
the Debt Financing) (the " _Debt Financing Commitments,_ " as each may be
amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified,
waived or replaced from time to time to the extent permitted by  _Section_ __
_ 6.12(a)_ and, together with the Subscription Agreements, the " _Financing
Commitments_ ") from the financial institutions or principal investors
identified therein (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") to provide, or cause to
be provided, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in
the amounts set forth therein for the purpose, among other things, of funding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the related fees and
expenses incurred by the Holding Companies in connection therewith and for the
other purposes set forth therein (being collectively referred to as the "
_Debt Financing_ ", and together with the Equity Financing collectively
referred to as the " _Financing_ "). Each of the Financing Commitments is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of HYAC or Dory Parent, as applicable,
and, to the knowledge of HYAC, the other parties thereto. Each of the
Financing Commitments is in full force and effect, and none of the Financing
Commitments has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended
or modified in any respect, and no such amendment or modification is
contemplated (except for amendments, restatements, supplements or other
modifications to add additional agents thereto). HYAC is not in breach of any
of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitments, and
no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to
satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in
_Article 3_ and _Article 4_ in all material respects and the performance by
Sellers of their respective obligations to be performed prior to the Closing
hereunder in all material respects, HYAC (i) has no reason to believe that
any event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would constitute a breach or default under any of the Financing Commitments,
(ii) is not aware of any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of
the representations or warranties of HYAC or Dory Parent in any of the
Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material respect and (iii) has no
reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by
the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be made available
on the Closing Date. Neither any Investor nor any Lender has notified HYAC of
its intention to terminate all or any portion of the Financing Commitments or
not to provide the Financing. The net cash proceeds from the Financing,
together with the proceeds from HYACs trust account, will be sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis,
including the payment of the amounts to be paid to Sellers under _Article 2_ ,
any fees and expenses of or payable by Buyer or the Group Companies, and any
related repayment or refinancing of any Indebtedness of the Group

 Companies, and any other amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any
Ancillary Document. HYAC has paid in full any and all commitment or other
fees required by the Debt Financing Commitments that are due as of the date
hereof, and will pay, after the date hereof, all such fees as they become due.
There are no conditions precedent or contingencies to the obligations of the
parties under the Financing Commitments (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions in the related fee letters or otherwise) to make the full amount of
the Financing available to Buyer on the terms therein except as expressly set
forth in the unredacted portion of the Financing Commitments. There are no
side letters or other agreements, understandings, contracts or arrangements
(written, oral or otherwise) related to the Financing (other than the
Financing Commitments). No Person has any right to impose, and no Investor,
Lender, or Buyer has any obligation to accept, any condition precedent,
contingency or requirement to such funding other than any of the conditions
expressly set forth in the unredacted portions of the Financing Commitments
nor any reduction to the aggregate amount available under the Financing
Commitments on the Closing Date (nor any term or condition which would have
the effect of reducing the aggregate amount available under the Financing
Commitments on the Closing Date). Subject to the satisfaction (or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver) of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 7.1_ , _7.2_ and _7.3_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of such conditions), HYAC has no reason to believe that the
satisfaction on a timely basis of the conditions to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing will not occur, or that the Financing will not
be available on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a
condition to the Closing under this Agreement for Buyer to obtain the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing.

Section 5.6 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, assuming (i) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties contained in _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ in all
material respects and (ii) the performance by Sellers, of their
respective obligations to be performed prior to the Closing hereunder in all
material respects, Buyer and the Group Companies (taken as a whole) will not
(a) be insolvent (either because their combined financial condition is such
that the sum of their combined debts is greater than the fair value of their
combined assets or because the fair salable value of their combined assets is
less than the amount required to pay their combined probable liability on
their combined existing debts as they mature), (b) have unreasonably small
capital with which to engage in their business, or (c) have incurred debts
beyond their ability to pay as they become due.

 

Section 5.7 _Investment_. Buyer is an "accredited investor" within the meaning
of Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
" _Securities Act_ "), and is able to bear any economic risks associated with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer is acquiring the
Acquired Equity Securities and the Holding Company Equity Securities set

Agreement solely for investment for its own account, and not with a view to,

applicable state and Federal Securities Laws. Buyer has sufficient knowledge

evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the Acquired Equity
Securities and the Holding Company Equity Securities set forth on _Section_ __
_ 1.1(a) of the Seller Schedules_ and is capable of bearing the economic
risks of such investment, including a complete loss of its investment in such

extent applicable.

shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or

Agreement, (i) in the case of any Consents from any third party that may be
required in connection with the foregoing, Sellers, the Holding Companies and

of the __Seller Schedules_ which it does not seek or obtain in connection with
the transactions prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
consents of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All costs incurred in connection with
obtaining such consents, including, if applicable, the HSR Act filing fee,
shall be borne by HYAC; _provided_ , _however_ , that each Party shall bear
its out-of-pocket costs and expenses of its own legal counsel and other
advisors or consultants in connection with the preparation of any such filings
or consents. Each Party shall make, or cause to be made, to the extent
necessary, an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement promptly (and in any event, the
filing under the HSR Act within ten Business Days) after the date of this
Agreement (unless filed prior to the date of this Agreement) and shall respond
as promptly as practicable to any requests by the appropriate Governmental
Entities for additional information and documentary material pursuant to the
HSR Act, if applicable. Each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of

faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed written
communication to any Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties agrees not to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by
telephone with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with, in the case of HYAC or
Dory US Holding Company, the Seller Representative, or, in the case of any
Seller, Dory Parent, Dory US Merger Sub or Dory Foreign Holding Company, HYAC
in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity,
gives, in the case of HYAC or Dory US Holding Company, the Seller
Representative, or, in the case of any Seller, Dory Parent, Dory US Merger

(c) Except as required by this Agreement, HYAC shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, engage in any action or enter into any transaction or
permit any action to be taken or transaction to be entered into, in each case,
that would prevent or materially delay obtaining the consents of all
Governmental Entities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, HYAC shall
not, and shall cause its Affiliates and their respective ultimate parent
entities and Subsidiaries not to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging with
or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a portion of the assets of or
equity in, or by any other manner, any business or any corporation,
partnership, association or other business organization or division thereof,
or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets or equity interests, if
the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation
of such acquisition, merger or consolidation would reasonably be expected to:
(i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or increase the risk of not
obtaining, any consents, authorizations, orders, declarations or approvals of
any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including, if applicable, pursuant to the HSR Act) or the
expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period; (ii) increase the
risk of any Governmental Entity seeking or entering an order prohibiting the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii)
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise; or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, upon
reasonable notice, Sellers shall provide to HYAC and its Representatives
during normal business hours reasonable access to the books and records of the
Holding Companies, Group Companies or Business (in a manner so as to not
interfere with the normal business operations of any Group Company or any of
its Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall not extend to
any sampling or analysis of soil, groundwater, building materials or other
environmental media of the sort generally referred to as a Phase II
environmental investigation. All of such information shall be treated as
"Confidential Information" pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement, the provisions of which are by this reference hereby incorporated
herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
during the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
neither Sellers

 nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to disclose to HYAC or any of
its Representatives any information (i) if and to the extent doing so (A)
would violate any contract or Law to which any Seller or any of its
Affiliates is a party, bound or is subject or (B) could, as reasonably
determined upon the advice of counsel, result in the loss of the ability to
successfully assert attorney-client and work product privileges (provided,
that, in case of each of (A) and (B), Sellers shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to provide such access as can be provided (or
otherwise convey such information regarding the applicable matter as can be
conveyed) or in a manner without violating such privilege, contract or Law),
(ii) if a Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and HYAC or any of
its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and
such information is reasonably pertinent thereto or (iii) information
relating to Taxes or Tax Returns other than information to the extent relating
to the Holding Companies, Group Companies or the Business; _provided_ that the
Sellers and/or their Affiliates shall provide notice of the withholding of
access or information on any such basis.

(b) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date (such
period of time, the " _Confidentiality Period_ "), each Seller shall (and
shall cause its Affiliates to and its and their respective Representatives who
has received Business Confidential Information to) (i) treat and hold as
confidential all confidential or proprietary information of the Holding
Companies or Group Companies and either in existence on or prior to the
Closing or delivered to a Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document after the Closing (the " _Business Confidential Information_ ") and
(ii) refrain from using any of the Business Confidential Information except in
connection with its obligations or rights under this Agreement, any Ancillary
Document or any other contract between any Seller or any of its Affiliates, on
the one hand, and HYAC or any of its Affiliates (including any Holding Company
or Group Company), on the other hand, or in connection with any dispute or
Proceeding arising in connection with any of the foregoing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that none of the foregoing shall be deemed to be Business
Confidential Information (A) information that is generally available to or
known by the public (other than through disclosure by any Seller, any of their
Affiliates or their respective Representatives in violation of this _Section_
__ _ 6.3(b)_), (B) information that is lawfully acquired by any Seller, any
of their Affiliates or their respective Representatives after the Closing from
a source which, to the actual knowledge of Sellers, is not prohibited from
disclosing such information by a legal, contractual, fiduciary or similar
obligation, or (C) information that is independently derived or acquired by
any Seller, any of their Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
after the Closing without reference to or use of information subject to the
confidentiality obligations of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_, in the event that
any Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
is required or requested to disclose any Business Confidential Information
during the Confidentiality Period by Law or to a Governmental Entity or
otherwise in connection with compliance, Tax or regulatory activity, then any
of the foregoing Persons shall notify HYAC promptly of such request or
requirement so that HYAC may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_. If, in the
absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, such
Person, on the advice of its outside legal counsel, is compelled to disclose
any Business Confidentiality Information, such Person may disclose only that
portion of such Business Confidential Information to which it is advised by
its counsel that it is legally required to disclose. For the avoidance of
doubt, the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(b)_ are in
addition to any continuing obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements.

(c) During the Confidentiality Period, HYAC and each Holding Company shall
(and shall cause the Group Companies, each of their respective Affiliates and
all of their respective Representatives who have received Seller Confidential
Information to) (i) treat and hold as confidential all confidential or
proprietary information related to any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates delivered to HYAC, any of the Holding Companies or Group Companies,
any of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
(other than Business Confidential Information) (the " _Seller Confidential
Information_ ") and (ii) refrain from using any of the Seller Confidential
Information except in connection with its obligations or rights under this
Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any other contract between any Seller or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and HYAC, any Holding Company or any
of their Affiliates (including any Group Company), on the other hand, or in
connection with any dispute or Proceeding arising in connection with any of
the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the foregoing shall be
deemed to be Seller Confidential Information: (A) information that is
generally available to or known by the public (other than through disclosure
by HYAC, Dory Parent, any of the Group Companies, any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives in violation of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_); (B) information that is lawfully acquired by HYAC,
Dory Parent, any of the Group Companies, any of their respective Affiliates
or their respective representatives after the Closing from a source which, to
the actual knowledge of HYAC and Dory Parent is not prohibited from disclosing
such information by a legal, contractual, fiduciary or similar obligation, or
(C) information that is independently derived or acquired by HYAC, Dory
Parent, any Group Company, any of their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives after the Closing without reference to or use of
information subject to the confidentiality obligations of this _Section_ __ _
6.3(c)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _
6.3(c)_, in the event that HYAC, Dory Parent, any of the Group Companies, any
of their respective Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives is
required or requested to disclose any Seller Confidential Information during
the Confidentiality Period by Law or to a Governmental Entity or otherwise in
connection with compliance, Tax or regulatory activity, then any of the
foregoing Persons shall notify the Seller Representative promptly of such
request or requirement so that the Seller Representative may seek an
appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, such Person, on the advice of its outside
legal counsel, is compelled to disclose any Seller Confidentiality
Information, such Person may disclose only that portion of such Seller
Confidential information to which it is advised by its counsel that it is
legally required to disclose. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_ are in addition to any continuing
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 6.4 _Public Announcements._

 

(a) None of the Parties nor any of their respective Representatives shall
issue any press releases or make any public announcements with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative and HYAC; _provided_ , _however_
, that each Party may make any such announcement which it in good
faith believes, based on advice of counsel, is necessary or advisable in
connection with any requirement of Law, it being understood and agreed that
each Party shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, confer with the other
Parties concerning the timing and content of such press release or public
announcement before the same is made.

filing, notice or application.

Section 6.5 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) As of the Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause each individual then
employed by the Sellers or their Affiliates (other than a Group Company) that
is listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ _of the Seller Schedules_ to be employed
by the Group Companies, Buyer or one of Buyers Affiliates (the " _Transferred
Employees_ "); for all purposes of  _Article 3_ and _Article 4_ , the
Transferred Employees shall be deemed to be employees of a Group Company.
Following the Closing Date through December 31, 2019, Buyer shall provide, or
cause to be provided, each employee of the Group Companies, including those
employees listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ _of the Seller Schedules_ (the "
_Employees_ ") who continues to be employed by a Group Company or Buyer or any
of its Affiliates with (i) base salary or base hourly wage rate and annual
cash bonus opportunity that is no less than the salary, wage rate or annual
bonus opportunity as provided to such Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and (ii) other employee benefits (excluding equity
arrangements, retention or change in control arrangements, discounts and
access to "Bliss" and other non-Group Company spas, and the "Business Unit
Exit Incentive" and "Business Unit Incentive Bonus" arrangements) that are
comparable in the aggregate to those provided under the Employee Benefit Plans
as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each Employee
represented by a labor union or other labor organization, Buyer shall
provide, or cause to be provided, such terms and conditions of employment as
required by the terms of any collective bargaining agreement or other
agreement with any such labor union or other labor organization.

(b) Buyer further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
and shall cause its Affiliates and each Group Company to grant all of its
employees credit for any service with a Group Company or any of its Affiliates
earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility and vesting purposes for
any 401(k), vacation and paid time off, or health and welfare

 benefit plan, as applicable, and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance benefit determinations under any such benefit or compensation plan,
policy, program, contract, agreement or arrangement that may be established
or maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any Group Company on or
after the Closing Date (the " _New Plans_ "), unless this would result in a
duplication of benefits. In addition, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts
to (A) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-
at-work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and
evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived
or satisfied by an employee under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing
Date and (B) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket
expenses paid on or before the Closing Date by any Employee (or covered
dependent thereof) to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation. Buyer agrees that Buyer and the Group Companies shall be solely
responsible for satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the Code for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries"
as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 54.4980B-9.

 

(c) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall permit each Employee who was a
participant in or eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan prior to
the Closing to immediately following the Closing be eligible to participate
in a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan established or
designated by Buyer (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "). From the date hereof until
the earlier of one Business Day prior to the Closing, the parties hereto agree
to reasonably cooperate in good faith and to reasonably determine whether
Sellers, Buyer and their respective Subsidiaries may effect a transfer of the
assets related to the Employees from any or all Employee Benefit Plans
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code from such Employee
Benefit Plans to the Buyer 401(k) Plan, with each such transfer to occur
in accordance with the requirements of Section 414(l) of the Code and not
resulting in any Liabilities to the Group Companies. If the parties determine
that a transfer of assets related to the Employees from any or all Employee
Benefit Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code from
such Employee Benefit Plans to the Buyer 401(k) Plan may be made in accordance
with the immediately precedent sentence, then as promptly as practicable after
the Closing Date, Sellers or one of its Subsidiaries and Buyer or one of its
Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) shall cause such transfer of
assets with respect to any such Employee Benefit Plans to occur (it being
understood that in the event that Buyer reasonably determines that there is a
risk that a Seller 401(k) plan may have a qualification failure, then Buyer
may elect by giving written notice to the Seller Representative to not accept
an asset transfer from such Seller 401(k) plan). If the transfers
contemplated by the immediately prior sentence do not occur with respect to
one or more such Employee Benefit Plans, then as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall take any and all actions as may be required to permit each such Employee
to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within
the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, and including plan loans) to
the Buyer 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to such Employee from such 401(k)
plan (including plan loans).

(d) The Group Companies shall be solely responsible for and shall discharge
as soon as practicable following the Closing the Liabilities set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)(i)_ _of the Seller Schedules_. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers shall have no Liability
relating to, arising out of, or otherwise resulting from the transfer or
employment of, or

 



100

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 otherwise relating to, any of the Transferred Employees, including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than
(x) the Liabilities set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)(ii) of the Seller
Schedules_ and (y) Liabilities with respect to any breach of a representation
or warranty contained in _Article 3_ or _Article 4_ pursuant to, and subject
to the terms and conditions of (including the limitations contained in),
_Article 9_ or based upon Actual Fraud.

(e) Effective no later than the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause (i) the
Group Companies, to the extent applicable, to cease to be a participating
employer in any Employee Benefit Plan (other than a Group Company Plan) and
(ii) each Employee to cease to participate in, be covered by, and/or accrue
benefits under any Employee Benefit Plan (except with respect to a Group
Company Plan and to the extent of obligations that remain a Liability of a
Group Company pursuant to this Agreement).

 

(f) For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not, and shall cause the Group Companies not to, implement
any layoffs of Group Company employees that could trigger any obligations
under WARN.

(g) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the foregoing provisions in
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ with respect to Employees or any former employees of
the Group Companies are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties hereto and shall not (i) create any right (A) in any other person,
including without limitation, any employees, former employees, any participant
or any beneficiary thereof in any Employee Benefit Plan, Foreign Benefit Plan
or New Plan, or (B) to continued employment with Buyer or any Group Company
or their Affiliates for any duration or (ii) constitute an amendment to or any
other modification of or adoption of any New Plan, Employee Benefit Plan or
Foreign Benefit Plan or, subject to compliance with the other provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, interfere with Buyers or any Group Companys right
to amend, modify or terminate any New Plan, Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign
Benefit Plan or to terminate the employment of any employee of any Group
Company for any reason.

(h) The Sellers shall (i) prior to the Closing Date, solicit from each
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code)
who could otherwise receive any payment or benefits that would constitute a
"parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code)
a waiver of such disqualified individuals rights to some or all of such
payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that all remaining
payments and/or benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute
payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (ii) prior to
the Closing Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver
described in clause (i), submit to a stockholder vote (along with adequate
disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the
Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any such
"disqualified individual" to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to
soliciting such waivers and approval materials, the Sellers shall provide
drafts of such waivers and approval materials to Buyer for its review and
comment no later than two Business Days prior to soliciting such waivers
and soliciting such approval, and the Sellers shall consider any comments
provided by Buyer in good faith. At least five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide to the Sellers and their advisors a summary of the
compensatory arrangements that Buyer or its Affiliates are providing or
entering into with respect to any disqualified individual in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that could be treated as a
parachute payment (either alone or together with any other payments to a

 



101

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 disqualified individual), _provided_ , that, in any event, the Sellers
failure to include such compensatory arrangements in the stockholder voting
materials described herein as a result of Buyers failure to provide such
arrangements, will not result in a breach of the covenants set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(h)_. If any of the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be
approved in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the
Code as contemplated above, such Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or
provided. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to Buyer evidence
reasonably acceptable to Buyer that a vote of the stockholders was solicited
in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section and that either
(i) the requisite number of votes of the stockholders was obtained with
respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (ii) the
280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G
Benefits shall not be made or provided.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing, (i) Sellers
shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, transfer to Buyer, the Group
Companies or one of their Subsidiaries, an amount in cash equal to the excess,
if any, of the aggregate contributions to Sellers flexible spending account
plan maintained in the United States intended to be covered under Section 125
of the Code with respect to the Employees and their dependents (the " _Seller
Flexible Spending Account Plan_ ") made by the Employees prior to the Closing
Date over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to the Employees prior to
the Closing Date, and (ii) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Group Companies or
one of their Subsidiaries to, cause such amounts to be credited to each such
Employees flexible spending accounts plan maintained in the United States by
the Buyer, the Group Companies or one of their Subsidiaries intended to be
covered under Section 125 of the Code (the " _Buyer Flexible Spending Account
Plan_ "). In connection with such transfer, Buyer shall deem that such
employees deferral elections made under the Seller Flexible Spending Account
Plan for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs shall continue in
effect under the Buyer Flexible Spending Account Plan for the remainder of
the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs. If the aggregate
reimbursement payouts made to the Employees from the Seller Flexible Spending
Account Plan prior to the Closing Date exceed the aggregate accumulated
contributions made by the Employees to such plan prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall make a payment equal to the value of such excess to Sellers as
soon as practicable following Buyers or the Group Companies receipt of
additional contributions from the Employee.

 

(j) On and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with
Buyer and the Group Companies to as promptly as practicable provide such
information and assistance reasonably requested by the Group Companies so that
Buyer and the Group Companies may implement the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 6.5_ and address and mitigate any potential Liabilities that may arise
as a result of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ or otherwise with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such cooperation
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(j)_ (other than the provision of
information as required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(j)_) shall require any
Seller to incur any Liabilities that it would not incur but for any such
cooperation or make, or cause to be made, any payments to any third party.

Section 6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that (i) all rights to indemnification or exculpation now
existing in favor of the directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries,
trustees and agents of each Group Company, as provided in a Group Companys
Governing Documents or otherwise in effect

 



102

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any matters occurring on or
prior to the Closing, shall survive the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect, and (ii) the Group
Companies will perform and discharge all obligations to provide such indemnity
and exculpation. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, the Group
Companies shall advance expenses in connection with such indemnification as
provided in such Group Companys Governing Documents or other applicable
agreements. The indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation
provisions of the Group Companies Governing Documents shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, as of the Closing
or at any time prior to the Closing, were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries, trustees or agents of any Group Company (the " _D andO Persons_")
to be so indemnified, have their liability limited or be exculpated with
respect to any matters occurring on or prior to Closing Date and relating to
the fact that such DandO Person was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary,
trustee or agent of any Group Company, unless such modification is required by
applicable Law.

 

(b) Neither Buyer, nor any Group Company shall settle, compromise or consent
to the entry of any Order in any actual or threatened Proceeding in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by a DandO Person under
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise or Order
includes an unconditional release of such DandO Person from all liability
arising out of such Proceeding. Neither Buyer nor any Group Company shall have
any obligation under this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ to any Person when and if a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine (and
such determination shall have become final and non-appealable) that the
indemnification of such Person in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited
by applicable Law.

 

(c) Sellers shall cause the Group Companies to purchase, prior to the Closing,
and Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to maintain in effect for a period
of six years following the Closing Date, without lapses in coverage, a "tail"
policy providing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the
benefit of the those Persons who are currently covered by any comparable
insurance policies of the Group Companies as of the date hereof with respect
to matters occurring on or prior to the Closing. The cost of such "tail"
policy shall be borne equally by HYAC, on one hand, and the Sellers, on the
other hand. Such "tail" policy shall provide coverage on terms (with respect
to coverage and amount) that are substantially the same as (and no less
favorable in the aggregate to the insured than) the coverage provided under
the Group Companies directors and officers liability insurance policies as
of the date hereof; _provided_ , that neither the Group Companies nor Buyer
shall be required to pay a premium for such "tail" policy in excess of
300% of the most recent annual premium paid by Sellers or the Group Companies
prior to the date of this Agreement and, in such event, the Group Companies
(or Buyer on their behalf) shall purchase the maximum coverage available for
300% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Group Companies prior to
the date of this Agreement.

(d) If Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall merge or consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the surviving or continuing corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of their respective properties and assets as an entity in
one (1) or a series of related transactions to any Person, then in each such
case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors or assigns of
Buyer or such Group Company shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_.

(e) The DandO Persons entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ are intended
to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_. This _Section_
__ _ 6.6_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Buyer and
the Group Companies.

 Section 6.7 _Documents and Information_. After the Closing Date, Buyer and
the Group Companies shall, until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date,
retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of
the Group Companies in existence on the Closing Date and make the same
available, upon reasonable advance notice, for inspection and copying by
Sellers (at Sellers expense) during normal business hours of the Group
Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business
operations of any Group Company). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of the Group Companies shall be
required to disclose to Sellers any information (i) if and to the extent
doing so (A) would violate any contract or Law to which Buyer, any Group
Company or any of their respective Affiliates is a party or is subject or (B)
could, as reasonably determined upon the advice of counsel, result in the
loss of the ability to successfully assert attorney-client and work product
privileges (and in such event, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts (at
the sole cost and expense of the Sellers) to provide such access as can be
provided (or otherwise convey such information regarding the applicable matter
as can be conveyed) or in a manner without violating such privilege, contract
or Law), or (ii) if Buyer, any Group Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Sellers or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such
information is reasonably pertinent thereto.

 

Section 6.8 _Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations_.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
HYAC hereby agrees that it is not authorized to and shall not (and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
Representatives to) contact any employee (excluding executive officers),
customer, supplier, distributor or other material business relation of any
Group Company regarding any Group Company, the Business or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents without the prior
written consent of the Seller Representative.

 

Section 6.9 _Release of Guaranties_. Sellers and Buyer shall (i) prior to the
Closing and, in the event that the actions provided for in this clause (i)
are not completed at or prior to the Closing, at and after the Closing,
reasonably cooperate and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to, effective as of the Closing and, in the event that the actions provided
for in this clause (i) are not completed at or prior to the Closing, effective
promptly following the Closing, terminate or cause to be terminated, or cause
Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for Sellers
and their respective Affiliates or former Affiliates (other than the Group
Companies) (collectively, the " _Seller Guarantors_ ") in respect of all
obligations of the Seller Guarantors under, any guarantee of or relating to
obligations or liabilities (including under any contract, letter of credit or
Leased Real Property) of the Business and/or the Group Companies listed on
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_ _(a) of the Seller Schedules_ (collectively, the " _Pre-
Closing Guaranties_"), and

 



104

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 (ii) at and after the Closing, reasonably cooperate and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to, effective promptly following the
Closing, terminate or cause to be terminated, or cause Buyer or one of its
Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the Seller Guarantors in
respect of all obligations of the Seller Guarantors under, any guarantee of or
relating to obligations or liabilities (including under any contract, letter
of credit or Leased Real Property) of the Business and/or the Group Companies
listed on _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b) of the Seller Schedules_ (collectively "
_Post-Closing_ _Guaranties_ " and, together with the Pre-Closing Guaranties,
collectively, the " _Guaranties_ "). Buyer shall, from and after the Closing,
indemnify and hold harmless, on a joint and several basis, the Seller
Guarantors from and against all Losses incurred by any such Person from and
against any continuing obligations and liabilities under any such Guaranties.
Buyer shall (a) keep the Sellers reasonably apprised of the status of any
communication or correspondence (written or otherwise) with any third parties
related to the Guaranties or Buyers obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.9_ and upon request of the Sellers provide any information or documentation
related to the Guaranties or Buyers efforts pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.9_ that is reasonably requested (including any draft or final documents in
order to implement this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_), (b) reasonably consult with
Sellers and its Representatives in connection with its obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_, and (c) provide Sellers and its Representatives with the
opportunity to review and comment on any documents or agreements with
third parties with respect to the implementation of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_
and consider in good faith any comments provided by or on behalf of Sellers
with respect thereto. To the extent that any Seller Guarantor has
performance obligations under any such Guaranty, Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to (x) perform, or cause its Affiliates to perform, such
obligations on behalf of such Seller Guarantor or (y) otherwise take such
action as reasonably requested by Sellers so as to put such Seller Guarantor
in the same position as if Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and not such Seller
Guarantor, had performed or were performing such obligations. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document, in no event shall Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, any Holding Company) or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Group Company or
Holding Company) be required to pay any amounts or offer or grant any
accommodations to any third party in connection with the termination or
substitution of any Seller Guarantors obligations under any of the Guaranties
(and, for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Buyers or any Sellers
"reasonable best efforts" be deemed to require or be construed as a
requirement of any Seller or any of its Affiliates (including, prior to the
Closing, any Group Company or Holding Company) or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, any Group Company or Holding
Company) to make, or cause to be made, any such payment or be required to make
any such concession); _provided_ that the Buyer and any Seller shall agree to
the modification of any of the Guaranties that solely results in Dory Parent
(and will not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay agreement to the
modification of any of the Guaranties that solely results in a direct
or indirect wholly-owned Affiliate of Dory Parent) being substituted in all
respects for the Seller Guarantors in respect of all obligations of such
Seller Guarantors under such Guaranties.

Group Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period that are shown as due on and
required to be paid in connection with any Buyer Tax Return filed in

having been, at any time prior to the Closing Date, a member of an
affiliated, consolidated or combined group for Income Tax purposes that
included such Person, or (y) as a result of such Group Company having become a
transferee or successor to such Person prior to the Closing, or (z) pursuant
to any contract entered into by such Group Company or Holding Company prior to
the Closing (other than any contract the principal purpose of which does not
relate to Taxes) (the Income Taxes described in this clause (B), " _Excluded
Taxes_ "); (C) any Taxes required to be paid by a Group Company as a result of
the conduct or conclusion of the Italian Tax Matter; (D) fifty percent of any
Transfer Taxes; or (E) any breach by a Seller of any covenant or agreement

__ _ 6.10(c)_.

(iii) In the case of any Straddle Period:

(A) real, personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_
") allocated to the portion of such period that is a Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the Straddle Period through the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period; and

 

(B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) allocated to the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date shall be computed as if such taxable period ended
as of the end of the day on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes
attributable to the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership, other
"flowthrough" entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 957(a) of the Code or any similar provision of Law), as if the
taxable period of such partnership, other "flowthrough" entity or controlled
foreign corporation ended as of the end of the day on the Closing Date
(whether or not such Taxes arise in a Straddle Period of the applicable
owner).

its Subsidiaries to not) knowingly with respect to OSW, Steiner Spa Asia,
Steiner Spa Bahamas, and Steiner Marks (the " _Contributed Group Companies_

Cash Equivalents, marketable securities (any security for which there is a
market on an established securities market or otherwise) and/or obligations
(an obligation being a fixed or contingent obligation to make a payment or

Closing Date, the Passive Assets of the Contributed Group Companies and
their Subsidiaries comprise greater than 50 percent of the gross value of all

(xi) Following the Closing Date, Steiner Leisure shall not knowingly transfer
any of its Dory Parent Common Shares to any Person that would constitute a
United States shareholder (or that to the knowledge of Steiner Leisure after
reasonable inquiry is more than fifty percent (50%) owned by any Person that
would constitute a United States shareholder) (in each case within the
meaning of Section 951(b) of the Code and taking into account the effect of
Notice 2018-13 or any amended or successor Notice or other guidance issued by
the IRS or the Department of the Treasury) if such transfer would result in
such Person owning nine and nine-tenths percent (9.9%) or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or nine and
nine-tenth percent (9.9%) or more of the total value of shares of all classes
of stock of Dory Parent, in each case, unless Steiner Leisure first provides
written notice (a " _Transfer Notice_ ") to Dory Parent of Steiner Leisures
intent to consummate such transfer at least seventy-two (72) hours prior to
such proposed transfer. If (x) the Board of Directors of Dory Parent
reasonably and in good faith determines (i) that (A) after giving effect to
such proposed transfer such proposed transfer would reasonably be expected to
result in the aggregate ownership for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section
1.863-8 (determined in accordance with Section 958 of the Code and taking
into account the effect of Notice 2018-13 or any amended or successor Notice
or other guidance issued by the IRS or the Department of the Treasury) by one
or more United States shareholders (within the meaning of Section 951(b) of
the Code and taking into account the effect of Notice 2018-13 or any amended
or successor Notice or other guidance issued by the IRS or the Department of
the Treasury) of one or more of the non-U.S. Subsidiaries of OSW that are
treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes exceeding twenty-
five percent (25%) or (B) the aggregate ownership for purposes of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.863-8 (determined in accordance with Section 958 of the
Code and taking into account the effect of Notice 2018-13 or any amended or
successor Notice or other guidance issued by the IRS or the Department of the

Section 951(b) of the Code and taking into account the effect of
Notice 2018-13 or any amended or successor Notice or other guidance issued by
the IRS or the Department of the Treasury) of one or more of the non-U.S.
Subsidiaries of OSW that are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income
tax purposes exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) as of the time of such transfer
and (ii) such proposed transfer would reasonably be expected to increase the
aggregate ownership described in the foregoing clause (i) and (y) Dory Parent
provides to Steiner Leisure written notice of such determination, together
with information reasonably supporting such determination, prior to the end of
such 72 hour period, then Steiner Leisure shall not consummate such proposed
transfer. If the Board of Directors of Dory Parent does not make such a
determination or Dory Parent does not so deliver such written notice, then
Steiner Leisure may, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or the Governing Documents of Dory Parent, consummate such
proposed transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary
in the Governing Documents of Dory Parent, (1) Steiner Leisure shall not be
prohibited from transferring Dory Parent Common Shares if (w) the transfer is
otherwise approved by the Board of Directors of Dory Parent, (x) the transfer
is to an underwriter or similar financial institution not purchasing such Dory
Parent Common Shares for investment purposes, (y) such transfer is through a
brokered transaction on a securities exchange in which the identity of the
transferee is not known to Steiner Leisure or (z) such transfer is to a
Secondary Investor and involves the transfer of no more Dory Parent Common
Shares than are contemplated by any (i) Secondary Purchase Agreement in effect
on the date hereof or (ii) Secondary Purchase Agreement entered into after the
date hereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and (2) in
the event that Steiner Leisure does not consummate the transfer described in a
Transfer Notice within 30 days following Dory Parents receipt of such

requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(b)(xi)_ with respect thereto.

(the " _Seller Group Tax Returns_ "). Buyer shall prepare and provide to the
Seller Representative a Tax Package relating to each Seller Group Tax Return
that is unfiled as of the Closing Date and that is required to include any
Group Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Seller Representative shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer to determine the Seller Group Tax Returns for
which a Tax Package is required and the information reasonably necessary to
be provided as part of each Tax Package. Buyer shall provide such Tax Packages
to the Seller Representative as promptly as practicable but in no event later

provide the Seller Representative with a copy in draft form of each Buyer Tax
Return that could result in an indemnification obligation of Sellers pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ at least thirty (30) days prior to the date on
which such Tax Return is due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) (or if such Tax Return is due within thirty (30) days after the
Closing Date, then as soon as reasonably practicable). The Sellers
Representative shall have the right within fifteen (15) days of the date of
receipt of such Tax Return to review, comment on and make changes to each such
tax Return in good faith. Buyer shall consider the Seller Representatives
changes to each such Tax Return in good faith and, to the extent consistent
with the standard described in the second sentence of this  _Section_ __ _
6.10(c)(ii)_. Buyer shall be obligated to reflect each of the positions or
comments requested by Sellers that could have an impact on an indemnification
obligation of sellers pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ unless Buyer has
received (and shared with the Seller Representative) a written opinion from an
nationally recognized tax counsel to the effect that the Sellers position is
not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit. Buyer shall timely file
each Buyer Tax Return in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)(ii)_
and, without prejudice to the rights of any Buyer Indemnitee under this

choice in connection therewith and (C) settle any such Contest on such terms
as it may determine; _provided_ , that the Seller Representative shall keep
Buyer informed of the status as it relates to any of the Group Companies or
Holding Companies and shall not settle any such Contest without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned, if such settlement would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect Buyer. If the Seller Representative elects not to conduct any
such Contest (other than any Contest relating to a Seller Group Tax Return),
then Buyer (x) shall

 diligently prosecute such Contest in good faith, (y) shall, upon reasonably
request, keep the Sellers Representative reasonably informed of the status of

Entity and (ii) give the other Party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the

the Target Companies to deliver the following certificates to Buyer: (i) from
each Seller that is not a "foreign person" for purposes of Section 1445 of the
Code and that is selling Acquired Equity Securities in a Target Company and
the Dory Parent Common Shares set forth on  _Section_ __ _ 1.1 of the Seller
Schedules_ that is a domestic corporation for U.S. federal income tax

other principles set forth on the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule (such
allocation, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(g)_,
the " _Allocation_ "). Such allocation shall be adjusted in accordance with
such principles to reflect any adjustments to the Estimated Purchase Price in
arriving at the Final Purchase Price, and any other adjustments to the
Purchase Price. The Parties shall file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent
with the Allocation, and no Party shall take any position in any Tax forum
that is inconsistent with the Allocation absent a determination (within the

respect of) (i) any payments made by any Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
Group Company to a Governmental Entity in connection with an Italian Tax
Matter prior to the Closing, (ii) any other payments of withholding Taxes paid

the STO Italy Tax Amount pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.10(h))_, Buyer
shall, or shall cause the relevant Group Company to, pay over to the Seller
Representative (for further distribution to the Sellers) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an amount equal to such amount. Upon the
occurrence of an STO Italy Final Determination, the Seller Representative
shall give prompt written notice thereof (including a true and complete copy
of any documentation with respect to such STO Italy Final Determination) to
the Buyer. Within ten (10) days after the receipt by the
Seller Representative of such STO Italy Final Determination, in the event
that such STO Italy Final Determination is not an STO Italy Favorable
Determination, the Sellers shall (on a joint and several basis) pay to Dory
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds an amount equal to the
STO Italy Tax Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) initiate any Italian
Tax Matter (or, unless otherwise consented to by the Seller Representative
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), any
derivative or related Proceeding thereto that would reasonably be expected to

satisfactory to Buyer (acting reasonably) and in an amount equal to the STO
Italy Tax Amount _plus_ any amounts asserted by any Italian Tax Authority in
respect of the Italian Tax Matter. Steiner Leisure shall (x)
immediately notify the Buyer if it falls below the Asset Threshold (it being
understood that such notice shall not limit Steiner Leisures obligations

to Buyer or the Group Companies, Buyer shall be responsible for obtaining and
maintaining replacement coverage for the Group Companies and the Business and

or circumstances arising, directly or indirectly, out of the operation
or conduct of the Business that occurred prior to the Closing that are
covered by or insured under any occurrence, injury, or offence-based Corporate
Policies of any Seller or any of its Affiliates, Group Companies and Buyer may
make or continue to pursue claims under any such Corporate Policies to the
extent that such policies are available, and any Seller shall, at the sole
cost and expense of Buyer, take any actions reasonably requested by Buyer and

indirectly, out of the operation or conduct of the Business;  _provided_ ,
that Buyer or such applicable Group Company shall exclusively bear (and
Sellers and their Affiliates shall not have any obligation to repay or
reimburse Buyer or any member of the Group Companies therefor) the amount of
any deductibles, retentions or self-insurance associated with claims under
such policies, whether such claims are made by Buyer or any Group Company,
their respective employees or third parties, and shall be liable for all
uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or uncollectible amounts of such claims.

(b) Other than the express rights of Buyer and the Group Companies pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, Sellers and their Affiliates shall retain the
exclusive right to control all claims made under their Corporate Policies and
the benefits and amounts payable thereunder, including the right to reduce
or exhaust the limits of available coverage due to such claims,
notwithstanding whether any such policies or programs apply to any claims any
Group Company has made or could make in the future, and none of Sellers or
their Affiliates shall be obligated to indemnify the Group Companies for such
exhaustion of the limits of liability under the Corporate Policies. It is
further understood and agreed that Sellers and their Affiliates may cancel or
not renew any of the Corporate Policies at any time, without any liability or
obligation to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies),

injury, or offense-based coverage.

(c) Other than as expressly set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, Buyer

of rights letter)). HYAC shall give the Seller Representative prompt (and in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) written notice (A) upon having
knowledge of any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by any party of any of the Financing Documents
or any termination of any of the Financing Documents, (B) of the receipt of
any notice or other communication from any Person with respect to any material
dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Financing

(D) if for any reason HYAC has determined in good faith that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event, within three (3) Business
Days following delivery by the Seller Representative to HYAC of written
request therefor, HYAC shall provide any information reasonably requested by
the Seller Representative relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(A), (B), (C) or (D) of the immediately preceding sentence. Other than as set

not, without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative, amend,
modify, supplement or waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding
contained in the Financing Documents or any other provision of, or remedies
under, the Financing Documents, in each case to the extent such amendment,
modification, supplement or waiver would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of (1) adversely affecting in any respect the ability of Dory Parent or
HYAC to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by reducing the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing contemplated
in the Debt Financing Commitments (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount) or the aggregate amount of the Equity
Financing contemplated in the Subscription Agreements, (2)
amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions or contingencies
to the Financing in a manner adverse to Sellers or the Group Companies, (3)
delaying the Closing or make the timely funding of the Financing or

rights against the other parties to the Financing Commitments without
otherwise limiting any other rights, remedies or obligations hereunder or
under any Ancillary Document provided, that, subject to the foregoing
limitations, Dory Parent and HYAC may amend, supplement, replace, substitute

similar entities that have not executed such Debt Financing Commitments as of
the date hereof, together with any conforming or ministerial changes related
thereto, but only if the addition of such parties, individually or in the
aggregate, would not violate the restrictions set forth in this sentence). For
purposes of this Agreement, except as expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, references to the " _Debt Financing Commitments_ " shall include
such document as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_ to be amended,
replaced, substituted, modified or waived, in each case from and after such
amendment, replacement, substitution, modification or waiver. HYAC shall
provide to the Group Companies copies of any commitment letter associated with
a replacement Debt Financing Commitment as well as any amendment, waiver,
supplement or modification of any debt commitment letter. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.12(a)_ or this Agreement to the contrary,
(x) in no event shall the Dory Parent Common Shares issued at the Closing
pursuant to the Subscription Agreements be issued at any price per share other
than $10.00 per share (without taking into account, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Dory Parent Warrants issued to any Investor that are
expressly contemplated by, and in the amounts set forth in, such Subscription
Agreement, which Dory Parent Warrants shall, for the avoidance of doubt, be
subject to the Warrant Agreement) and (y) neither HYAC nor any of its
Affiliates shall enter into any contract or arrangement with any Investor

an amount of Debt Financing under the Debt Financing Commitment in an amount
equal to the HYAC Shareholder Redemption Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in no event shall such amounts funded under the Debt Financing Commitment be
required to exceed $50,000,000.

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the

shall promptly use its reasonable best efforts to, (i) arrange to promptly
obtain the Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from
alternative sources, which may include one (1) or more of a senior secured
debt financing and, if necessary, a second lien debt financing, an offering
and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and sale of other debt
securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, when added
to any portion of the Financing that is available, to pay in cash all amounts
required to be paid by HYAC in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") and (ii) obtain a new
financing commitment letter (the " _Alternative Debt Commitment Letter_ ") and
a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that provides for financing
(A) on terms not materially less favorable (including with respect to
conditionality to the availability and funding of any Debt Financing
Commitment), in the aggregate, to Buyer, (B) containing conditions to draw and
other terms that would reasonably be expected to affect the availability
thereof that (1) are not more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions
and terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitments as of the date hereof,
(2) would not reasonably be expected to delay, impede or prevent the Closing
and (3) do not adversely affect the ability of Buyer to enforce its rights
against other parties to the Alternative Debt Commitment Letter (including all
definitive documentation) relative to the ability of Buyer to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitments as in
effect on the date hereof or in the related definitive agreements and (C) in

 Escrow Release Date in accordance with this _Article 9_. Any portion of the
Indemnity Escrow Shares held by the Escrow Agent following the Indemnity
Escrow Release Date with respect to pending but unresolved claims for
indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_ that is not awarded to Buyer upon
the resolution of such claims shall be promptly distributed by the Escrow
Agent to Steiner Leisure. The Buyer and Seller Representative shall, promptly
after final resolution of such pending claims (but in no event later than two
Business Days thereafter), execute a joint instruction to release such amounts
from the Indemnity Escrow Account in accordance with such final resolution
thereof.

Section 9.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) No Buyer Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified for Losses with
respect to the matters described in  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ _(a)_ : (i) with
respect to any claim (or series of related claims) for indemnification if the
amount of Losses with respect to such claim (or series of related claims, as
the case may be) is less than $75,000 (the " _Claim Threshold_ "; any claim
or series of related claims, as the case may be, involving Losses less than
the Claim Threshold being referred to as a " _De Minimis Claim_ ") (it being
understood that (x) subject to clause (ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(a)_
and the other limitations set forth herein, if such Losses exceed the Claim
Threshold, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to seek indemnification for
the full amount of such Losses and (y) any De Minimis Claims shall be
excluded in determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded), and (ii)
until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that would otherwise be
indemnifiable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ _(a)_ exceeds an amount equal
to $3,500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent such Losses
exceed the Deductible. Sellers maximum aggregate Liability for
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ _(a)_ will not exceed
an amount equal to $3,500,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

 

(b) The Claim Threshold, the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to Losses
to the extent relating to or arising from the matters set forth in _Section_
__ _ 6.10_ _,_ _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ _(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(b)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
for any Losses (individually or in the aggregate) related to such matters,
together with any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ _(a)_
or any other indemnifiable Losses with respect to such matters, in excess of
the Final Purchase Price actually received by the Sellers and their
Affiliates.

 

(c) If there is finally determined to be any amount owing to a Buyer
Indemnitee as a result of indemnification pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_
_(a)_ , such amount shall (i) first satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow
Account, and (ii) subject to the last sentence of this _Section_ __ _
9.5(c)_, if such Losses exceed the value of the Indemnity Escrow Shares in
the Indemnity Escrow Account, the sole and exclusive source of recovery of the
Buyer Indemnitees shall be under the RandW Policy (if any). In the case of any
satisfaction from the Indemnity Escrow Account, the Seller Representative
shall promptly (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days thereafter)
execute a joint instruction with Dory Parent to release such amount of
Indemnity Escrow Shares from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Dory Parent to
be held as "treasury" shares or cancelled. If there is determined to be any
amount owing to a Buyer Indemnitee as a result of indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_ _(b)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)(i)_, such amount shall
(i) first be satisfied from the Indemnity Escrow Account, (ii) if recovery is
available under the RandW Policy (if any), from the RandW Policy and (iii)
thereafter, directly from the Sellers, jointly and severally, by wire
transfer to an account

 or accounts designated by Buyer (A) in the case of indemnification pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, within five Business Days following the final
determination of the claim for indemnification giving rise to such payment
obligation or (B) in the case of indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)(i)_, within the time period set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)(iv)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, (i) in the event that HYAC obtains and binds the RandW Policy at
the Closing, to the extent that a Buyer Indemnitee would have (subject to the
terms and conditions hereof) been entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_, but
indemnifiable Losses are recovered by a Buyer Indemnitee from the Indemnity
Escrow Account pursuant to the third sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_
in respect of indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_ and the RandW Policy Retention is not eroded under the
RandW Policy and a Buyer Indemnitee would (but for such RandW Policy Retention not
being eroded under the RandW Policy) be entitled to indemnification under the
RandW Policy, then such Buyer Indemnitee may recover such Losses (and only such
Losses) that would have been recoverable pursuant to the first sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ if the RandW Policy Retention had been eroded, in
an amount not to exceed the Value of the Indemnity Escrow Shares released
from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to the third sentence of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, directly from the Sellers jointly and severally and
(ii) in the event that HYAC does not obtain and bind the RandW Policy at the
Closing, to the extent that a Buyer Indemnitee would have (subject to the
terms and conditions hereof) been entitled to indemnification from the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_,
but indemnifiable Losses are recovered by a Buyer Indemnitee from the
Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to the third sentence of this _Section_ __ _
9.5(c)_ in respect of indemnifiable Losses pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)(i)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.2(b)_, then such Buyer Indemnitee may recover
such Losses (and only such Losses) that would have been recoverable pursuant
to the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ if such amount had not
been released from the Indemnity Escrow Account, in an amount not to exceed
the Value of the Indemnity Escrow Shares released from the Indemnity Escrow
Account pursuant to the third sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_,
directly from the Sellers jointly and severally.

(d) No Seller Indemnitee shall be entitled to be indemnified for Losses with
respect to matters described in _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ _(a)_ : (i) with respect
to any De Minimis Claims (it being understood that (x) subject to clause (ii)
of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.5(d)_ and the other limitations set forth herein,
if such Losses exceed the Claim Threshold, the Seller Indemnitees shall be
entitled to seek indemnification, subject to the Deductible, for the full
amount of such Losses and (y) any De Minimis Claims shall be excluded in
determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded) and (ii) until the
aggregate dollar amount of all Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ _(a)_ exceeds the Deductible, and then only
to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ , that Buyers
maximum aggregate Liability for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 9.3_ _(a)_ will not exceed the Cap.

(e) The amount of any indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this  _Article 9_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ shall be determined net of (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees, as applicable
under insurance policies or other collateral sources (such as contractual
indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with
respect to such Losses (net of the reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket
costs actually incurred in connection with recovering such amount, including,
in the case of any insurance policy, any premiums paid as a result
of recovering such amount) and (ii) the Tax Benefit (as defined below)
actually realized or received by the Indemnified Party receiving such

 



138

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 indemnification payment as a result of Losses (net of any reasonable,
documented and out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with recovery of
such Tax Benefit). The Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to pursue recovery under any insurance policies or other collateral sources
with respect to such Losses (including, for the avoidance of doubt, from and
after the time that the Indemnifying Party makes any payment of any
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this _Article 9_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_)
( _provided_ that "reasonable best efforts" pursuant to this sentence shall
not require the Indemnified Party to institute or bring any Proceeding against
a third party). In any case where an Indemnified Party later recovers under
any insurance policy or other collateral source or later realizes or receives
any Tax Benefit, any amount in respect of a matter for which the Indemnified
Party was indemnified pursuant to this _Article 9_ or _Section_ __ _
6.10(a)_, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party the amount so recovered, realized or received (after deducting therefrom
reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket costs actually incurred
in connection with recovering such amount, including, in the case of any
insurance policy, any premiums paid as a result of recovering such amount),
but not in excess of the _sum_ _of_ (a) any amount previously so paid to or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such
matter and (b) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party or its Affiliates
in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter. For purposes of
the foregoing, " _Tax Benefit_ " means any reduction in any Tax realized as a
result of Losses equal to the positive difference, if any, between (i) the
liability of such Indemnified Party for Taxes with respect to the taxable year
the Losses are incurred or the subsequent taxable year not taking into
account such Losses and (ii) the liability of such Indemnified Party for Taxes
in such taxable taking into account the Losses and taking into account any
taxable income realized by such Indemnified Party on account of such Losses
or the receipt of such indemnification payment, with the Losses treated as the
last item of expense or deduction realized for such taxable year.

 

(f) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee be entitled to
receive indemnification for the same Loss more than once under this _Article
9_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ even if a claim for indemnification in respect
of such Loss has been made as a result of a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement.

(g) In no event shall any Buyer Indemnitee be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article 9_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_ with respect to a
Loss to the extent such Loss is (i) accurately reserved for on the Latest
Balance Sheet or in the footnotes to any other Financial Statements or (ii) is
included in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price.

Section 9.6 _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, for purposes of determining the amount of any Losses that
are the subject matter of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article 9_ , and for purposes of determining whether the representations and
warranties giving rise to such indemnification have been breached, each
representation and warranty in this Agreement (including those contained in
the certificates delivered pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(d)(i)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(e)(i)_) shall be read without regard and without giving
effect to the term, or, as applicable, any clause containing, "material",
"materiality" or similar phrases or clauses (including " _Material Adverse
Effect_ " or "material adverse effect") contained in such representation or
warranty; _provided_ _,_ _however_ _,_ the term, as applicable, or any clause
containing, "material", "materiality", or similar phrases or clauses
(including " _Material Adverse Effect_ " or "material adverse effect")
contained in any representation or warranty shall be

 given effect solely for purposes of (i) the definitions of " _Actual Fraud_
", " _Material Adverse Effect_ ", " _Material Contracts_ ", " _Material
Customers_ " and " _Material Suppliers_ ", and (ii) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.4(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 3.4(d)(y)_
(Financial Statements), and _Section_ __ _ 3.8(a)_ (Absence of Changes).

Section 9.7  _Procedures for Indemnification for Direct Claims_.

(a) If any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (hereinafter, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall claim to have suffered a Loss (other than in
respect of any claim asserted, demand or other Proceeding by any Person who is
not a party to this Agreement (hereinafter, a " _Third Party Claim_ ")) for
which indemnification is available under _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _Section_ __
_ 9.3_, as applicable, the Indemnified Party shall promptly (after having
actual knowledge of such claim) notify the party required to provide
indemnification (hereinafter, a " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") of such claim, which Claim Notice shall describe the facts
and circumstances giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which indemnity is
being sought, the amount or estimated amount of the Loss, if known or
reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made (provided that the
failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability to the Indemnified Party
except to the extent that such failure shall have materially and adversely
prejudiced the defense of such claim).

 

(b) If the Indemnified Party shall have received from the Indemnifying Party,
within thirty (30) days after the Indemnifying Partys receipt of a Claim
Notice made in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.7(a)_ (the " _Objection
Period_ "), a written notice setting forth the Indemnifying Partys objections
to such claim and the Indemnifying Partys reasons for such objection stated
with reasonable particularity, then the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party shall attempt to resolve such objections in good faith prior to end of
the period of time twenty (20) Business Days from the date the Indemnified
Party receives such objection (such period is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Negotiation Period_ "). After the Negotiation Period, if the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party still cannot agree on the claim, or if the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide the notice contemplated by this _Section_
__ _ 9.7(b)_ within the Objection Period, the Indemnified Party may, at any
time thereafter, commence a Proceeding against the Indemnifying Party to seek
to enforce its purported rights to indemnification from and against any Losses
that are the subject of such Claim Notice.

 

Section 9.8 _Procedures for Indemnification for Third Party Claims_.

 

(a) Any Indemnified Party seeking indemnification pursuant to this _Article 9_
in respect of any Third Party Claim shall give the Indemnifying Party from
whom indemnification with respect to such claim is sought prompt written
notice of such Third Party Claim, which Claim Notice shall describe the facts
and circumstances giving rise to such Loss, the basis upon which indemnity is
being sought, the amount or estimated amount of the Loss, if known or
reasonably ascertainable at the time such claim is made, and shall include
copies of any documents served on the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Third Party Claim (provided that the failure by the Indemnified Party to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any Liability to the Indemnified Party except to the extent that such failure
shall have materially and adversely prejudiced the defense of such claim).

(b) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within thirty
(30) days thereafter, to defend the Indemnified Party against, and assume the
defense of, the Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and
expense, including the employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party (it being agreed that, in the case that the Indemnifying
Party is a Seller, Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Kirkland and Ellis International LLP
shall be deemed to be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) and
the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense
(and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over the
defense) of a Third Party Claim if: (A) such Third Party Claim involves
criminal allegations; (B) such Third Party Claim demands injunctive or other
equitable relief; (C) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, based on
the advice of outside legal counsel, that it would be inappropriate for a
single counsel to represent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party in connection with such Third Party Claim under applicable standards of
legal ethics; (D) such Third Party Claim (together with all other claims
against the Indemnifying Party and its Affiliates that are the subject of
unresolved Claim Notices) seeks damages in excess of the then applicable
remaining portion of the Cap; or (E) the insurer under the RandW Policy is
entitled and has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim in
accordance with the RandW Policy. The Indemnifying Party shall keep the
Indemnified Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense
or is not permitted to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall keep the
Indemnifying Party) (the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, in each
case, that is not assuming the defense, the " _Non-Defending Party_")
reasonably apprised of the status of any matter the defense of which they are
maintaining, including settlement offers, with respect to the Third Party
Claim and permit the Non-Defending Party, to participate in the defense of the
Third Party Claim (in either case, at the Non-Defending Partys cost and
expense). So long as the Indemnifying Party is entitled to control the defense
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_ and is diligently conducting the
defense of the Third Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be responsible for any attorneys fees or other expenses incurred by the
Indemnified Party regarding its participation in the defense of the Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party exercises its right to defend under
this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_, the Indemnifying Party shall not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party may compromise or settle any Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party so long as such
compromise or settlement (i) only involves the payment of monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Party and does not include any
requirement that the Indemnified Party take or refrain from taking any
actions other than compliance with any nondisclosure obligations related to
the terms of such settlement contained in the settlement agreement, (ii)
unconditionally and irrevocably releases the Indemnified Party from
all liabilities with respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) does not
involve any statement, finding or admission of any fault of, breach of
contract by, or violation of Law by, the Indemnified Party; (iv) includes a
customary confidentiality obligation by the third party claimant of the terms
of the settlement in any settlement agreement; and (v) the consent of the
carrier of the RandW Policy is not required under the RandW Policy. The
Indemnified Party shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or
settlement of any Third Party Claims made without its consent (if such consent
is required by this _Section_ __ _ 9.8(b)_). The Indemnified Party shall in
no event settle or

 compromise (or consent to the settlement or compromise of) any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

(c) The Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the
other hand, shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate
in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder and each Party (or a duly authorized
representative of such party) shall (and shall cause the their respective
Representatives to) furnish such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

 

Section 9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything else contained in
this Agreement to the contrary but subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.16_, from
and after the Closing, except in the case of Actual Fraud, indemnification
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 9_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the parties hereto for any
inaccuracy in or breach or nonfulfillment of, as applicable, any
representation warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
for any matter arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including with
respect to any of the tax matters set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.10_). Except
as otherwise provided in this _Article 9_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.10(a)_, or in
the case of Actual Fraud, from and after the Closing, Buyer, on its behalf
and the other Buyer Indemnitees, hereby waives any right, whether arising at
law or in equity, to seek contribution, cost recovery, Losses or any other
recourse or remedy from any Seller.

Section 10.15 _Jurisdiction and Venue_.

 

(a) Each Party (a) irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and
complaint and any other process in any action or proceeding relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or
any of its properties or assets, in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
10.15_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Law, that
such process may be served in the manner of giving notices in _Section_ __ _

applicable Law, (b) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits
itself and its properties and assets in any action or proceeding to the
exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware (the " _Chancery Court_ ") and any state appellate court
therefrom located within the State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy
arises out of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any
Order in respect thereof, (c) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or
defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (d) agrees that any actions or proceedings arising in
connection with this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby shall be brought, tried and determined only in
the Chancery Court and any state appellate court therefrom located within the
State of Delaware (or, only if the Chancery Court declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware), (e) waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have
to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to
plead or claim the same and (f) agrees that it will not bring any action
relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each Party agrees that a final Order in any action or proceeding in such
courts as provided above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the Order or in any other manner provided by
applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties hereto agrees (on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates) that it will not bring or support any
suit, Legal Proceeding, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or
description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or tort or
otherwise, against the Financing Sources under the Debt Financing Commitments
in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing Commitments or any other
letter or agreement related to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
(and appellate courts thereof) or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested solely in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts

and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such

exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would

 



148

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including _Section_
__ _ 6.12_ and Buyers obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement if it is required to do so hereunder), in each
case without posting a bond or undertaking and without proof of damages and
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law
or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when
expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that
the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 Section 10.17 _Waiver of Conflicts_. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP
has acted as legal counsel to Sellers, their Affiliates and the Group
Companies prior to the Closing, and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act
as legal counsel to Sellers and their Affiliates (which will no longer include
the Group Companies) after the Closing, Buyer hereby waives, on its own behalf
and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP representing Sellers and/or their
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Buyer, any
Group Company or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Documents. In addition, all communications involving
attorney-client confidences between any Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the course of the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to Sellers and
their Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the Group
Companies shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files
of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to engagement, whether or not the Closing
shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon
and after the Closing, (i) Sellers and their Affiliates (and not the Group
Companies) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to such engagement, and none of the Group Companies shall be a holder
thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of
such engagement constitute property of the client, only Sellers and their
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall hold such property rights
and (iii) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Group
Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Kirkland and
Ellis LLP and any of the Group Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Group
Companies or any of their Affiliates and a third party (other than a Party or
any of its Affiliates) after the Closing, the Group Companies may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential attorney-
client communications by Kirkland and Ellis LLP to such third party.

 

Section 10.18 _Limitation on Damages; Rescission_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth herein, no Party shall be liable for (and the term
Loss shall not include) any punitive, special, or exemplary damages relating
to any breach of this Agreement, except to the extent payable pursuant to a
Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, Losses under Article 9 shall
be limited to the Losses available for breach of contract. No breach of any
representation,

 



149

 warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or in any Ancillary
Document shall give rise to any right on the part of Buyer or Sellers, after
Closing, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 10.19 _Steiner Leisure Guarantee_. Steiner Leisure absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment and performance
obligations of Sellers under this Agreement on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (collectively, the " _Guaranteed
Seller Obligations_ "). The foregoing obligation constitutes a continuing
guarantee of payment and performance. Neither Buyer nor, in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ and _Article 9_ , any other Buyer Indemnitee, need
attempt to collect or cause the performance of any obligation guaranteed
hereunder from any other Seller or any other Person prior to enforcing its
rights against Steiner Leisure. Steiner Leisure hereby waives (to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law) notice of acceptance of this guaranty and
notice of any liability to which it may apply, and waives promptness,
diligence, presentment, demand or payment, protest, notice of dishonor or
nonpayment, suit or taking of other Proceeding by Buyer or, in the case of
_Section_ __ _ 6.10_ and _Article 9_, any other Buyer Indemnitee against, or
any other notice to, any Person liable therefor. The guarantees set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 10.19_ will remain in full force and effect, and will be
binding upon Steiner Leisure, until all of the Guaranteed Seller Obligations
have been satisfied in full.

 

Section 10.20 _Seller Representative_.

 

(a) Steiner Leisure is hereby appointed, authorized and empowered to act as a
representative for the benefit of Sellers, as the exclusive agent and
attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Seller, in connection with and to
facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including pursuant to any Ancillary Documents, which shall include the power
and authority:

(i) to execute and deliver any Ancillary Documents (with such modifications
or changes therein as to which the Seller Representative, in its sole and
absolute, discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to such amendments or
modifications thereto as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion,
determines to be desirable;

(ii) to execute and deliver such waivers and consents in connection with
this Agreement and any Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as the Seller Representative, in
its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable;

of Sellers (including the Seller Representative, in its capacity as a Seller)
and to enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Seller
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Document or the transactions provided for herein
or therein, and to take any and all actions which the Seller Representative
believes are necessary or appropriate under this Agreement and/or any
Ancillary Document for and on behalf of Sellers, including asserting or
pursuing any Proceeding or investigation against Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, defending any Proceedings or investigations by the Buyer
Indemnitees, consenting to, compromising or

 settling any such Proceedings or investigations, conducting negotiations
with Buyer and its representatives regarding such Proceeding or
investigations, and, in connection therewith, to: (A) assert or institute any
Proceeding or investigation; (B) investigate, defend, contest or litigate any
Proceeding or investigation initiated by Buyer or any other Person, or by any
Governmental Entity against the Seller Representative and/or any Seller and
receive process on behalf of any or all Sellers in any such Proceeding or
investigation and compromise or settle on such terms as the Seller
Representative shall determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases
and discharges with respect to, any such Proceeding or investigation; (C)
file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Seller Representative may
deem advisable or necessary; and (D) file and prosecute appeals from any
decision, judgment or award rendered in any such Proceeding or investigation,
it being understood that the Seller Representative shall not have any
obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any
failure to take any such actions; 

(iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of any Seller and/or the Seller
Representative arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
failure to act on the part of the Seller Representative, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement or in any Ancillary Document, shall be deemed a
waiver of any such right or interest by the Seller Representative or by such
Seller unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party or by the
Seller Representative; and

 

(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Seller
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary
or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and all Ancillary Documents.

(b) Buyer shall have the right to rely upon all actions taken or omitted to
be taken by the Seller Representative pursuant to this Agreement and/or any
Ancillary Document, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally binding
upon Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same.

(c) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Seller, and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller Representative may resign as the
Seller Representative at any time by providing written notice to Buyer, which
resignation shall become effective upon appointment of a successor Seller
Representative by Steiner Leisure. All power, authority, rights, privileges
and obligations conferred in this Agreement to a Seller Representative shall
apply to any successor Seller Representative.

 

Section 10.21 _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final
prospectus of HYAC, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-220733) on October 25,
2017 and dated as of October 24, 2017 (the " _Prospectus_ "). Sellers, the
Holding Companies, and the Group Companies understand that HYAC has
established a trust account (the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the

 



151

   ##### Table of Contents

   

 

 proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of HYACs public
stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by HYACs underwriters,
the " _Public Stockholders_ "), and that, except as otherwise described in the
Prospectus, HYAC may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the
Public Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their HYAC shares in
connection with the consummation of HYACs initial business combination (as
such term is used in the Prospectus) (the " _Business Combination_ ") or in
connection with an extension of its deadline to consummate a Business
Combination, (b) to the Public Stockholders if HYAC fails to consummate a
Business Combination within twenty four (24) months after the closing of the
IPO, (c) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust
Account, as necessary to pay for any franchise and income taxes, or (d) to
HYAC after or concurrently with the consummation of a Business Combination.
For and in consideration of HYAC entering into this Agreement, and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, each Seller hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates (including the Holding Companies and the Group Companies) that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Sellers
nor any of their Affiliates (including the Holding Companies and the
Group Companies) do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right, title,
interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account or
distributions therefrom, or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim
arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this
Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between HYAC or its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Sellers, the Holding Companies, the
Group Companies or their respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any
other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract,
tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims
are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). Each
Seller on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Holding Companies
and the Group Companies) hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that
such Seller and its Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including
any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising
out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with HYAC or its
Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including
for an alleged breach of any agreement with HYAC or its Affiliates). Each
Seller agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to
this Agreement and specifically relied upon by HYAC and its Affiliates to
induce HYAC to enter in this Agreement, and such Seller further intends and
understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against such
Seller and each of its Affiliates (including the Holding Companies and the
Group Companies) under applicable Law. To the extent any Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including any Group Company or Holding Company) commences
any Proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of
any matter relating to HYAC or its Representatives, which Proceeding seeks, in
whole or in part, monetary relief against HYAC or its Representatives, each
Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Sellers and their Affiliates
(including the Holding Companies and the Group Companies) sole remedy shall be
