Financing collectively referred to as the &#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;). Each of the Financing Commitments is a legal, valid and binding obligation of HYAC or Dory Parent, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of HYAC, the other parties thereto. Each
of the Financing Commitments is in full force and effect, and none of the Financing Commitments has been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and no such amendment or modification is contemplated
(except for amendments, restatements, supplements or other modifications to add additional agents thereto). HYAC is not in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in any of the Financing Commitments, and no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach, default or failure to satisfy any condition precedent set forth therein. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties contained in <U>Article 3</U> and <U>Article 4</U> in all material respects and the performance by Sellers of their respective obligations to be performed prior to the Closing hereunder in all material respects, HYAC (i)&nbsp;has no

makes any of the representations or warranties of HYAC or Dory Parent in any of the Financing Commitments inaccurate in any material respect and (iii)&nbsp;has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be made available on the Closing Date. Neither any Investor nor any Lender has notified HYAC of its intention to
terminate all or any portion of the Financing Commitments or not to provide the Financing. The net cash proceeds from the Financing, together with the proceeds from HYAC&#146;s trust account, will be sufficient to consummate the transactions
