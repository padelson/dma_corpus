 **EQUITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

  



  

This Equity Purchase Agreement, dated as of July 29, 2004, is made between
Target Corporation, a Minnesota corporation ("Target"), and
Mervyns Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("Buyer").

  



  

 **Recitals**

  



  

A. Target owns all of the outstanding capital stock (the "Shares") of
Mervyns, a California corporation ("Mervyns").

  



  

B. Mervyns owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Mervyns Brands,
Inc., a Minnesota corporation ("Brands" and, together with Mervyns, referred
to as the "Companies"), which owns intellectual property used by Mervyns in
the operation of its business.

  



  

C. For purposes of this Agreement, "Target Affiliate" means Target or any
affiliate of Target (other than the Companies).

  



  

D. Prior to the Closing, Target shall cause Mervyns to be converted from a
California corporation to a California limited liability company and Brands
to be converted from a Minnesota corporation to a Minnesota limited liability
company.

  



  

E. Target desires to sell, and Buyer desires to purchase, all of the
outstanding equity securities of Mervyns (the "Securities") on the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

 **Agreement**

  



  

The parties hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Purchase and Sale of the Securities; Pur_ _chase Price_.

  



  

(a) _Generally_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Target will sell, transfer, and deliver the
Securities to Buyer as of the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2(a)),
and Buyer will purchase the Securities from Target, free and clear of all
liens, claims, options, charges, encumbrances, security interests, rights of
third parties, and restrictions of any kind.

  



  

(b) _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Securities is
$1,175,000,000 in cash (the "Purchase Price"), payable as set forth in
Section 2(b), and subject to adjustment as set forth in Section 2(c).
To compensate Target for the Closing occurring after the Cut-Off Date (as
defined in Section 2(a)), Buyer shall pay Target at Closing an additional
amount (the "Closing Date Interest") equal to interest on the Purchase
Price, calculated on the basis of the number of days (excluding the Closing
Date) by which the Closing follows the Cut-Off Date and otherwise in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2(c)(v).

  



  

2. _Closing; Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _Closing Date; Effective Time_. The closing (the "Closing") of the
purchase and sale of the Securities shall be held at the offices of Kirkland
and Ellis LLP, Citigroup Center, 153 East 53rd Street, New York, New York
10022, at 10:00 a.m. New York time on August 30, 2004 (or, if the conditions
to Closing set forth in Section 3 shall not have been satisfied or waived by
the appropriate party by such date, subject to the provisions of Section 14,
at 10:00 a.m. New York time on the first Monday that is a business day to
occur following the date on which all of the conditions to Closing set forth
in Section 3 shall have been satisfied or waived), or at such other place,
time and day as the parties may agree. The date on which the Closing shall
occur is referred to as the "Closing Date," although the transfer of the
Securities shall be effective as of 11:59 p.m. Minneapolis time (the
"Effective Time") on the first Saturday immediately preceding the Closing
Date (such Saturday being referred to herein as the "Cut-Off Date").

  



  

(b) _Closing Deliveries_. At the Closing:

  



  

(i) Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price, plus the Closing Date Interest, to
Target;

  



  

(ii) Target shall deliver to Buyer (A) **** a stock certificate
representing the Shares **,** marked cancelled, and (B) a unit certificate
representing the Securities, duly endorsed or accompanied by a duly executed
assignment separate from certificate in form suitable for transfer of the
Securities to Buyer, effective as of the Effective Time; and

  



  

(iii) each party shall deliver the documents required to be delivered by it
under Section 3.

  



  

(c) _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Target shall prepare and deliver
to Buyer a statement (the "Statement") setting forth Net Assets (as defined
below) as of the close of business on the Cut-Off Date (the determination of
Net Assets, as it may be adjusted under this Section 2(c) in the event of a
Notice of Disagreement, is referred to as "Final Net Assets"). Buyer shall
reasonably assist Target and its representatives in the preparation of the
Statement and shall provide Target and its representatives reasonable access
at all reasonable times to the personnel, properties, and books and records
of the Companies for such purpose.

  



  

(ii) The Statement shall become final and binding upon the parties on the
30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives written notice
of its disagreement ("Notice of Disagreement") to Target before such date.
 A Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this Section 2(c)(ii) may be submitted
only if, assuming all of Buyers assertions therein were sustained, an
adjustment to the Purchase Price would be required under Section 2(c)(v), and
the Notice of Disagreement must set forth Buyers determination of Final Net
Assets and specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement with
Targets determination. The only disagreements that may be set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this Section 2(c)(ii) are those that
relate to any claimed inconsistencies between the principles used in the
preparation of the Statement and the principles used in the preparation of
the Interim Statement of Net Assets (as defined in Section 4(e)) that are not
provided for in the definition of Net Assets in Section 2(c)(vi) or errors in
mathematical computation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 2(c), no disagreement set forth in the Notice of Disagreement may
relate to the principles used in the preparation of the Statement and
the Interim Statement of Net Assets so long as those principles are
consistently applied. If a valid Notice of Disagreement is received by
Target in a timely manner, then the Statement and the Final Net Assets (as
finally determined in accordance with clause (A) or (B) below) shall become
final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (A) the date the parties
resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to all matters
specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (B) the date any disputed matters
are finally resolved in writing by the Arbitrator (as defined below).

  



  

(iii) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Notice of
Disagreement, Target and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in
the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the end of such 30-day period, Target and
Buyer have not reached agreement on all such matters, then the matters that
remain in dispute shall be promptly submitted to an arbitrator (the
"Arbitrator") for review and resolution. The Arbitrator shall be a
nationally recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed
upon by the parties in writing, provided that the Arbitrator will not be an
accounting firm used by either Target or Buyer for audit or valuation
purposes. The procedures for the arbitration shall be determined by the
Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall render a decision resolving the matters in
dispute within 30 days following completion of the submissions to the
Arbitrator. Any item not specifically referred to in the Notice of
Disagreement shall be deemed final and binding on Buyer and Target in the
manner set forth in the Statement.  The Arbitrator shall determine Final Net
Assets based solely on presentations made by Target and Buyer (and not by
independent review).

  



  

(iv) The Non-Prevailing Party (as defined below) in any arbitration before
the Arbitrator shall pay its own expenses incurred with respect to the
arbitration and shall pay a percentage of (A) the fees and expenses of the
Arbitrator plus (B) the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) of the other party incurred with respect to the
arbitration, which percentage shall be calculated by dividing (1) an amount
equal to the difference between the Non-Prevailing Partys determination of
Final Net Assets, as submitted to the Arbitrator, and the Arbitrators
determination of Final Net Assets by (2) an amount equal to the difference
between the parties respective determinations of Final Net Assets, as
submitted to the Arbitrator. The other party shall pay the remainder of the
fees and expenses of the Arbitrator and its own expenses not required to
be paid by the Non-Prevailing Party hereunder.  A party is the "Non-
Prevailing Party" if the Arbitrators determination of Final Net Assets is
closer to the other partys determination of Final Net Assets, as submitted
to the Arbitrator, than it is to that partys determination of Final Net
Assets, as submitted to the Arbitrator. In resolving any matter specified in
the Notice of Disagreement, the Arbitrator shall not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party.

  



  

(v) For purposes of this Agreement, "Bid Net Assets" means $904,421,474. The
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which Final Net Assets
exceed 102% of the Bid Net Assets, or the Purchase Price shall be decreased
by the amount by which Final Net Assets are less than 98% of the Bid Net
Assets (the Purchase Price as increased or decreased by the adjustment
provided for in this sentence is referred to as the "Adjusted Purchase
Price"; if no such adjustment is required, then the Adjusted Purchase Price
shall equal the Purchase Price). If the Purchase Price is less than the
Adjusted Purchase Price, Buyer shall, and if the Purchase Price is more than
the Adjusted Purchase Price, Target shall, within 5 business days after the
Statement becomes final and binding on the parties, make payment to the other
party of the amount of such difference, together with interest thereon at an
annual rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate in effect as of the Friday
before the Closing Date, calculated on the actual number of days elapsed from
the Cut-Off Date to the date of payment divided by 365.

  



  

(vi) The term "Net Assets" means (A) the book value (net of appropriate
reserves) of the assets of the Companies that would be required to be
included on a consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with the
principles used in the preparation of the Interim Statement of Net Assets,
provided that the book value of all fixed assets and all intangible assets as
of the Cut-Off Date shall be determined without regard to any depreciation or
amortization thereof after the date of the Interim Statement of Net Assets,
less (B) the book value of the liabilities of the Companies that would be
required to be included on a consolidated balance sheet prepared in
accordance with the principles used in the preparation of the Interim
Statement of Net Assets, calculated on the same basis as reflected in the
relevant line items on the Interim Statement of Net Assets. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the computation of Net Assets will be done
in a manner consistent with the methods used in the preparation of the
Interim Statement of Net Assets, and if disagreements arise with respect to
individual items of inclusion and/or exclusion, the governing principle will
be that the adjustment contemplated by this Section 2(c) is intended to
analyze the economic effects of a change in Net Assets from the date of the
Interim Statement of Net Assets through the Cut-Off Date, and such change can
be appropriately measured only when the Bid Net Assets and the Final Net
Assets are computed on the same basis, except as provided above.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all receipts by
Mervyns on or before the Cut-Off Date, including cash, checks and bank
drafts (whether cleared before or after the Effective Time), and proceeds
from third-party credit card or debit card transactions (whether posted
before or after the Effective Time) shall be excluded from the Statement, and
Buyer shall cause payment in an aggregate amount equal to such receipts to be
made by Buyer or Mervyns to Target immediately after Target makes demand
therefor; provided that this sentence shall not affect Targets covenant
regarding register cash set forth in Section 5(b)(iii). Net Assets shall not
include as assets any assets transferred by Mervyns to a Target Affiliate
before the Effective Time and shall not include as liabilities any Target
Taxes (as defined in Section 4(g)(i)) or Transfer Taxes (as defined in
Section 10(b)). For the avoidance of doubt, Net Assets shall not include any
assets or liabilities of the type that are excluded from the Interim
Statement of Net Assets due to the "transaction adjustments" set forth on
_Exhibit A_.

  



  

(d) _Certain Assets_. If Buyer is prevented from acquiring the indirect
ownership of, or leasehold interest in, one or more parcels of Real Estate or
indirect ownership of other assets of the Companies due to an injunction or
court order, then (i) all assets and liabilities relating to any such parcel
or such other assets shall be excluded from the calculations of Bid Net
Assets and Final Net Assets, (ii) the parcel or other asset will be
transferred out of the Companies to Target or its designee and (iii) the
parties shall negotiate a mutually acceptable reduction to the Adjusted
Purchase Price equal to the fair market value of such ownership or leasehold
interest. If the parties cannot agree on the such fair market value, then the
parties shall resolve their differences pursuant to the procedures set forth
in Sections 2(c)(iii) and (iv), provided that the Arbitrator shall be a
mutually acceptable real estate appraisal firm rather than an accounting
firm.

  



  

(e) _Section 1031 Like-Kind Exchange_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, Target may elect to effectuate, directly or indirectly, the
sale of one or more of the parcels of Owned Real Estate (the "Exchange
Assets") by means of an exchange of "like-kind" property that will qualify
under Section 1031 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (each,
an "Exchange Transaction"); Buyer shall at Targets sole cost and expense
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate in an Exchange
Transaction arranged by Target, Mervyns and a qualified exchange
intermediary (as such term is used in the Treasury Regulations promulgated
under Section 1031 of the Code) designated by Target. Target shall provide
written notice to Buyer of Targets election to effect an Exchange
Transaction no later than 10 days prior to Closing. Neither Mervyns nor Buyer
shall incur any Tax liability, any expenses or any liability of any nature in
connection with any Exchange Transaction. Neither Buyer nor Mervyns shall
be obligated to take title to any exchange property under any circumstances.
No Exchange Assets shall be transferred or deeded out of Mervyns.  Target
shall indemnify and save and hold harmless Buyer and Mervyns from any and
all liabilities arising out of or related to any Exchange Transaction. Buyer
shall, upon Targets request, and Target may, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, cause Mervyns to, execute and deliver such
documents and agreements as are reasonably necessary for the purpose of
facilitating an Exchange Transaction, and Buyer shall pay the portion of the
Purchase Price attributable to the Exchange Assets (the "Escrowed Purchase
Price") at the Closing to Targets designated qualified exchange
intermediary.  Targets right to receive the Escrowed Purchase Price shall be
limited as required by Section 1031 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder. If a tax-deferred exchange cannot be effected by
Target for any reason other than a breach by Buyer, Target shall still be
obligated to close this transaction pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
Under no circumstances shall Targets right or election to exchange any
Exchange Assets, delay closing, require Buyer or Mervyns to incur any
expense it would not have otherwise incurred (unless paid or reimbursed by
Target as provided above) or otherwise adversely affect Buyers rights
hereunder. The Escrowed Purchase Price for any parcel of Owned Real Estate
shall be the amount allocated to such Owned Real Estate as determined under
Section 10(f) below.

4. _Representations and Warranties of Targ_ _et_. Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Target to Buyer concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the "Disclosure Schedule"), Target hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

  



  

(a) _Organization and Authority_. Each of Target and, prior to the
Mervyns Conversion and the Brands Conversion, the Companies is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation. All corporate and stockholder acts and
proceedings required to be taken to authorize the execution, delivery, and
performance by Target of this Agreement and all agreements, instruments and
other documents referred to herein to be entered into by Target and the
consummation by Target of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly and properly taken. Prior to the Mervyns Conversion and
the Brands Conversion, each Company is duly qualified and in good standing to
do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of its business or the ownership, leasing, or holding of its properties
requires it to be so qualified, except where the failure to be so qualified
or in good standing does not have a Material Adverse Effect. Target has all
requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and all
agreements, instruments and other documents referred to herein to be entered
into by Target, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Target and, assuming due
authorization, execution, and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Target, enforceable against
Target in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, and other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity. As
of the Closing, all agreements, instruments and other documents referred to
herein to be entered into by Target shall have been duly executed and
delivered by Target and, assuming due authorization, execution, and delivery
of all agreements, instruments and other documents referred to herein by
Buyer, constitute valid and binding obligations of Target enforceable against
Target in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, and other similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

  



  

(b) _The Shares and Securities_. Prior to the Mervyns Conversion, Target
has good and valid title to the Shares and, after the Mervyns Conversion,
Target has good and valid title to the Securities, in either case free and
clear of any claims, liens, encumbrances, security interests, options,
charges, rights of third parties, and restrictions whatsoever and will
transfer and deliver to Buyer at Closing good and valid title to the
Securities free and clear of any liens, claims, options,
charges, encumbrances, security interest, rights of third parties, and
restrictions of any kind, except those created by Buyer and restrictions upon
transfer of the Securities other than in compliance with federal and state
law. Neither the Shares nor the Securities are subject to any voting trust
agreement or other contract, agreement, arrangement, commitment, or
understanding, including any such contract, agreement, arrangement,
commitment, or understanding restricting or otherwise relating to the voting,
dividend rights, or disposition of the Shares or Securities, other than this
Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Capitalization_. Prior to the Mervyns Conversion, the authorized
capital stock of Mervyns consisted of 20 million shares of common stock,
$1.00 par value per share, 100 of which were duly authorized, validly issued
and outstanding, and fully paid and nonassessable. After the Mervyns
Conversion, the authorized equity securities of Mervyns consists of 20
million common units, 100 of which are duly authorized, validly issued and
outstanding, and fully paid and nonassessable. Prior to the
Brands Conversion, the authorized capital stock of Brands consisted of 1,000

After the Brands Conversion, the authorized equity securities of Brands
consists of 1,000 common units, all of which are duly authorized, validly

Brands Conversion, Mervyns was the sole holder of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Brands. After the Brands Conversion, Mervyns is the
sole holder of all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Brands.
Prior to the Mervyns Conversion, the Shares constituted all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of Mervyns.  After the Mervyns
Conversion, the Securities constitute all of the issued and outstanding
equity securities of Mervyns. Prior to the Mervyns Conversion, Target
was the sole holder of the Shares. After the Mervyns Conversion, Target is
the sole holder of the Securities. Neither the Shares nor Securities nor
any shares of issued and outstanding equity securities of Brands have been
issued in violation of, or are subject to, any preemptive or subscription
rights. There are no outstanding or authorized preemptive, stock
appreciation, phantom stock or similar rights with respect to any of the
Companies. Other than as described in this Section 4(c), there are no shares
of capital stock or other equity securities of the Companies outstanding.
There are no outstanding warrants, options, agreements, convertible or
exchangeable securities, or other commitments pursuant to which Target or any
of the Companies is or may become obligated to issue, sell, or otherwise
dispose of, purchase, return, redeem, or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Companies other than this Agreement,
and there are not any equity securities of any of the Companies reserved for
issuance for any purpose. Other than Mervyns ownership of Brands,
the Companies do not directly or indirectly own any capital stock of, or
other equity interest in, any person.

  



  

(d) _Non-Contravention_. Subject to Section 4(i)(vii), the execution,
delivery, and performance by Target of this Agreement and all agreements,
instruments and other documents referred to herein to be entered into by
Target do not, and the consummation by Target of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby will not, (i) conflict with, or result in any
violation of, any provision of the articles of incorporation or by-laws of
Target or any of the Companies, or (ii) conflict with, result in any
violation of, or constitute a default under, or create a lien on any assets
of the Companies under, or result in the acceleration or termination of, or
result in a material increase in payment obligations (including, without
limitation, any change of control payments) under, any instrument, contract,
commitment, agreement or arrangement to which Target or any of the Companies
is a party or by which Target or any of the Companies or any assets of the
Companies are bound, or any judgment, order, writ, injunction, or decree to
which Target or any of the Companies has been specifically identified as
subject, or result in any violation of any statute, law, ordinance, rule, or
regulation applicable to Target, any of the Companies, or any assets of the
Companies (except where such conflict, violation, default, lien,
acceleration, termination, or increased obligations would not
materially impair the ability of Target to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or have a Material Adverse Effect). No material consent,
approval, license, permit, order, or authorization of, or registration,
declaration, or filing with, any court, administrative agency, or commission
or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Target or any of the
Companies in connection with the execution, delivery, and performance
by Target of this Agreement or the consummation by Target of the
transactions contemplated hereby other than compliance with and filings under
the HSR Act and filings with the Secretaries of State of California and
Minnesota required to effect the Mervyns Conversion and the Brands

any new governmental consents, approvals, licenses, permits, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations, or filings will be required as a

the landlord, and subject to any defects in or other matters affecting the
landlords title, Mervyns has good and marketable leasehold interests in all
Leased Real Estate leased to it, in each case free and clear of all
mortgages, liens, security interests, easements, restrictive covenants,
rights-of-way encroachments, and other encumbrances created by Mervyns or
any party claiming through Mervyns, except (A) Permitted Liens; (B)
easements, Real Estate Agreements, restrictive covenants, rights-of-
way, encroachments, purchase options, lease termination options, rights of
first refusal or first offer and other encumbrances and matters that are
included in or disclosed by the documents relating to each parcel of Real
Estate made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, shown (whether or
not deleted or insured over) on any Title Commitment, or of record; (C) any
conditions that may be shown by a current, accurate survey or physical
inspection of the Leased Real Estate; (D) mortgages, liens, security
interests or encumbrances that have been placed by any developer, landlord or
other third party on any Leased Real Estate; and (E) (1) platting,
subdivision, zoning, building, and other similar restrictions, and (2)
easements, restrictive covenants, rights-of-way, encroachments, and other
similar encumbrances not of record; provided, however, none of the items set
forth in clause (E) individually or in the aggregate materially interferes
with the continued use, occupancy and/or operation of the Leased Real Estate
substantially in the manner in which the Leased Real Estate is currently used
and operated (the "Leased Permitted Exceptions," and, together with the Owned
Permitted Exceptions, the "Permitted Exceptions"). The marketability of
title to the Leased Real Estate is subject to the Leased Permitted Exception.
Except as set forth in Section 4(i) of the Disclosure Schedule, with respect
to each of the Leases: (i) Mervyns has not given or received a written
notice of default under any Real Estate Agreement which remains uncured, and
no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with the delivery of
notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute such a breach or
default under any such Real Estate Agreement which, with respect to such
written notices or events, individually or in the aggregate, would have a
Material Adverse Effect; and (ii) the other party to such Lease is not a
Target Affiliate.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Mervyns interest in the Leased Real Estate is not encumbered by
any mortgages, deeds of trust, or security agreements created by Mervyns or
any party claiming through Mervyns.

  



  

(iii) The Real Estate comprises all of the real property owned or leased by
the Companies and used in Mervyns business.

  



  

(iv) There are no eminent domain proceedings pending (with respect to which
any Target Affiliate or any Company has been notified).

  



  

(v) Brands neither owns nor leases any real property.

  



  

(vi) "Leases" means all leases, subleases, licenses, concessions and other
agreements (written or oral) pursuant to which Mervyns or any Company holds
any Leased Real Estate.

  



  

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any
certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto, no representation or
warranty is made herein as to whether any consents, approvals, waivers,
agreements, or actions of, or (with or without lapse of time) notice to,
third parties (including governmental authorities), or fulfillment of any
conditions, are needed in respect of the Real Estate, including the Real
Estate Agreements and the Permitted Exceptions, in connection with the
purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or the direct
or indirect ownership of the Real Estate after the Effective Time.

  



  

(j) _Condition of Assets_. Except as expressly provided in Section 4(r), no
representation or warranty, direct or indirect, by implication or otherwise,
is made concerning or based upon the physical condition of the Real Estate or
any other tangible assets of the Companies, all of which are being accepted
"AS IS AND WHERE IS" by Buyer (including as to all environmental aspects
thereof, except as otherwise provided in Section  4(r)). EXCEPT AS SET FORTH
EXPRESSLY IN THIS AGREEMENT, TARGET DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY
WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS, TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE, OF THE COMPANIES,
INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF FITNESS, NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

payment of a royalty, license fee, or similar fee to any other party (other
than pursuant to a License described in Section 4(l) of the Disclosure
Schedule or the non-disclosure of which therein would not constitute a
misrepresentation under Section  4(l)), the patents, trademarks, trade names,
service marks, copyrights and other Intellectual Property used by the
Companies in the operation of their businesses (collectively, and together
with all Intellectual Property owned by any of the Companies, the "Company
Intellectual Property"), except where the failure of either Company to own or
have the right to use any such patent, trademark, trade name, service mark,

any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign (other than claims, challenges, or
questions by governmental intellectual property office examiners as part of
the application process), (B) since January 1, 2001, no other person
has claimed in writing and continues to claim the right to use in an
infringing manner any such patent, trademark, service mark, copyright or
other Intellectual Property other than pursuant to a License described
in Section 4(l) of the Disclosure Schedule or the non-disclosure of
which therein would not constitute a misrepresentation under Section 4(l),
and (C) no outstanding claims of patent, trademark, trade name, service
mark, or copyright infringement or any other violation of any Intellectual
Property have been made in writing since January 1, 2001 by any person
against either Company with respect to the right of either Company to
continue to sell any product or service or otherwise operate the Companies
businesses without payment of a royalty, license fee, or similar fee to such
person (other than payments that are currently subject to a License described
in Section 4(l) of the Disclosure Schedule or the non-disclosure of which
therein would not constitute a misrepresentation under Section 4(l)), except
in the case of clauses (A) through (C) as does not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

currently conducted does not infringe or otherwise violate any third-party

has been maintained in accordance with applicable laws, including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code and each Plan that is intended to be qualified
under the Code Section 401(a) is so qualified and nothing has occurred that
would adversely affect such qualified status.  All premiums or other
payments under the Plans listed on Section 9(b)(i) of the Disclosure Schedule

policy, contract, or arrangement maintained by Target, or by any of its

authority or instrumentality, which has not otherwise been remedied to the
extent the failure to remedy such violation has a Material Adverse Effect.

request for payment only to the extent that a person of ordinary prudence in
like circumstances would make a claim under the persons own insurance
policy.

  



  

(e) _Exclusivity_. Unless and until this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
its terms (the "Exclusivity Period"), Target agrees that Buyer shall have the

officers, directors, employees or agents (including any investment banker,
attorney or accountant retained by any of the foregoing) to, (i) solicit,

be terminated any and all contacts, discussions and negotiations with third
parties regarding any of the foregoing, and Target shall promptly notify
Buyer of any proposal with respect to the foregoing (including providing the
identity of the person making such proposal and copies of such proposal), or

exercise all renewal and extension options currently existing with respect to
all Real Estate Agreements, provided that Target shall not be required to
cause the exercise of such options if the time for exercise would not expire
prior to the Closing and except as provided in Section 5(b)(xi), shall not
sell, transfer or encumber any Real Estate or assign, sublease, encumber or
terminate any Real Estate Agreement, without Buyers prior written consent.
Target shall, from time to time and in each case upon written request and as
directed by Buyer, cause Mervyns or any other Company to exercise any other
rights of renewal or extension, rights of first offer, rights of first
refusal, or purchase options, or similar rights or options under any Real
Estate Agreement or any other material agreement with respect to the Real
Estate to which Mervyns or any other Company is a party; provided that
Target shall not be required to cause the exercise of any such rights if the
time for exercise would not expire prior to the Closing and, if Buyer has so
directed Mervyns to exercise such rights, Buyer shall provide any funds
required to be paid or deposited in connection therewith when due.  Buyer
shall indemnify Target from and against any and all actual costs incurred in
connection with the exercise of any rights by Buyer under this Section 5(f),
including, without limitation, any option or purchase price paid in
connection therewith and any exercise of any renewal right or
extension option that Target would have otherwise not exercised and such
indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing or termination of this
Agreement.

  

     

  



  

 **(g)** ** ****_Indebtedness_** **. Each of the Companies shall have
no outstanding Indebtedness as of immediately prior to the Closing Date other
than as set forth in Section 5(g) of the Disclosure Schedule. As applied to
each of the Companies, "Indebtedness" means indebtedness for borrowed money,
whether current or funded, or secured or unsecured, including without
limitation, (i) all indebtedness of any such Company for the deferred
purchase price of property or services, whether or not represented by a note,
(ii) all indebtedness of any such Company created or arising under any
conditional sale or other title retention agreement with respect to property
acquired by such person (even though the rights and remedies of the seller or
lender under such agreement in the event of default are limited to
repossession or sale of such property), (iii) all indebtedness of any such
Company secured by a purchase money mortgage or other lien to secure all or
part of the purchase price of the property subject to such mortgage or lien,
(iv) all interest, fees and other expenses and amounts owed with respect to
the indebtedness referred to above, and (v) all indebtedness referred to

loss. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Indebtedness" shall not include
customer down-payments for goods or services provided or to be provided by
each of the Companies, or any intercompany indebtedness (which pursuant to
Section 8(g) hereof shall be paid in full or canceled).**

  



  

 **(h)** ** ****_No Post-Conversion Tax Election_** **. After the Mervyns
Conversion and Brands Conversion, neither Target nor any Company will make
any election or take any action to cause either Company to be treated as a
corporation for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes.**

by general principles of equity.

  



  

(b) _Non-Contravention_. The execution, delivery, and performance by Buyer of
this Agreement and all agreements, instruments and other documents referred

default under, any instrument, contract, commitment, agreement,
or arrangement to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer or the property
or assets of Buyer is bound, or any judgment, order, writ, injunction, or
decree to which Buyer has been specifically identified as subject, or result
in any violation of any statute, law, ordinance, rule, or regulation
applicable to Buyer or its property or assets (except where such conflict,

approval, license, permit, order, or authorization of, or registration,
declaration, or filing with, any court, administrative agency or commission,
or other governmental authority or instrumentality, domestic or foreign, is

contemplated hereby.

(e) _Securities Laws_. The **Securities** purchased by Buyer pursuant to
this Agreement are being acquired for investment only and not with a view to

(a) _Consents_.  Buyer acknowledges that (i) certain consents (including
consents contingent on the fulfillment of certain conditions), approvals,
waivers, agreements, or actions of, or (with or without lapse of time) notice
to, third parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
may be required under instruments, contracts, commitments, agreements, or
arrangements (the "Required Consents"), which Required Consents have not been

Closing, and (ii) certain new governmental franchises, approvals, permits,
licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances, and similar rights
may be required in order for Buyer to conduct the businesses of the
Companies following the Cut-Off Date in the same manner in which the

liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of or relating to the failure to
obtain any Required Consents or any such new governmental franchises,
approvals, permits licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances,
or similar rights that may be required **so long as Target has not otherwise
breached any of its representations and warranties in Section 4(d)**.
No representation, warranty, or covenant of Target contained herein shall
be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not
satisfied, based on (A) the failure to obtain any such Required Consents or
any such new governmental franchises, approvals, permits licenses,
orders, registrations, certificates, variances, or similar rights, or (B)
any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding, or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any such Required Consents or any such new governmental
franchises, approvals, permits licenses, orders, registrations, certificates,
variances, or similar rights **so long as Target has not otherwise breached
any of its representations and warranties in Sections 4(d)** ; provided,
however, that nothing stated herein shall supersede the conditions set forth
in Section **s** 3(a)(iv), 3(a)(v), 3(b)(ii), or 3(b)(iii) or the
obligations of Target under this Section 8(a). Target shall cooperate with
Buyer in any reasonable manner in connection with Buyer obtaining any
Required Consents and any new governmental franchises, approvals, permits
licenses, orders, registrations, certificates, variances, or similar rights;
provided, however, that such cooperation shall not include any requirement of
any Target Affiliate to make any payment or offer or grant any accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party **unless, in the case of payment,
Buyer makes such payment and, in any other case, Target shall cooperate only
if Buyer agrees to reimburse such Target Affiliate for its reasonable out-of-
pocket costs with respect thereto and such reimbursement would fully
compensate such Target Affiliate for the offer or grant of
the accommodation**.

  



  

(b) _Cooperation_ _; Further Assurances_.

respective affiliates and the officers, employees, agents, and

ownership of the **Securities**  to Buyers ownership of the **Securities**
and to minimize any disruption to the respective businesses of Target or
Buyer that might result from the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party
shall reimburse the other for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (but not
compensation payments to employees) incurred in assisting the other pursuant
to this Section 8(b). Neither party shall be required by this Section 8(b)
to take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its
or its affiliates businesses.

  



  

(ii) Without limiting the provisions of any other Section hereof, after the
Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Buyer and Target agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other and each others officers, employees,
agents, and representatives access, during normal business hours, to such
information relating to the Companies and such other assistance as is
reasonably necessary for financial reporting, accounting, and other
reasonably appropriate purposes; provided, however, that such access or
assistance shall not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Target,
Buyer, or the Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Target and its representatives shall have the right to reasonable access to
the books and records maintained by the Companies or by Buyer relating to the
Companies at reasonable times during normal working hours upon reasonable
notice to Buyer for so long after the Closing as Buyer or the Companies
retain such books and records for the purpose of examining such books and
records and making copies thereof **, provided that** Buyer shall
retain books and records **relating to Taxes or Tax Returns** for at least
seven years after the Closing and **its other** books and records in
accordance with its customary document retention policies, and, if at least
seven years but less than ten years after the Closing, Buyer or the Companies
desire to destroy such books and records relating to Taxes or Tax Returns,

either rejects such written offer or fails to respond to such written offer
within 30 days after receipt thereof.

  



  

(iii) From time to time after the Closing, as and when requested by a party
hereto, the other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to

forth in Section 8(a)), as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary
or desirable to give full effect to this Agreement.

  



  

(iv) Nothing in this Section 8(b) shall affect the rights and obligations of
the Target Affiliates and Buyer under the Transition Services Agreement.

  



  

(c) _Certain IP_ _Matters_.

entering into or conducting contractual relationships, to make **reasonably**
clear to all other applicable parties that Buyer or one of the Companies,
rather than any Target Affiliate, is the party entering into or conducting

authority to, hold themselves out as officers, employees, or agents of any
Target Affiliate.

  



  

(iii) Buyer shall cause the Companies to cease promptly, but in no event
later than 90 days after the **Closing**  Date, using any packaging materials

(iv) Mervyns shall have the right to exhaust all inventories of finished
products owned by Mervyns as of the **Closing Date** that contain as part

(vi) Other than as permitted under clauses (ii) through (iv) above, Buyer
shall cause the Companies not to use, without the prior written consent of

(vii) Target will cause the Companies to enter into a short term trademark
and trade name license agreement that grants the Target Affiliates the right

shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC or the
DOJ, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to comply promptly with any
such inquiry or request. Each of Target and Buyer will use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the expiration or early termination of the waiting
period required under the HSR Act as a condition to the purchase and sale of
the **Securities** and shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend
against any action of the FTC or the DOJ to enjoin the sale of the
**Securities** to Buyer.  Nothing stated in this Agreement shall require
Buyer to agree to, or permit Target to agree to, the divestiture of any
assets of Buyer or any of the Companies to obtain termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act.

  



  

(g) _Intercompany Acc_ _ounts_. All intercompany accounts **in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time** between any
Target Affiliate, on the one hand, and either Company, on the other hand,
shall, be paid in full or canceled **(as determined by Target)** without
payment effective at or before the Effective Time. The Bid Net Assets and
the Final Net Assets shall be determined without giving effect to any
intercompany accounts or the payment or cancellation thereof.

  



  

(h) _Transition Serv_ _ices_. At the Closing, one or more Target Affiliates
and Mervyns shall enter into an agreement substantially in the form of
_Exhibit H_ providing for certain transition services (including software
licenses and sublicenses) by such Target Affiliates for Mervyns after the
Effective Time (the "Transition Services Agreement").

  



  

(i) _Certain Contra_ _cts_.

  



  

(i) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8(i)(v), with respect to each
contract or agreement that relates solely to the operation of Mervyns
business or the ownership of its assets to which Target but not Mervyns is a
party, Target will use reasonable commercial efforts before the
**Closing Date** to cause such contract or agreement to be assigned
to Mervyns.

  



  

(ii) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8(i)(v), with respect to each
contract or agreement that relates solely to the operation of Mervyns
business or the ownership of its assets to which both Target and Mervyns are
parties, Target will assign all of its rights and obligations thereunder to
Mervyns as of the **Effective Time**.

  



  

(iii) With respect to each contract or agreement that does not relate solely
to the operation of Mervyns business or the ownership of its assets to which
Target and Mervyns are parties, Mervyns will assign all of its rights
and obligations thereunder to Target as of the **Effective Time**.

  



  

(iv) With respect to each contract or agreement entered into by Target on
behalf of it and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Buyer acknowledges that **,
except as set forth herein,** neither Company has any rights thereunder and
Buyer will not permit either Company to claim otherwise.

  



  

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 8(i)(i) or (ii), as
of the **Effective Time** , Mervyns shall assign to Target all rights
and obligations of Mervyns under any contract or agreement (including a
license agreement) relating to software of any kind, other than the software
identified in _Exhibit I_ as being "Licensed to Mervyns," (a "Retained
Software Agreement") to which Mervyns is a party.

  



  

(vi) As of the **Effective Time** , Mervyns shall assign to a Target
Affiliate all lease agreements relating to stores or distribution centers
formerly operated by Mervyns that have been closed before the **Closing**
**Date** , other than the Hialeah, Florida store.

  



  

(vii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8(i), if (A)
any contract or agreement is not capable of being assigned as provided in
this Section 8(i) in the absence of the approval, consent, or waiver of
any other person without conflicting with, violating, constituting a default
under, or breaching the contract or agreement, and (B) all necessary
approvals, consents, and waivers of all parties to the contract or agreement
have not been obtained at or before the Closing, then the contract or
agreement shall not be assigned; provided that the purported assignee shall
assume the obligations and liabilities of the purported assignor under the
contract or agreement after the  **Effective Time** (but not the contract or
agreement itself), and the claims, rights, and benefits of such assignor
arising under the contract or agreement or resulting therefrom after the
**Effective Time** (but not the contract or agreement itself) shall be
assigned to such assignee (and any benefits received by such assignor
therefrom after the **Effective Time** shall immediately be transferred by
such assignor to such assignee), and such assignor shall, following the
Closing, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist such assignee in
attempting to obtain the necessary approvals, consents, and waivers, and
shall promptly execute all documents necessary to complete the transfer of
the contract or agreement if such approvals, consents, and waivers are
obtained.

  



  

(viii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8(i),
**neither party **shall be required to make any payments or offer or grant
any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party to obtain any
approval, consent, or waiver to any assignment of a contract or agreement
hereunder **, unless, in the case of payment, the other party makes such
payment and, in any other case, the other party agrees to reimburse such
party and its affiliates for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs
with respect thereto and such reimbursement would fully compensate such party
and its affiliates for the offer or grant of the accommodation**.

  



  

(j) _Intercompany Agreem_ _ents_. Except for agreements relating to any
parcel of Real Estate, the **licenses granted** pursuant to Section 8(c),
**the Transition Services Agreement, the agreements set forth on Section
8(j) of the Disclosure Schedule **and as provided in Section 10(e), all
contracts, agreements, arrangements **, obligations and liabilities** between
any Target Affiliate, on the one hand, and either Company, on the other hand,
shall automatically be terminated without liability **, waived and released**
as of the **Closing**   **Date** , including the amended and restated
merchant services agreement dated February 1, 2004 between Target National
Bank and Mervyns **, the License and IP Brokerage Agreement, dated February
2, 2003, between Brands and Target Brands, Inc**. **and the Target-Mervyn s
License.**

  



  

(k) _Guarantee Arrang_ _ements_. Following the **Closing**  Date, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to do all things necessary or desirable
to cause (i) the applicable Target Affiliate to be unconditionally released
from any guarantee or other obligation to ensure the performance of either
Company made or given by any Target Affiliate or (ii) Buyer or one or more of
its affiliates to be substituted for the applicable Target Affiliate as
guarantor under any such guarantee or other obligation; provided, however,
that the foregoing provisions of this sentence shall not apply with respect
to any guarantee or other obligation made or given by Target to a third-party
vendor or licensor in connection with securing consent to Targets provision
of the transition services contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement.
Buyer shall execute and deliver such documents, certificates, agreements, and
other instruments and to take such other actions as may be **reasonably**
necessary or desirable in order to implement such release or substitution.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8(k), all liabilities
and obligations (including those referenced in the above proviso) of any
Target Affiliate under such guarantees and obligations shall be subject to
Section 11(b)(iii), and, with respect to those referenced in the above
proviso, also to the indemnification provisions of the Transition Services
Agreement.

  



  

(l) _Disclosure Supple_ _ments_. From time to time before the Closing,
Target may supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any
matter that would make any representation or warranty set forth in Section
4 inaccurate if updated immediately before the Closing or as is necessary
to correct any information in the Disclosure Schedule or in
any representation or warranty of Target made in Section 4. For purposes of
determining the fulfillment of the condition set forth in Section 3(a)(i) as
of the Closing and the accuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in Section 4 if the Closing does not occur, the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to include only that information contained therein on the
date of this Agreement and shall be deemed to exclude any information
contained in any subsequent supplement or amendment thereto.  However, for
purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations or warranties of
Target contained in Section 4 or the liability of Target with respect thereto
under Section 11(a)(i) should the Closing occur, the Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to include all information contained in any subsequent
supplement or amendment thereto.

  



  

(m) _Minnesota St_ _ores_. Buyer acknowledges that, before the Closing, Target
will cause ownership **solely** of the nine Mervyns stores located in the
State of Minnesota (the "Minnesota Stores") to be transferred to one or more
Target Affiliates or third parties (with the proceeds of any such transfer to
be for the account of Target). For all purposes under this Agreement,
all references to one or more Companies or to Mervyns (including in Section
4) shall be deemed to exclude the Minnesota Stores in all respects. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Minnesota Stores will be
excluded from the definitions of "Owned Real Estate," "Leased Real Estate,"
and "Real Estate" for all purposes under this Agreement; all contracts and
agreements relating to the Minnesota Stores shall be assigned to a Target
Affiliate or to a third party; all inventory, equipment, furniture, and other
**tangible** assets located at the Minnesota Stores shall be transferred to a
Target Affiliate or to a third party; and no employee located at a Minnesota
Store shall be subject to Section 9.

  



  

(n) _Software Issu_ _es_.

  



  

(i) Prior to the Closing, Target and Buyer shall cooperate to obtain written
consents and acknowledgements from each third-party licensor of each piece of
software identified in _Exhibit I_ as being "Licensed to Target" evidencing
that Target can assign the applicable license agreement (or applicable
portion thereof) to Mervyns in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided, however, that Target shall have no obligation to
pay money or grant any accommodation in order to obtain any such consents
and acknowledgements.

  



  

(ii) Except for items for which consent and acknowledgement under Section
8(n)(i) has been obtained prior to the Closing: (A) prior to the Closing,
Target and Buyer shall cooperate to obtain written consents and
acknowledgements from each third-party licensor of each piece of software
identified on Section 8(n) of the Disclosure Schedule evidencing that
Mervyns has or will have by the Closing either a license with such third-
party licensor, or a sublicense under the Transition Services Agreement,
sufficient to allow Mervyns to use such software during the Transition
Period (as such term is defined in the Transition Services Agreement) and to
allow a change of control of Mervyns without obligating Target or Mervyns
to remove such software from any equipment before such change of control;
provided, however, that Target shall have no obligation to pay money or grant
any accommodation in order to obtain any such consents and acknowledgements;
and (B) with respect to any item identified on Section 8(n) of the Disclosure
Schedule for which the applicable third-party licensor would not provide such
consents and acknowledgements prior to the Closing, then Target shall have
the right to remove such identified software from such equipment before the
**Closing**   **Date**.

  



  

(iii) At the Closing, Target and Mervyns will execute a nonexclusive,
perpetual, sublicensable, royalty-free license agreement granting Target
Affiliates rights to the software owned by (as opposed to licensed to)
Mervyns, containing terms and conditions substantially as set forth in
_Exhibit J_ hereto.

  



  

(o) _Customer D_ _ata_. To the extent Target or a Target Affiliate own any
rights in any customer data collected at or through Mervyns stores at the
Closing Date, Target or a Target Affiliate, as the case may be, shall assign
all rights in such data to Mervyns, other than customer data of persons who,
as of the Closing Date, have requested that their information not be shared
with non-affiliated third parties via the Target online privacy policy or via
any other channel of communication with Target or a Target Affiliate and
customer data expressly assigned to Portfolio Buyer pursuant to the Portfolio
Purchase Agreement . With respect to all e-mail addresses collected at or
through any Mervyns-specific area of any Web site operated by or on behalf
of Target or any Target Affiliate, Target shall provide Mervyns, on or
before the Closing Date, a copy of all such e-mail addresses, in the
form reasonably requested by Buyer; and Target hereby grants Mervyns a non-
exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable license,
with right to sublicense to use such e-mail addresses in connection with the
conduct of its business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Target or a
Target Affiliate shall provide Mervyns such data (including e-mail
addresses) to the extent the provision of such data would violate any
contractual obligation or violate any applicable law or regulation. In
addition, (i) Mervyns agrees that such customer data shall only be used for
lawful purposes; (ii) its use of such information will be in accordance with
all federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the privacy and
security of such customer data; and (iii) Mervyns agrees it shall honor all
customer opt out request flags transferred with such customer data and
identified to Buyer in connection therewith, including "do not mail, "do not
telephone" and any sublicense shall provide for such restrictions.
Target shall, on or before the Closing Date, notify Buyer in writing of the
terms and conditions under which Target or a Target Affiliate collected any
customer data assigned or licensed to Mervyns hereunder.  Except in the
case of e-mail addresses described above, Mervyns understands and agrees
that Target will not provide any customer data residing in the Target guest
database to Mervyns.

  



  

 **(p)** ** ****_Third-Party Confidentiality Agr_** ** _eements_** **. From
and after the Closing Date, Target shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to enforce the terms of the Third-Party Confidentiality Agreements for the
benefit of Buyer; provided that Buyer shall reimburse Target for all out-of-
pocket expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by Target in undertaking
such enforcement. For purposes of this Section 8(p), "Third-Party
Confidentiality Agreements" means the confidentiality agreements that Target
entered into with prospective purchasers (other than Buyer) of the
business of the Companies.**

  



  

 **(q)** ** ****_Conversion Do_** ** _cuments_** **. After the Closing, Target
shall deliver to Mervyns the certificates of conversion (or such other
documents) it receives from the California and Minnesota Secretaries of State
evidencing the Mervyns Conversion and Brands Conversion, respectively.**

  



  

9. _Employees and Employee Be_ _nefits_.

  



  

(a) _Offers of Employme_ _nt_. Buyer will cause Mervyns to continue the
employment effective immediately after the **Closing**  Date of all hourly
employees and all salaried employees who are employed by Mervyns on the
**Closing** Date, including each such employee on medical, disability,
family, or other leave of absence as of the **Closing**  Date, except
employees located at Minnesota Stores and except those persons identified in
Section 9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule as persons who will be transferred to
a Target Affiliate **. Within ten business days prior to the Closing Date,
Target will provide to Buyer a list showing the names of each such employee
on leave (and such list shall be updated as of the Closing Date))**.  The
continued employment **immediately following the Closing Date** shall in each
case **provide base wages** and **salary and bonus opportunity **(other than
employee benefits, which are subject to Section 9(b)) that are comparable to
the **base wages**  and **salary and bonus opportunity (but excluding any
equity based compensation)**  provided to each such employee on the
**Closing** Date. The employees who continue as employees of Mervyns are
referred to as "Retained Employees." Nothing in this Section 9(a) shall
obligate Buyer or Mervyns to continue the employment of any such Retained
Employee for any specific period **, or to maintain base wages and salary and
bonus opportunity at any particular level,** following the **Closing**
 Date.

  



  

(b) _Buyer_ _ s Employee Benefit Plans Generally_. As of the **Closing Date**
, Buyer shall provide **(through the Transition Services Agreement or
otherwise)** , or shall cause Mervyns to provide, each Retained Employee
with employee benefits that are at least comparable, in the aggregate, to the
Plans (other than the Plans described in Sections 9(j) and (k)) provided to
such Retained Employee by Mervyns immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Buyers Plans"). After the **Closing** **Date** , the following shall
apply:

  



  

(i) Except as otherwise provided in the following subsections of this Section
9, as of the Effective Time, Buyer will assume, or will cause Mervyns or
Buyers Plans to assume, all liabilities and obligations for benefits payable
under each Plan **specifically set forth on Section 9(b)(i) of the
Disclosure Schedule **to or with respect to (A) any current employee employed
by Mervyns immediately prior to the **Closing** **Date** , including any
employee on medical, disability, family, or other leave of absence as of the
**Closing**   **Date** , (B) any former employee of Mervyns who was on the
payroll of Mervyns on the date the individuals most recent termination of
employment from Target and all of the affiliates of Target occurred, and (C)
any dependent or former dependent of any such employee or former employee,
including any dependent or former dependent entitled to COBRA coverage
assumed by Buyer under Section 9(g) hereof (collectively, "Covered Persons").
 Such assumed liabilities include liabilities that relate to
events occurring or expenses incurred at or prior to the Effective Time but
that have not been paid as of the Effective Time, including benefits paid by
Target or a Plan by check or bank draft on or before the Cut-Off Date, which
check or bank draft has not cleared by the Cut-Off **Date**. Any such
benefits related to events occurring or expenses incurred after the Effective
Time shall be determined under the terms of Buyers Plans, except as provided
to the contrary in the following subsections of this Section 9.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall give, or cause Mervyns to give, each Retained Employee
credit under Buyers Plans or personnel policies that cover the Retained
Employee, including any vacation, sick leave and severance policies, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and entitlement to **vacation, sick leave
and severance** benefits ( **excluding**  accrual of benefits under **any**
defined benefit pension **plan** ) for the Retained Employees service with
Target and its affiliates prior to the Effective Time, shall allow such
Retained Employees to participate in each such Buyers Plan **providing
medical benefits** without regard to preexisting-condition limitations,
waiting periods, evidence of insurability, or other exclusions or limitations
not imposed on the Retained Employee by the corresponding Plans immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and shall credit the Retained Employee with any
expenses that were covered by the Plans for purposes of determining
deductibles, co-pays, and other applicable limits under Buyers Plans **. To
the extent any Retained Employee or covered dependent is hospitalized as of
the Closing Date (or the latest date medical coverage is provided to such
employee or dependent under any Target medical plan pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement), such person will continue to be covered under
the medical coverage provided by Target until the date they are released from
the hospital and Mervyn s shall reimburse Target for any expenses associated
with such extended hospital stay that are incurred after the
**Effective Time.

  



  

(iii) No portion of the assets of any trust or other fund maintained by
Target for the purpose of paying benefits under any of the Plans will be
transferred to Buyer, the Companies, or any Buyers Plan.

  



  

(c) _Severance Be_ _nefits_. If any Retained Employee is
involuntarily terminated by Buyer or Mervyns within 12 months following the
Closing Date under circumstances that would have qualified the Retained
Employee for severance benefits under any of the severance plans or practices
listed in Section 4(o) of the Disclosure Schedule, other than the Target
Income Continuance Policy ("Mervyns Severance Practices") if the Retained
Employee had been terminated involuntarily under the same circumstances by
Mervyns at or prior to the **Closing Date** (except that "same
circumstances" shall not be deemed to include any requirement under Mervyns
Severance Practices that the termination have been made in connection with
the consideration of the transaction that is the subject of this Agreement),
Buyer will provide, or cause Mervyns to provide, to the Retained Employee
under Buyers Plans benefits that are at least equal to the severance pay and
other benefits provided under the applicable Mervyns Severance Practices.
Buyer shall assume, or cause Mervyns to assume, the responsibility for all
benefits that are payable under the Target Income Continuance Policy
following the **Closing** **Date**  to (i) any Retained Employee, or (ii) any
former employee who was on the payroll of Mervyns at the time the persons
employment with Mervyns terminated; provided that, as a condition to any
such persons receipt of benefits under the Target Income Continuance Policy,
Buyer shall require the person to execute an instrument releasing all claims
the person may have against Buyer, Target, or Mervyns.

  



  

(d) _Vacation Pay and Per_ _sonal Holidays_. Buyer shall cause Mervyns to
continue to credit to each Retained Employee all vacation and personal
holiday pay that the Retained Employee is entitled to use but has not used as
of the Effective Time (including any earned vacation or personal holiday pay
to be used in future years), and shall assume all liability for the payment
of such amounts pursuant to the Target vacation and personal holiday pay
policies listed in Section 4(o) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(e) _Disability Benefits_ _and Leaves_. Buyer will, or will cause Mervyns
to, assume all liabilities payable under the Mervyns Disability Plus
program, whether related to a disability that occurred before or after the
Effective Time . Except as provided in the previous sentence, (i) **Target
and** the Plans shall retain the liability for all long-term disability
benefits payable to any Covered Person under the terms of Targets long-term
disability plans after the Effective Time with respect to any disability that
occurred prior to the Effective Time (but not with respect to any
reoccurrence of such a disability after the Effective Time ), (ii) Buyer,
Mervyns, or a Buyers Plan shall assume the liability for all short-term
disability benefits payable to any Retained Employee under Targets short-
term disability plans that are payable following the Effective Time
with respect to any disability that occurred prior to the Effective Time
(determined under the terms of the Plan or personnel policy that applies to
the disabled Retained Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time )
until the date, if any, on which the Retained Employee qualifies for benefits
under the Target long-term disability plans, and (iii) Buyers Plans will
govern the determination of what, if any, short-term and long-term disability
benefits will be paid to any Retained Employee whose disability occurs after
the Effective Time (or which reoccurs after the Effective Time ). If any
Retained Employee is on any form of leave of absence on the **Closing** Date
(including any leave subject to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 or
comparable state law), Buyer shall reinstate, or shall cause Mervyns to
reinstate, such Retained Employee to active employment upon the expiration of
the leave to the extent such reinstatement is required by any applicable law
or regulation or by **Mervyn** s personnel policies and shall satisfy any
other obligation **with respect** to such Retained Employee **as
required under any applicable law or regulation or the Mervyn s personnel
policies (copies of which have been provided to Buyer) **upon the expiration
of **such** leave.

  



  

(f) _Medical and Dental Plan Liab_ _ilities_. Buyer shall, or shall cause
Mervyns or the applicable Buyers Plan to, assume and pay any benefits or
expenses covered by the group medical and dental plans included within the
Plans that were incurred with respect to services performed for Covered
Persons prior to the Effective Time but have not been paid by the Plans prior
to the Effective Time , including benefits paid by Target or a Plan by check
or bank draft on or before the Cut-Off Date, which check or bank draft has
not cleared by the Cut-Off Date. If Buyer provides such Buyers Plans to a
Retained Employee following Effective Time , Buyer shall pay or shall cause
the applicable Buyers Plan to pay any such benefits or expenses that are
incurred with respect to services performed for the Retained Employee or the
Retained Employees dependents after the Effective Time .

  



  

(g) _COBR_ _A Coverage_.   **Effective as of the** Effective Time **,**
Buyer shall **provide (through the Transition Services Agreement or
otherwise)** , or shall cause Mervyns to, assume and satisfy (or cause a
Buyers Plan to satisfy) all entitlements under Code Section 4980B, Part 6 or
7 of Title I of ERISA, or any similar state law (collectively, "COBRA") with
respect to any Plan subject to COBRA of any employee or former employee of
Mervyns, or any dependent or former dependent of any such employee or former
employee of Mervyns, whose qualifying event occurred prior to the Effective
Time at a time when the employee or former employee was on the payroll of
Mervyns (or whose qualifying event occurs at the Effective Time as a result
of the transactions covered by this Agreement), including any obligations to
individuals currently on such COBRA continuation coverage and any obligations
to any individual whose period for electing such COBRA continuation coverage
has not yet expired.

  



  

(h) _Retiree Medica_ _l Obligations_. **Target shall retain** ,
**indemnify and hold harmless** Buyer **and** Mervyns **from**  all
liabilities and obligations **applicable to Retained Employees and current
and former employees of Mervyn s **( **including any** dependents or
**beneficiaries thereof) for** retiree medical **or life insurance** benefits
under any of **the Plans set forth in Section 4(o) of the Disclosure
Schedule ("Target Medical Plans") to which such individual is entitled prior
to or as of the Cut-Off Date**. ** Buyer and Mervyns will not offer
retiree medical or life insurance benefits to any current or former employees
of Mervyns (including any dependent or beneficiary thereof).**

  



  

(i) _Flexible Spendin_ _g Accounts_. Buyer will, or will cause Mervyns
to, credit each Retained Employee (and any former employee of Mervyns or
dependent or former dependent of an employee or former employee who has COBRA
rights described in Section 9(g) with respect to flexible spending
accounts) under a health care and dependent care flexible spending account
plan or plans maintained by Buyer or Mervyns ("Buyers Flex Plans") with a
balance (positive or negative) as of the Effective Time equal to the balance
credited to the individual under the applicable health care and dependent
care flexible spending account plans of Target listed in Section 4(o) of the
Disclosure Schedule ("Target Flex Plans") as of the Effective Time
**("Aggregate Flex Plan Balances")** , and will reimburse each
such individual for expenses incurred during the current plan year of such
Target Flex Plan (whether incurred before or after the Effective Time) that
had not been reimbursed under such Target Flex Plan prior to the Effective
Time **(to the same extent such eligible expense would have been reimbursable
under such Target Flex Plan)**. **As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date, Target shall transfer Net Assets to Buyer s Flex Plan
equal to the Aggregate Flex Plan Balances and **Buyer, Mervyns, and Target
will treat the arrangement described in this Section 9(i) as a spin-off of
the applicable portions of the Target Flex Plans and a merger of such
portions into Buyers Flex Plans.

  



  

(j) _Qualified Retiremen_ _t and 401(k) Plans_. Buyer and Mervyns will have
no liability for benefits payable under the Target Corporation 401(k) Plan,
the Target Corporation Pension Plan, the Mervyns Pension Plan, or The
Retirement Plan of the J. L. Hudson Company (collectively, "Target Retirement
Plans"). **Prior to the Closing Date, Target will assume sponsorship of and
all liabilities relating to the Mervyn s Pension Plan. Target shall take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary to fully vest Retained Employees
under all Target Retirement Plans and all other Plans that are deferred
compensation or supplemental retirement plans. **Buyer either currently
maintains, or will establish or cause Mervyns to establish, not later than
**90**  days after the **Closing** Date, one or more qualified
defined contribution plans ("Buyers DC Plan") that will contain all
provisions necessary for the acceptance of direct rollovers **(in the form
of cash and notes relating to plan participant loans)** of "eligible rollover
distributions" as defined in the Code and applicable regulations that
Retained Employees are eligible to receive from the Target Retirement Plans
without adversely affecting the qualified status of any Target Retirement
Plan. Buyers DC Plan will contain provisions to permit any such direct
rollover to include the promissory note or notes representing any Plan loans
outstanding to the Retained Employee under the Target Corporation 401(k) Plan
on the date of the direct rollover, and Buyer **,**  Mervyns **and Target**
 will cooperate with **each other** to enable such direct rollovers to
occur before such loans become defaulted. ** Target agrees not to place any
such loans in default for at least 90 days following the Closing Date.**

  



  

(k) _Other Retain_ _ed Plans_. Target will retain **any and** all liabilities
and obligations with respect to benefits payable to or with respect to any
individual under the Plans listed in Section 9(k) of the Disclosure Schedule.

  



  

(l) _Retiree Merchandis_ _e Discount Programs_. Following the
**Closing Date** , Buyer **shall or shall  **cause Mervyns to **provide
under a** Mervyns **retiree discount program (which shall be generally
similar to**  Targets retiree discount **program) retiree discounts** (only
with respect to merchandise purchased at Mervyns stores) to each retiree, or
spouse or dependent of a retiree, who retired from Mervyns and who is
eligible for such programs under Targets **retiree discount program**
eligibility guidelines.

  



  

 **(m)** ** ****_Workers_** ** _ Compensation Liabilities_** **. As of the
Effective Time, Buyer will cause the Companies to assume (or reimburse Target
and the other Target Affiliates for) all liabilities and obligations relating
to compensation and benefits under any state workers compensation or similar
law payable following the Effective Time to or with respect to any Retained
Employee, or to any former employee of either Company, who in either case was
employed by either Company on the date the claim arose or the incident on
which the claim is based occurred.**

  



  

 **(n)** _No Third_ _-Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality
of Section 13, none of the preceding subsections of this Section 9
shall confer any rights or remedies upon any employee or former employee of
Target, Mervyns, or Buyer, or upon any other person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

10. _Tax Matter_ _s_.

  



  

## ** _(a)_** _Tax Payments_ _and Returns_. **Target shall include the
income of the Companies (including any deferred items triggered into income
by Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken
into income under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19) on Targets
consolidated federal Income Tax Returns for all periods through the Cut-Off
Date. **The Companies, on or before the Cut-Off Date, or Target at any time,
shall pay or cause to be paid all Target Taxes, and shall file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns with respect to all Target Taxes other than Target
Taxes for a Straddle Period.  Except as provided in Section 10(b), in the
case of Taxes other than Income Taxes **,** the Companies shall (i) pay or
cause to be paid on or before the **Cut-Off** Date any such Taxes that the
Companies would pay on or before the **Cut-Off** Date in the ordinary course
of business, consistent with past practices and (ii) file or cause to be
filed on or before the **Cut-Off** Date all Tax Returns then due with respect
to such Taxes. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Companies after the **Cut-
Off** Date to, pay all Taxes other than Target Taxes and Taxes to be paid by
the Companies on or before the **Cut-Off** Date as described in the preceding
sentence and shall file all Tax Returns not required to be filed by the
Companies on or before the **Cut-Off** Date or by Target pursuant to this
Agreement. All Tax Returns described in this Section 10(a) **for Tax
periods beginning before the Closing Date** shall be prepared in accordance
with past practice (unless a contrary position is required by law).

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(b)_** _Transfe_ _r Taxes_. Buyer shall pay all sales, use, value-
added, business, goods and services, transfer, documentary, conveyancing or
similar Taxes or expenses and all recording fees that may be imposed as a
result of **(i) the conversion of the Companies into limited liability
companies as contemplated by Section 3(a)(xi), and (ii) **the sale and
transfer of the **Securities** under this Agreement, including any stamp,
duty, or other Tax chargeable in respect of any instrument transferring
property, together with any fines, penalties, interest, and additions to Tax
with respect thereto ("Transfer Taxes"). Target, Buyer, and the Companies
shall cooperate in timely making all filings, returns, reports, and forms as
may be required to comply with the provisions of such Tax laws.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(c)_** _Refunds and C_ _arrybacks_.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(i)_** Target shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of or
against any Target Taxes, and any other Taxes to the extent the Taxes
were paid by a Target Affiliate at any time, were paid by a Company on or
before the Cut-Off Date, or were accrued on the Statement, except to the
extent the refund or credit is shown as an asset on the Statement (in each
case plus any interest received with respect thereto), and Buyer shall
**, at Target s expense,** cause the Companies to file, or cause to be
filed, any claims for such refunds or credits reasonably requested by Target.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(ii)_** Except to the extent set forth in Section 10(c)(i), the
Companies shall be entitled to any refunds or credits of Taxes
attributable to the Companies (plus any interest received with respect
thereto).

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(iii)_** Buyer or the Companies shall promptly forward to Target or
reimburse Target for any refund or credits due Target (pursuant to the terms
of this Section 10(c)) after receipt **or use** thereof, and Target shall
promptly forward to the Companies or reimburse the Companies for any refunds
or credits due the Companies (pursuant to the terms of this Section 10(c))
after receipt **or use** thereof.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(iv)_** Refunds or credits of Income Taxes for a Straddle Period
shall be allocated in the manner in which Income Taxes are allocated
in Section **10** (g)( **iii** ).

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(v)_** Neither Buyer, the Companies, nor any of their
affiliates shall elect to carry back any item of loss, deduction, or credit
of Buyer, a Company, or any of their affiliates that arises in any Tax period
or portion thereof ending after the Cut-Off Date into any Tax period or
portion thereof of Target, either of the Companies, or any of their
affiliates ending on or before the Cut-Off Date.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(d)_** _Cooperat_ _ion_. Each of Target, Buyer, and the Companies
shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective affiliates,
officers, employees, agents, auditors, and other representatives to
reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns relating to
Taxes of the Companies, including maintaining and making available to each
other all records necessary in connection with such Taxes and in resolving
all disputes and audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to such
Taxes. Each of Buyer and Target recognizes that the other party and its
affiliates will need access from time to time after the **Closing** Date to
certain accounting and Tax records and information held by such party and its
affiliates to the extent such records and information pertain to events
occurring on or before the **Closing** Date.  Therefore, each of Buyer and
Target shall, and Buyer shall cause each of the Companies to:

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(i)_** properly retain and maintain such records and information as
provided in Section 8(b)(ii), or if longer, in accordance with the past
custom and practice of such corporation until such time as the other party
agrees that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld; and

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(ii)_** allow the other party, its affiliates and their agents and
representatives, at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to
inspect, review and make copies of such records and information as such other
party in good faith may deem necessary or appropriate from time to time, such
activities to be conducted during normal business hours and at the other
partys expense; provided however, that the party to whom the request is made
shall have the right to excise any information that is not reasonably related
to the request.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(e)_** _Termination of T_ _ax-Sharing Agreement_. Target shall
cause any Tax-sharing agreement relating to Taxes (other than real estate
Taxes and assessments) to which a Company is a party to be terminated as to
such Company at or before the **Closing** **Date**.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(_** **f)** ** ****_Purchase Price_** ** _Allocation_**. Within 150
days after the Closing Date, **Buyer** shall deliver to **Target** an
allocation of the **Purchase** Price ( **and all other amounts comprising the
"seller s consideration" **as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section **1.1060-1(c)(1)** ) among the assets of the Companies
(the " **Price ** Allocation"), **which** allocation shall be binding on the
parties **; provided, however, that no less than an aggregate of $75,000,000
will be allocated among the assets of Brands.  Notwithstanding the previous
sentence, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Target the Price Allocation with respect to the Owned Real Estate no later
than 20 days prior to the Closing Date; and Target shall use reasonable
commercial efforts in assisting Buyer in determining such portion of the
Price Allocation within such time frame**. Target and Buyer agree to act in
accordance with the Price Allocation in the preparation and filing of any Tax
Return, and shall not voluntarily take any action inconsistent therewith upon
examination of any Tax Return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or
otherwise with respect to such Tax Returns ** without the consent of the
other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.**

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(g)_** _Tax Indemnifica_ _tion_.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(i)_** Target shall indemnify Buyer and its affiliates (including the
Companies) against (A) all liability of the Companies for Target Taxes **;
(B) all Income Taxes of any member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined
or unitary group of which any of the Companies is or was a member on or prior
to the Closing Date** , including **pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-6 or any similar state, local, or foreign law or regulation; (C) any
and all** Income Taxes **of any person (** other than the **Companies** )
**imposed on any of the Companies as a transferee** or **successor** , **by
contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Income Taxes
relate to an event or transaction**  occurring on or **before** the Closing
Date; ( **D** ) all liability for breaches of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 4(g) **(but in the case of the
representations and warranties in Section 4(g)(ii), only** to ** the extent
that they relate to Income** Taxes **) or the covenant in Section 5(h)**;
and ( **E** ) all liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses
attributable to any item in clauses (A) and ( **D** ) above.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Target shall not indemnify Buyer or Buyers affiliates
(including the Companies) against any liability for Taxes attributable to a
breach by Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(ii)_** Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, indemnify
Target and its affiliates against (A) all liability of the Companies for
Taxes other than **Taxes indemnified by** Target **pursuant to Section
10(g)(i) and** except to the extent required to be paid by the
Companies pursuant to the **third** sentence of Section 10(a); ( **B** ) all
liability for Taxes attributable to a breach by Buyer of its obligations
under this Agreement; and ( **C** ) all liability for reasonable legal fees
and expenses attributable to any item in clauses (A) through ( **B** ) above.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(iii)_** In the case of any Straddle Period, the portion of the
Income Taxes attributable to the Companies for any Pre-Cut-Off Tax
Period (which are subject to indemnification by Target as Target Taxes to the
extent set forth in Section 10(g)(i)) shall be computed by using a closing-
of-the-books method as if such taxable period ended on the Cut-Off Date.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(iv)_** Targets indemnity obligation in respect of unpaid Target
Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be effected by its payment to Buyer of such
unpaid Target Taxes within **10** days after the Tax Return with respect to
the liability for such Taxes is required to be filed (or, if later, is
actually filed). The payment to be made pursuant to this paragraph by Target
with respect to any Straddle Period shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect any final determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code with respect to Income Taxes for such Straddle Period.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(h)_** _Procedures Relating to Indem_ _nification of Tax Claims_.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(i)_** If a claim is made by any Taxing Authority that,
if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to Buyer or Target under
Section 10(g), the indemnified party shall **within 10 days of receipt of
such claim** notify the indemnifying party in writing of the claim (a "Tax
Claim"). If notice of a Tax Claim received by the indemnified party after the
**Closing** Date is not given to the indemnifying party within **such** period
of time, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party
to the extent that the indemnifying partys position is actually prejudiced
as a result thereof.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(ii)_** The indemnifying party shall control, at its sole expense,
all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim (except to the extent
the Tax Claim relates to Income Taxes of the Companies for a Straddle Period)
and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or
forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings,
and conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto and either pay
the Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund
suits or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner **; provided,
however, that the indemnifying party shall not settle any such audit in a
manner that would adversely affect the indemnified party without the
prior written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Target shall
control, in its sole discretion and at its sole expense, all proceedings
relating to Income Tax Returns that include one or more of the Companies for
periods ending on or before the Cut-Off Date. The indemnified party and the
indemnifying party shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection
with any Tax Claim to the extent it relates to Income Taxes of one or more of
the Companies for a Straddle Period. Each of the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and their respective affiliates shall cooperate in
contesting any Tax Claim (with reimbursement by the indemnifying party of
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (but not compensation payments to
employees) of any indemnified party incurred in connection therewith), which
cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to the Tax Claim, and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to testify
at proceedings relating to the Tax Claim.

  

## ** _ _**

  

## ** _(iii)_** In no case shall the indemnified party or the indemnifying
party or their respective affiliates admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise, or discharge, any Tax Claim without prior written consent
of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that
Target may admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise, or
discharge any Tax Claim relating to **Income ** Taxes of the Companies for a
Pre **-Cut-Off ** Tax Period (other than, with respect to Income Taxes, for
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Cut-Off Date) without the
consent of Buyer.

11. _Indemnific_ _ation_.

  



  

(a) _Indemnification by Target_. Target shall indemnify Buyer and
its affiliates **, officers, directors, employees, equityholders, agents,
successors, assigns and affiliates**  against any loss, liability, claim,
damage, or out-of-pocket expense (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses), except as otherwise provided in Sections 11(c), 11(d), and 11(e),
suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to the extent caused
proximately by:

  



  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Target contained in this
Agreement (other than any representations or warranties contained in Section
4(g), all of which are the subject of Section 10) or in the certificates
delivered by Target pursuant Section 3(a)(iii) **and 3(a)(xii)** ,

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Target contained in this Agreement,
including the covenants of Target contained in Section 9,

  



  

(iii) any liability or obligation relating to the operation or ownership of
the Minnesota Stores, or

  



  

(iv) any liability or obligation relating to stores or distribution centers
formerly owned or operated by Mervyns that have been closed or sold prior to
the date of the Interim Statement of Net Assets (other than the Hialeah,
Florida store),

  



  

provided, however, that:

  



  

(A) Target shall not have any liability under clause (i) above (except for
breaches of **the first and second sentence of** Section 4( **a)
and Sections 4(** b), 4(c), **4(g),** 4(o) **, 4(u) or 22** ) unless the
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense under clause (i) for which Target
would, but for this clause (A), be liable (1) exceeds $50,000 on an
individual basis and (2) the aggregate of all such losses, liabilities,
claims, damages, and expenses that individually exceed $50,000 exceeds, on a
cumulative basis, an amount equal to 2% of the Adjusted Purchase Price, and
then only to the extent of any such excess,

  



  

(B) Target shall not have any liability under clause (i) above (except for
breaches of **the first and second sentence of** Section 4( **a)
and Sections 4(** b), 4(c), **4(g),** 4(o) **, 4(u) or 22** ) to the extent
the aggregate of all losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses under
clause (i) for which Target would, but for the provisions of this clause (B),
be liable exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to 5% of the
Adjusted Purchase Price, and

  



  

(C) Target shall not have any liability under this Section 11(a) for any
loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense to the extent **(and in the same
amount)** such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense has been included
in the final determination of Final Net Assets.

  



  

(v) Except in the case of claims in respect of Taxes, which are the subject
of Section 10, **and in the case of intentional fraud,** Buyers sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement (including claims for breaches of
representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements contained in this
Agreement) shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Section 11(a). In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer hereby waives, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights,
claims, and causes of action of Buyer against Target as a matter of equity or
under or based upon any federal, state, provincial, local or foreign statute,
law, ordinance, rule, or regulation (including those relating to
Environmental Laws) or arising under or based upon common law or otherwise,
except to the extent provided with respect to Target in this Section 11(a) or
in Section 10 with respect to Taxes.

  



  

 **(vi)** ** ****Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, for purposes of
this Section 11 only in determining losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses pursuant to this Section 11, each representation and warranty shall
be read without regard for, and without giving effect to, the terms
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect," or other terms of similar impact or
effect contained in such representation or warranty (i.e., as if such word
were deleted from such representation and warranty).**

  



  

(b) _Indemnification by B_ _uyer_. Buyer shall indemnify the Target
Affiliates against any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses), except as otherwise provided in Section
11(c), 11(d), or 11(e)) suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party to
the extent caused proximately by:

  



  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer contained in this
Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant Section 3(b)(i);

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant of Buyer contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement, including the covenants of Buyer contained in
Section 9;

  



  

(iii) any guarantee or obligation to ensure performance given or made by any
Target Affiliate with respect to any obligation of either Company, including
with respect to letters of credit, without any right of set off or
contribution against any Target Affiliate;

  



  

(iv) any claim with respect to products sold by Mervyns, whether before or
after the **Closing Date** ;

  



  

(v) any liability or obligation under or in respect of any contract or
agreement assigned to Mervyns pursuant to Section 8(i); or

  



  

(vi) any liability or obligation to the extent solely related to the
operation of the Companies businesses or the ownership of their assets
before or after the **Closing Date** (other than those items for which Buyer
is entitled to indemnification from Target under Section 11(a)), including
with respect to, or in settlement of, any action, lawsuit, hearing,
arbitration, proceeding, or governmental investigation, whether arising
before or after the **Closing**   **Date** , or with respect to, or in
settlement of, any claims by current or former employees of Mervyns for acts
or omissions occurring before or after the **Closing**   **Date**  (except
to the extent that Target retains liability for certain employee benefits
under Section 9(e), (j), or (k)).

  



  

(c) _Adjustments_ _; Remedial Actions_.

  



  

(i) The amount of any loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense for which
indemnification is provided under Section 10 or this Section 11 shall be net
of any amounts **(net of any collection costs, fees and expenses of the
indemnified party and any premium increases, premiums retroactively assessed
that directly result from the payment by the insurer of the claim, co-
payments and the like applicable to the indemnified party) actually**
recovered (regardless of time) by the indemnified party under insurance
policies (including the title insurance policy issued under the Title
Commitments, which policies Buyer agrees to obtain promptly following the
Closing) with respect to such loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense
**(and such indemnified party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to recover such amounts under such insurance policies)** , and shall be (A)
increased to take account of any net Tax cost **actually** incurred by the
indemnified party arising from the receipt of indemnity payments hereunder
(grossed up for such increase) **, but excluding additional Income Tax
incurred by Target as a result of realizing additional gain on the
transactions completed hereunder,** and (B) reduced to take account of any
net Tax benefit **actually** realized by the indemnified party arising from
the incurrence or payment of any such loss, liability, claim, damage, or
expense.  In computing the amount of any such Tax cost or Tax benefit,
the indemnified party shall be deemed to use all other items of income, gain,
loss, deduction, or credit before using any item arising from the incurrence
or payment of any indemnified loss, liability, claim, damage, or expense or
of any indemnity payment pursuant to Section 10 or this Section 11. Any
indemnity payment made pursuant to Section 10 or this Section 11 will be
treated as an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price for Tax purposes,
unless a final determination (which shall include the execution of a Form
870-AD or successor form) with respect to the indemnified party causes any
such payment not to constitute an adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price
for federal Income Tax purposes.

  



  

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated herein, if remedial
action is required to correct a situation giving rise to any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense for which a party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10 or this Section 11, then the indemnifying party shall
in no event be obligated with respect to the costs and expenses of such
remedial action (A) in the case of any contamination or other condition at
the Real Estate the existence of which constitutes a breach of any
representation or warranty of Target set forth in Section 4(r), to the extent
such costs and expenses exceed those that would have been incurred had Buyer
taken only such actions to remediate such contamination or other condition as
are required under applicable law, and (B) in all other cases, to the extent
such costs and expenses exceed those that would have been incurred had the
indemnified party taken only such actions to correct such situation that a
person of ordinary prudence under like circumstances who was not entitled
to indemnification for the costs and expenses of such remedial action would
have reasonably taken.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Inde_ _mnification_. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless a party hereto, (i) pursuant to Sections 11(a)(i)
and 11(b)(i), shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to Section 15, and (ii) pursuant to Section 10
or the other clauses of Sections 11(a) and 11(b), shall not terminate until
**30 days after** the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
provided, however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall
not terminate with respect to any item as to which the person to be
indemnified shall have, before the expiration of the applicable
period, previously made a claim by delivering a notice to the party to be
providing the indemnification.

  



  

(e) _Procedures Relat_ _ing to Indemnification_.

  



  

(i) In order for a party (the "indemnified party") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of, or involving a claim or demand made by any third party against the
indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such indemnified party shall
notify the other party (the "indemnifying party") in writing of the Third-
Party Claim, and deliver to the indemnifying party copies of all notices and
documents accompanying or constituting the Third-Party Claim, within ten
business days after obtaining notice thereof; provided, however, that failure
to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder, except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure and except that the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any expenses incurred during
the period in which the indemnified party failed to give such notice.
Thereafter, the indemnified party shall deliver to the indemnifying party,
within five business days after the indemnified partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim; provided, however that
failure to deliver such copies shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

  



  

(ii) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by
the indemnifying party and reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party
**, provided that (A) counsel for the indemnifying party shall not have given
the indemnifying party written notice that such counsel has determined, in
the exercise of its reasonable discretion, that a conflict of** interest
**makes separate representation by the indemnified party s own counsel
advisable and (B) such Third-Party Claim does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief, involve criminal or quasi-criminal allegations or
involve a claim that is reasonably likely to have an adverse determination
that would be detrimental to or injure the indemnified partys or any of its
affiliates reputation or future business prospects**. Should the
indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
which election must be made within ten business days (in the case of a Third-
Party Claim with respect to which a complaint has been filed) or 30 days (in
the case of all other Third-Party Claims) after the indemnifying party
receives notice of the Third-Party Claim from the indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the indemnified
party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being understood that the
indemnifying party shall control such defense. If the indemnifying party has
not assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim within the applicable time
period set forth herein, the indemnifying party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party. If
**, after meeting the requirements set forth herein,** the
indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third-Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof with
reimbursement by the indemnifying party of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of the indemnified party incurred in connection therewith. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying partys request) the
provision to the indemnifying party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. **If** the indemnifying party
**has**  assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party
shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. ** If
the indemnifying party has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim
and subsequently fails to vigorously defend or prosecute such Third-Party
Claim, the indemnified party shall be entitled to assume the defense of
such Third-Party Claim (without any limitation on its ability to admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third-
Party Claim) at the expense of the indemnifying party.**

  



  

(f) _Tax Indem_ _nification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 11, indemnification of Buyer or Target with respect to Tax matters
shall be governed by Section 10, except to the extent specific reference is
made to Section 10 in this Section 11.

  



  

12. _Assign_ _ment_. This Agreement and the rights hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer or Target without the prior written consent of the other party hereto, which consent may be withheld in a partys sole discretion **, provided that Buyer may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to its lenders for collateral security purposes, to any of its affiliates and to any purchaser or purchasers of all or substantially all of assets, provided that no such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any obligations or liabilities under this Agreement**.

  



  

13. _No Thi_ _rd-Party Beneficiaries_.  Except as expressly provided in Sections 10(g) and 11 with respect to affiliates of Target and Buyer, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns, and nothing herein expressed or implied shall give or be construed to give to any person, other than the parties and such successors and assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

  



  

14. _Terminat_ _ion_.

  



  

(a) Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement
may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any
time before the Closing:

  



  

(i) by mutual written consent of Target and Buyer;

  



  

(ii) by Target upon five business days notice if any of the conditions set
forth in Section 3(b) shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the
Closing, and shall not have been waived in writing by Target;

  



  

(iii) by Buyer upon five business days notice if any of the conditions set
forth in Section 3(a) shall have become incapable of fulfillment at the
Closing, and shall not have been waived in writing by Buyer; or

  



  

(iv) by Target or Buyer, if the Closing does not occur on or before November
15 **, 2004** ;

  



  

provided, however, that the failure to satisfy the conditions or consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement did not result from the
breach in any material respect by the party seeking termination pursuant
to clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) In the event of termination by Target or Buyer pursuant to this Section
14, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other party and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be terminated, without
further action by any party. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are terminated as provided herein:

  



  

(i) Buyer shall return to Target all documents and other material received
from or on behalf of Target relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof; and

  



  

(ii) all confidential information received by Buyer shall be treated in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with the terms thereof notwithstanding the
termination of this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(c) If this Agreement is terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby
are abandoned as described in this Section 14, this Agreement shall become
void and of no further force and effect, except for the provisions of (i)
