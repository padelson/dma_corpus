between MBNA CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (&#147;<U>MBNA</U>&#148;), and BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Bank of America</U>&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of MBNA and Bank of America have determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective companies and their stockholders to consummate the strategic
business combination transaction provided for in this Agreement in which MBNA will, on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into Bank of America (the
&#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;), so that Bank of America is the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the &#147;<U>Surviving Corporation</U>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;<U>Code</U>&#148;), and this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a &#147;plan of
reorganization&#148; for purposes of Sections&nbsp;354 and 361 of the Code;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as an inducement and condition to the entrance of Bank of America into this
Agreement, MBNA is granting to Bank of America an option pursuant to a stock option agreement in
the form set forth in Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;<U>Stock Option Agreement</U>&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and agreements in
connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and
agreements contained in this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
agree as follows:

Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Bank of America. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share,
Bank of America shall pay to each former stockholder of MBNA who otherwise would be entitled to
receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i)&nbsp;the Bank of America Closing Price by (ii)&nbsp;the fraction of a share (after taking
into account all shares of MBNA Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded

look only to Bank of America with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any
fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Bank of America Common Stock

direct control of MBNA or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all
means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct
control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of
internal accounting controls described below in this Section&nbsp;3.6(c). MBNA (x)&nbsp;has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to
ensure that material information relating to MBNA, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made
known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of MBNA by others within those
entities, and (y)&nbsp;has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
MBNA&#146;s outside auditors and the audit committee of MBNA&#146;s Board of Directors (i)&nbsp;any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect MBNA&#146;s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii)&nbsp;any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in MBNA&#146;s internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made
in writing by management to MBNA&#146;s auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Bank of America. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that its
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted
pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or

connection with this Stock Option Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;); and

forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the &#147;Option&#148;) to
purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 249,764,005 fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Issuer&#146;s Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (&#147;Common Stock&#148;), at a price of $21.30 per share
(the &#147;Option Price&#148;); <u>provided, however</u>, that in no event shall the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuer&#146;s issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the
Option. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the Option
and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i)&nbsp;issued or otherwise
become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii)
redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this
Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or
decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of
shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or
issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger
Agreement.

time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a
Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of
an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), <U>provided</U> that the Holder shall have

the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form
S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a
vote of the stockholders of MBNA I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of MBNA and the
distribution by me of Bank of America Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Bank of America Common Stock issued to me in the Merger
unless (i)&nbsp;such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)&nbsp;such
sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of
Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii)&nbsp;in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to Bank of America, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;I understand that Bank of America is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or
other disposition of Bank of America Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take
any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration
available.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Bank of America&#146;s
transfer agents with respect to Bank of America Common Stock and that there will be placed on the
certificates for Bank of America Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in
a transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated under the Securities Act
of 1933 applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in
compliance with the requirements of Rule&nbsp;145 or pursuant to a
registration statement under said act or an exemption from such
registration.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Bank of America Common Stock has
been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145, Bank
of America reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my
transferee:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who
received such shares in a transaction to which Rule&nbsp;145 promulgated
under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been
acquired by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Bank of America&#146;s
transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will
cease to apply, if (A)&nbsp;one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule&nbsp;145(d)(2) under
the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the
provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B)&nbsp;if two years (or such other period as may
be required by Rule&nbsp;145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed
from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C)&nbsp;I shall
have delivered to Bank of America (i)&nbsp;a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America, or other
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America, to the effect that such legend and/or stop
transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii)&nbsp;reasonably
satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are
being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145
under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i)&nbsp;my spouse, (ii)&nbsp;any
relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii)&nbsp;any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or
any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as
