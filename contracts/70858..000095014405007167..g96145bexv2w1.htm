 (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates, accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a holder of MBNA Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (with the aggregate Cash Consideration paid to each such holder rounded to the nearest whole cent) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Bank of America Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in respect of the shares of MBNA Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Bank of America Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.   

 (c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Bank of America Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Bank of America Common Stock represented thereby, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Bank of America Common Stock represented by such Certificate and not paid and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of Bank of America Common Stock represented by such Certificate with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Bank of America Common Stock issuable with respect to such Certificate.   

 (d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing MBNA Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer records of MBNA, the proper amount of cash and/or shares of Bank of America Common Stock shall be paid or issued in exchange    ##### 

  

    

therefor to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate formerly representing such MBNA
Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment or issuance shall pay any
transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment or issuance
to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or establish
to the satisfaction of Bank of America that the Tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the first anniversary of
the Effective Time, Bank of America) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Bank of America Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of MBNA Common Stock such amounts as the
Exchange Agent or Bank of America, as the case may be, is required to deduct
and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts
are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Bank of America, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of MBNA Common Stock in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Bank of
America, as the case may be.   

 (e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of MBNA of the shares of MBNA Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of MBNA Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Bank of America Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Bank of America Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Bank of America Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Bank of America. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Bank of America shall pay to each former stockholder of MBNA who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Bank of America Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of MBNA Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Bank of America Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4.   

 (g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of MBNA as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time may be paid to Bank of America. In such event, any former stockholders of MBNA who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Bank of America with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Bank of America Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of MBNA Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in    ##### 

  

    

each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of Bank of America, MBNA, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of shares of MBNA Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.   

 (h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Bank of America or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Bank of America may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 (a) MBNA and each of its Subsidiaries have timely filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that they were required to file since January 1, 2002 with (i) the Federal Reserve Board, (ii) the FDIC, (iii) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, (iv) any state insurance commission or other state regulatory authority, (v) the SEC, (vi) the FSA, the OSFI and any other foreign regulatory authority and (vii) any SRO (collectively, " _Regulatory Agencies_ ") and with each other applicable Governmental Entity, and all other reports and statements required to be filed by them since January 1, 2002, including any report or statement required to be filed pursuant to the laws, rules or regulations of the United States, any state, any foreign entity, or any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity, and have paid all fees and assessments due and payable in connection therewith. Except for normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of the business of MBNA and its Subsidiaries, no Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has initiated since January 1, 2002 or has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of MBNA, investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2002, no Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity has resolved any proceeding, enforcement action or, to the knowledge of MBNA, investigation into the business, disclosures or operations of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries. There is no unresolved violation, criticism, comment or exception by any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations or inspections of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2002, there has been no formal or informal inquiries by, or disagreements or disputes with, any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity with respect to the business, operations, policies or procedures of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries (other than normal examinations conducted by a Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity in MBNAs ordinary course of business).   

 (b) Neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has been ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, or has been since January 1, 2002 a recipient of any supervisory letter from, or since January 1, 2002 has adopted any policies, procedures or board resolutions at    ##### 

  

    

the request or suggestion of, any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental
Entity that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its
business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its
ability to pay dividends, its credit, risk management or compliance policies,
its internal controls, its management or its business (or, as applicable, its
operations as a financial subsidiary of a national bank under the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act of 1999), other than those of general application that apply
to similarly situated bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries (each item
in this sentence, a " _MBNA Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has MBNA or any of
its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2002 by any Regulatory Agency
or other Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering, or requesting any such MBNA Regulatory Agreement. To the knowledge
of MBNA there has not been any event or occurrence since January 1, 2002 that
would result in a determination that either MBNA America Bank, N.A. or MBNA
America (Delaware), N.A. is not "well capitalized" and "well managed" as a
matter of U.S. federal banking law.   

 (c) MBNA has previously made available to Bank of America an accurate and complete copy of each (i) final registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule and definitive proxy statement filed with or furnished to the SEC by MBNA since January 1, 2002 pursuant to the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _MBNA SEC Reports_ ") and (ii) communication mailed by MBNA to its stockholders since January 1, 2002 and prior to the date of this Agreement. No such MBNA SEC Report or communication, at the time filed, furnished or communicated (and, in the case of registration statements and proxy statements, on the dates of effectiveness and the dates of the relevant meetings, respectively), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except that information as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) shall be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date. As of their respective dates, all MBNA SEC Reports complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto. No executive officer of MBNA has failed in any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ").   

 3.6 _Financial Statements_.

The books and records of MBNA and its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any    ##### 

  

    

other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect only actual
transactions. Ernst and Young LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of MBNA as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with MBNA on a matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or
procedure.   

 (b) Neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to become due), except for those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of MBNA included in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2005 (including any notes thereto) and for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since March 31, 2005 or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.   

 (c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of MBNA and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of MBNA or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described below in this Section 3.6(c). MBNA (x) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to MBNA, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of MBNA by others within those entities, and (y) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to MBNAs outside auditors and the audit committee of MBNAs Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect MBNAs ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in MBNAs internal controls over financial reporting. These disclosures were made in writing by management to MBNAs auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to Bank of America. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.   

 (d) Since December 31, 2004, (i) through the date hereof, neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the officers of MBNA, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no attorney representing MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material violation of securities laws, breach    ##### 

  

    

of fiduciary duty or similar violation by MBNA or any of its officers,
directors, employees or agents to the Board of Directors of MBNA or any
committee thereof or to any director or officer of MBNA.   

 3.7 _Broker s Fees_. Neither MBNA nor any MBNA Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokers fees, commissions or finders fees in connection with the Merger or related transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than as set forth on Section 3.7 of the MBNA Disclosure Schedule and pursuant to letter agreements, true, complete and correct copies of which have been previously delivered to Bank of America.   

 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. (a) Since December 31, 2004, no event or events have occurred that have had or are reasonably likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on MBNA. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to Bank of America, MBNA or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, a material adverse effect on (i) the business, results of operations or financial condition of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect shall not be deemed to include effects to the extent resulting from (A) changes, after the date hereof, in generally accepted accounting principles or regulatory accounting requirements applicable to banks or savings associations and their holding companies, or to credit card companies, generally, (B) changes, after the date hereof, in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to banks or savings associations and their holding companies, or to credit card companies, generally, or interpretations thereof by courts or Governmental Entities, (C) changes, after the date hereof, in global or national political conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in general economic or market conditions affecting banks, credit card companies, savings associations or their holding companies generally except to the extent that such changes in general economic or market conditions have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on such party or (D) consummation or public disclosure of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), or (ii) the ability of such party to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 (b) Since December 31, 2004 through and including the date of this Agreement, MBNA and its Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with their past practice.   

 (c) Since December 31, 2004, neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) except for (A) normal increases for employees (other than officers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act) made in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice or (B) as required by applicable law or pre-existing contractual obligations, increased the wages, salaries, compensation, pension, or other fringe benefits or perquisites payable to any executive officer, employee, or director from the amount thereof in effect as of December 31, 2004, granted any severance or termination pay, entered into any contract to make or grant any severance or termination pay (in each case, except as required under the terms of agreements or severance plans listed on Section 3.11 of the MBNA Disclosure Schedule, as in effect as of the date hereof ), or paid any bonus other than the customary year-end bonuses in amounts consistent with past practice, (ii) granted any options to purchase shares    ##### 

  

    

of MBNA Common Stock, any restricted shares of MBNA Common Stock or any right

the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act) made in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice under the MBNA
Stock Plans, (iii) changed any accounting methods, principles or practices of
MBNA or its Subsidiaries affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses,
including any reserving, renewal or residual method, practice or policy or
(iv) suffered any strike, work stoppage, slow-down, or other labor
disturbance.   

 3.9 _Legal Proceedings_. (a) Neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of MBNAs knowledge, threatened, material legal, administrative, arbitral or other material proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of any nature against MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries. None of the proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations set forth on Section 3.9 of the MBNA Disclosure Schedules would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on MBNA.   

 (b) There is no Injunction, judgment, or regulatory restriction (other than those of general application that apply to similarly situated bank holding companies or their Subsidiaries) imposed upon MBNA, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries.

The federal income Tax returns of MBNA and its Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") for all years to and including 2000 and any liability with respect thereto has been satisfied or any liability with respect to deficiencies asserted as a result of such examination is covered by reserves that are adequate under GAAP. There are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted, for Taxes or assessments upon MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries for which MBNA does not have reserves that are adequate under GAAP. Neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by any Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement (other than such an agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among MBNA and its Subsidiaries). Within the past five years, neither MBNA nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify under Section 355(a) of the Code.

These disclosures were made in writing by management to Bank of Americas auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made available to MBNA. As of the date hereof, there is no reason to believe that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.    #####

 (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "), including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of MBNA or any of its    ##### 

  

    

Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of MBNA or any of its
Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or employee of MBNA or any
of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time or (ii) this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and
use their best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in their respective certificates or articles of
incorporation or by-laws (or comparable organizational documents), and any
existing indemnification agreements set forth in Section 6.7 of the
MBNA Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such
individuals for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
or taken at the request of Bank of America pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof, it
being understood that nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation.   

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, each Indemnified Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of MBNA or any Subsidiary of MBNA, and pertaining to any matter existing or occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or after, the Effective Time (including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) or taken at the request of Bank of America pursuant to Section 6.8 hereof.   

 (c) Bank of America shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the directors and officers liability insurance policy maintained by MBNA ( _provided_ that Bank of America may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such;  _provided_ that in no event shall Bank of America be required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by MBNA (which current amount is set forth in Section 6.7 of the MBNA Disclosure Schedule) for such insurance (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided_ _further_ that if Bank of America is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Bank of America shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.   

 6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Bank of America, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of MBNA, on the other) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall, at Bank of Americas sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by Bank of America.   

 6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of Bank of America and MBNA shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; and _provided_   _further_ that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied.   

 6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. Prior to the Effective Time, Bank of America and MBNA shall each take all such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of MBNA Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such shares of MBNA Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, including any such actions specified in the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, LLP.   

 6.11 _No Solicitation_.   

 (a) None of MBNA, its Subsidiaries or any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries shall directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) or take any other action designed to facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding any merger, share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by way of a tender offer) or similar transactions involving MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing inquiries or proposals being referred to herein as an " _Alternative Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of MBNA shall be permitted, prior to the meeting of MBNA stockholders to be held pursuant to    ##### 

  

    

Section 6.3, and subject to compliance with the other terms of this Section
6.11 and to first entering into a confidentiality agreement with the person
proposing such Alternative Proposal on terms substantially similar to, and no
less favorable to MBNA than, those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, to consider and participate in discussions and negotiations with
respect to a bona fide Alternative Proposal received by MBNA, if and only to
the extent that and so long as the Board of Directors of MBNA reasonably
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
failure to do so would cause it to violate its fiduciary duties.   

 As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i) a transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Bank of America or its affiliates), directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than 25% of the outstanding shares of MBNA Common Stock or outstanding voting power or of any new series or new class of preferred stock that would be entitled to a class or series vote with respect to the Merger, whether from MBNA or pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination involving MBNA (other than the Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any person (or group of persons) (other than Bank of America or its affiliates) acquires or would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity securities of subsidiaries of MBNA and securities of the entity surviving any merger or business combination including any of MBNAs Subsidiaries) of MBNA, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of MBNA and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction, or (iv) any other consolidation, business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of MBNA immediately prior to such transactions do not, in the aggregate, own at least 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such holders held the shares of MBNA Common Stock immediately prior to the consummation thereof.   

 (b) MBNA shall notify Bank of America promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt of any Alternative Proposal, or any material modification of or material amendment to any Alternative Proposal, or any request for nonpublic information relating to MBNA or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of MBNA or any Subsidiary by any Person or entity that informs the Board of Directors of MBNA or any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Alternative Proposal. Such notice to Bank of America shall be made orally and in writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Alternative Proposal or intending to make or considering making an Alternative Proposal or requesting non-public information or access to the books and records of MBNA or any Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or modification or amendment to an Alternative Proposal. MBNA shall keep Bank of America fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such Alternative Proposal, indication or request. MBNA shall also promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Bank of America, orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Alternative Proposal in accordance with Section 6.11(a).    ##### 

  

  

 (c) MBNA and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons (other than Bank of America) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other than Bank of America who have been furnished confidential information regarding MBNA in connection with the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Proposal within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly to return or destroy such information. MBNA agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to, release any third party from the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any agreement to which MBNA or its Subsidiaries is or may become a party, and shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate any approval that may have been heretofore given under any such provisions authorizing any person to make an Alternative Proposal. Neither MBNA nor the Board of Directors of MBNA shall approve or take any action to render inapplicable to any Alternative Proposal or Alternative Transaction Sections 3-601 to 3-604 and 3-701 to 3-709 of the MGCL and any similar Takeover Statutes.   

 (d) MBNA shall ensure that the officers, directors and all employees, agents and representatives (including any investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other retained representatives) of MBNA or its Subsidiaries are aware of the restrictions described in this Section 6.11 as reasonably necessary to avoid violations thereof. It is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.11 by any officer, director, employee, agent or representative (including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other retained representative) of MBNA or its Subsidiaries, at the direction or with the consent of MBNA or its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.11 by MBNA.   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.11 shall prohibit MBNA or its Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position required by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   

 6.12 _Directorship_. Bank of America shall, prior to the Effective Time, take such actions as may be required to appoint an individual mutually agreed by MBNA and Bank of America to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time, and, to the extent so required, shall increase the size of the Bank of America Board of Directors to permit the foregoing.   

 6.13 _Restructuring Efforts_. If MBNA shall have failed to obtain the requisite vote or votes of its stockholders for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at a duly held meeting of its stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, then, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to its terms, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration in a manner adverse to such party or its stockholders) and to resubmit the transaction to MBNAs stockholders for approval, with the timing of such resubmission to be determined at the request of Bank of America.    ##### 

  

  

 6.14 _MBNA Cumulative Preferred Stock_. MBNA shall redeem all shares of its 71/2% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and Series B Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, in each case in accordance with the terms thereof, at or prior to the Closing.   

 6.15 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Bank of America and MBNA shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect of Bank of America Common Stock and MBNA Common Stock and the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of MBNA Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, for any quarter with respect to their shares of MBNA Common Stock and any shares of Bank of America Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 (c) by either MBNA or Bank of America, if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;   

 (d) by either Bank of America or MBNA (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of MBNA, in the case of a termination by Bank of America, or Bank of America, in the case of a termination by    #####

THE TRANSFER OF THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO   

CERTAIN PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO

   

RESALE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE

   

SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED

    

 STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated June 30, 2005, between MBNA Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Issuer"), and Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Grantee").   

 _W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :    

 WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), which agreement has been executed by the parties hereto in connection with this Stock Option Agreement (the "Agreement"); and   

 WHEREAS, as a condition to Grantees entering into the Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined);   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

 1. (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional, irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up to 249,764,005 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Issuers Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Common Stock"), at a price of $21.30 per share (the "Option Price"); _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the Issuers issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock without giving effect to any shares subject to or issued pursuant to the Option. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein set forth.   

 (b) In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are either (i) issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other than pursuant to this Agreement) or (ii) redeemed, repurchased, retired or otherwise cease to be outstanding after the date of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the Option shall be increased or decreased, as appropriate, so that, after such issuance, such number equals 19.9% of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement.   

 2. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option, in whole or part, and from time to time, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined) shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as hereinafter defined), _provided_ that the Holder shall have sent the written notice of such exercise (as provided in    ##### 

  

    

subsection (e) of this Section 2) within 180 days following such Subsequent
Triggering Event. Each of the following shall be an "Exercise Termination
Event": (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the
Merger; (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with the
provisions thereof if such termination occurs prior to the occurrence of an
Initial Triggering Event except a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section
8.1(d) (unless the breach by Issuer giving rise to such right of termination
is non-volitional) or Section 8.1(e) of the Merger Agreement; or (iii) the
passage of 18 months after termination of the Merger Agreement if
such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event or is
a termination by Grantee pursuant to Section 8.1(d) (unless the breach by
Issuer giving rise to such right of termination is non-volitional) or Section
8.1(e) of the Merger Agreement. The term "Holder" shall mean the holder or
holders of the Option.   

 (b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" shall mean any of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:   

 (i) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"), without having received Grantees prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with any person (the term "person" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries (each a "Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors of Issuer shall have recommended that the stockholders of Issuer approve or accept any Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a Subsidiary of Grantee. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (w) a merger, consolidation or share exchange, or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) of Issuer, (x) a purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, (y) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer, or (z) any substantially similar transaction;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall any merger, consolidation, purchase or similar transaction involving only the Issuer and one or more of its Subsidiaries or involving only any two or more of such Subsidiaries, be deemed to be an Acquisition Transaction, _provided_  that any such transaction is not entered into in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement;   

 (ii) Any event set forth in Section 8.1(e) of the Merger Agreement shall have occurred;   

 (iii) Any person other than Grantee, any Grantee Subsidiary or any Issuer Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity in the ordinary course of its business shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder);     ##### 

  

     

 (iv) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary shall have made a _bona fide_  proposal to Issuer or its stockholders that is public or becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage in an Acquisition Transaction;   

 (v) After the receipt by Issuer or its stockholders of any _bona fide_ inquiry or proposal (or the _bona fide_ indication of any intention to propose) from a third party to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, Issuer shall have breached any covenant or obligation contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach (x) would entitle Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement and (y) shall not have been cured prior to the Notice Date (as defined below); or   

 (vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which Grantee has given its prior written consent, shall have filed an application or notice with the Federal Reserve Board, or other federal or state bank regulatory authority, which application or notice has been accepted for processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction.   

 (c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall mean either of the following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:   

 (i) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or   

 (ii) The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event described in paragraph (i) of subsection (b) of this Section 2, except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) shall be 20%.   

 (d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event (together, a "Triggering Event") of which it has knowledge, it being understood that the giving of such notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise the Option.   

 (e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice Date for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); _provided_ that if prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board or any other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder shall as soon as reasonably practicable file the required notice or application for approval and shall expeditiously process the same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.   

 (f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section 2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of Common Stock purchased    ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately available funds by wire
transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer, _provided_ that failure or
refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account shall not preclude the
Holder from exercising the Option.   

 (g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of immediately available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2, Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder, and the Holder shall deliver to Issuer this Agreement and a letter agreeing that the Holder will not offer to sell or otherwise dispose of such shares in violation of applicable law or the provisions of this Agreement.   

 (h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read substantially as follows:    

"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject to
certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder hereof and
Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended. A copy of such agreement is on file at the principal office of
Issuer and will be provided to the holder hereof without charge upon receipt
by Issuer of a written request therefor."   

 It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Issuer, to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii) the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by law.   

 (i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2 and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall pay all expenses, and any and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may be payable in connection with the preparation, issuance and delivery of stock certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee, transferee or designee.   

 3. Issuer agrees: (i) subject to the proviso at the end of this clause, that it shall at all times maintain, free from preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued shares    ##### 

  

    

of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional
authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options,
warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock;
_provided_ that, if on the Notice Date Issuer does not have sufficient
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be
exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock, Issuer shall
promptly take the necessary corporate actions (including seeking the
requisite stockholder approval) to authorize the necessary number of
additional shares of Common Stock (or, if such corporate action is not or
cannot be taken within a reasonable amount of time, Issuer shall take all
required action to authorize for issuance under this Option, in lieu of such
additional shares of Common Stock, shares of a series of voting participating
preferred stock of Issuer providing substantially equivalent economic and
voting rights in the aggregate to the holder thereof as such shares of Common
Stock, in which case all references in this Agreement to Common Stock shall
be deemed to include, to the extent appropriate, such shares of voting
participating preferred stock); (ii) that it will not, by charter
amendment or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or
sale of assets, or by any other voluntary act, avoid or seek to avoid the
observance or performance of any of the covenants, stipulations or conditions
to be observed or performed hereunder by Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all
action as may from time to time be required (including (x) complying with all
premerger notification, reporting and waiting period requirements specified
in 15 U.S.C. § 18a and regulations promulgated thereunder and (y) in the
event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"),
or the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended, or any state banking
law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board or to any state
or other regulatory authority is necessary before the Option may be
exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such applications
or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve Board or
such other regulatory authority as they may require) in order to permit the
Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly and effectively to issue shares
of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv) promptly to take all action
provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder against dilution.   

 4. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable, without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of this Agreement at the principal office of Issuer, for other Agreements providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any Stock Option Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be enforceable by anyone.   

 5. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Option and the Option    ##### 

  

    

Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this
Section 5\. In the event of any change in, or distributions in respect of,
the Common Stock by reason of stock dividends, split-ups, mergers,
recapitalizations, combinations, subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of
shares, distributions on or in respect of the Common Stock that would be
prohibited under the terms of the Merger Agreement, or the like, the type and
number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof and the
Option Price shall be appropriately adjusted in such manner as shall fully
preserve the economic benefits provided hereunder and proper provision
shall be made in any agreement governing any such transaction to provide for
such proper adjustment and the full satisfaction of the Issuers obligations
hereunder.   

 6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee delivered within 180 days of such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a shelf registration statement under the 1933 Act covering this Option and any shares issued and issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit the sale or other disposition of this Option and any shares of Common Stock (and/or shares of voting participating preferred stock of Issuer) issued upon total or partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in accordance with any plan of disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall have the right to demand two such registrations. The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time of any request by Grantee for registration of the Option or Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such offering the inclusion of the Holders Option or Option Shares would interfere with the successful marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby may be reduced; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any such required reduction the number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and  _provided further_ , _however_ , that if such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for the balance as promptly as practicable and no reduction shall thereafter occur. Each such Holder shall provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties, indemnities and other agreements customarily included in secondary offering underwriting agreements for the Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the persons entitled to receive such copies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Issuer be obligated    ##### 

  

    

to effect more than two registrations pursuant to this Section 6 by reason of
the fact that there shall be more than one Grantee as a result of any
assignment or division of this Agreement.   

 7. (a) Immediately prior to, or after, the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (as defined below), (i) following a request of the Holder, delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer (or any successor thereto) shall repurchase the Option from the Holder immediately prior to the Repurchase Event (or, as requested by the Holder, after the Repurchase Event) at a price (the "Option Repurchase Price") equal to the product of the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised multiplied by the amount by which (A) the Market/Offer Price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares from time to time (the "Owner"), delivered prior to an Exercise Termination Event and within 90 days of the occurrence of a Repurchase Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a price (the "Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Market/Offer Price multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated. The term "Market/Offer Price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common Stock at which a tender offer or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv) in the event of a sale of all or a substantial portion of Issuers assets, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets and the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the Market/Offer Price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Issuer.   

 (b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement or certificates for Option Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7\. Within the latter to occur of (x) five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto and (y) the time that is immediately prior to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price therefor or the portion thereof, if any, that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.   

 (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the    ##### 

  

    

Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited
from delivering, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is
no longer so prohibited;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if Issuer at any time
after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this
Section 7 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to
the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the Option Repurchase Price and
the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in full (and Issuer hereby
undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and
legal approvals and to file any required notices, in each case as promptly as
practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or Owner may
revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares either
in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case,
Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as
appropriate, that portion of the Option Repurchase Price or the Option Share
Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and
(ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new Stock Option
Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of
shares of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common
Stock for which the surrendered Stock Option Agreement was exercisable at the
time of delivery of the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore
delivered to the Holder and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase
Price, or (B) to the Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so
prohibited from repurchasing.   

 (d) For purposes of this Section 7, a Repurchase Event shall be deemed to have occurred (i) upon the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction with respect to Issuer (and not solely involving one or more subsidiaries of Issuer) (except that the percentage referred to in clause (y) of the definition thereof shall be 50%) or (ii) upon the acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock.   

 8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to permit any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, to merge into Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding voting shares and voting share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any person, other than Grantee or one of its Subsidiaries, then, and in each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or (y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.   

 (b) The following terms have the meanings indicated:    

 (A) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if other than    ##### 

  

    

Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the continuing or
surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or substantially all of
Issuers assets.    

 (B) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the Substitute Option.    

 (C) "Assigned Value" shall mean the Market/Offer Price, as defined in Section 7.    

 (D) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of a share of the Substitute Common Stock for the one year immediately preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no event higher than the closing price of the  shares of Substitute Common Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale; _provided_ that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may elect.   

 (c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the Option, _provided_ , that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement, which shall be applicable to the Substitute Option.   

 (d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.   

 (e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Issuer") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Acquiring Corporation.    ##### 

  

  

 (f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of Issuer hereunder.   

 9. (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the "Substitute Option Holder"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price") equal to the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option may then be exercised, and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute Share Owner") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"), the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price (the "Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to the Highest Closing Price multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated. The term "Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.   

 (b) The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option (or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions of this Section 9\. As promptly as practicable, and in any event within five business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price therefor or, in either case, the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.   

 (c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer following a request for repurchase pursuant to this Section 9 shall immediately so notify the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no longer so prohibited; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Substitute Option Issuer is at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 9 prohibited under applicable law or regulation from delivering to the Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the Substitute Option Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price,    ##### 

  

    

respectively, in full (and the Substitute Option Issuer shall use its best
efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals, in each case
as promptly as practicable, in order to accomplish such repurchase), the
Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner may revoke its notice of
repurchase of the Substitute Option or the Substitute Shares either in whole
or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter case, the
Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Substitute Option
Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, that portion of the
Substitute Option Repurchase Price or the Substitute Share Repurchase
Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering;
and (ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Substitute Option Holder,
a new Substitute Option evidencing the right of the Substitute Option Holder
to purchase that number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock obtained by
multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock for which
the surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the time of delivery of
the notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Substitute Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore
delivered to the Substitute Option Holder and the denominator of which is
the Substitute Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Substitute Share Owner,
a certificate for the Substitute Common Shares it is then so prohibited from
repurchasing.   

 10. The 90-day or 180-day periods for exercise of certain rights under Sections 2, 6, 7 and 13 shall be extended: (i) to the extent necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights and for the expiration of all statutory waiting periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise.   

 11. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows:    

 (a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Issuer.    

 (b) Subject to the proviso at the end of this sentence, Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance pursuant hereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens, encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights; _provided_ that, if on the Notice Date Issuer does not have sufficient authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional authorization of Common Stock, Issuer shall promptly take the necessary corporate actions (including seeking the requisite stockholder approval) to authorize the necessary number of additional shares of Common    ##### 

  

    

Stock (or, if such corporate action is not or cannot be taken within a
reasonable amount of time, Issuer shall take all required action to authorize
for issuance under this Option, in lieu of such additional shares of Common
Stock, shares of a series of voting participating preferred stock of Issuer
providing substantially equivalent economic and voting rights in the
aggregate to the holder thereof as such shares of Common Stock, in which case
all references in this Agreement to Common Stock shall be deemed to include,
to the extent appropriate, such shares of voting participating preferred
stock).    

 (c) The Board of Directors of Issuer has unanimously approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and taken any other action as required to render inapplicable to such agreement and transactions Sections 3-601 to 3-604 and 3-701 to 3-709 of the MGCL and, to the knowledge of Issuer, any similar Takeover Statutes.   

 12. Grantee hereby represents and warrants to Issuer that:    

 (a) Grantee has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to any approvals or consents referred to herein, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Grantee. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Grantee.    

 (b) The Option is not being, and any shares of Common Stock or other securities acquired by Grantee upon exercise of the Option will not be, acquired with a view to the public distribution thereof and will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a transaction registered or exempt from registration under the 1933 Act.   

 13. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or the Option created hereunder to any other person, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof, may assign in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 180 days following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as provided in Section 10); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that until the date 15 days following the date on which the Federal Reserve Board approves an application by Grantee under the BHCA to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, Grantee may not assign its rights under the Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one party acquires the right to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment to a single party ( _e.g._ , a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on Grantees behalf, or (iv) any other manner approved by the Federal Reserve Board.   

 14. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to make all filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation making application to list the shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder on the New York    ##### 

  

    

Stock Exchange upon official notice of issuance and applying to the Federal
Reserve Board under the BHCA for approval to acquire the shares issuable
hereunder, but Grantee shall not be obligated to apply to state banking
authorities for approval to acquire the shares of Common Stock issuable
hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems appropriate to do so.   

 15. (a) Grantee may, at any time during which Issuer would be required to repurchase the Option or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7 upon proper request or notice, surrender the Option (together with any Option Shares issued to and then owned by Grantee) to Issuer in exchange for a cash fee equal to the Surrender Price (as defined below); _provided_ , _however_ , that Grantee may not exercise its rights pursuant to this Section 15 if Issuer has repurchased the Option (or any portion thereof) or any Option Shares pursuant to Section 7\. The "Surrender Price" shall be equal to (i) $1.0559 billion, plus (ii) if applicable, the aggregate purchase price previously paid pursuant hereto by Grantee with respect to any Option Shares, minus (iii) if applicable, the sum of (A) the excess of (1) the net cash amounts, if any, received by Grantee pursuant to the arms length sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares were converted or exchanged) to any party not affiliated with Grantee, over (2) the aggregate purchase price previously paid pursuant hereto by Grantee with respect to such Option Shares and (B) the net cash amounts, if any, received by Grantee pursuant to an arms length sale of a portion of the Option to any party not affiliated with Grantee.   

 (b) Grantee may exercise its right to surrender the Option and any Option Shares pursuant to this Section 15 by surrendering to Issuer, at its principal office, this Agreement together with certificates for Option Shares, if any, accompanied by a written notice stating (i) that Grantee elects to surrender the Option and Option Shares, if any, in accordance with the provisions of this Section 15 and (ii) the Surrender Price. The Surrender Price shall be payable in immediately available funds on or before the second business day following receipt of such notice by Issuer.   

 (c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from paying the Surrender Price to Grantee in full, Issuer shall immediately so notify Grantee and thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to Grantee, the portion of the Surrender Price that Issuer is no longer prohibited from paying, within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so prohibited, _provided_ , _however_ , that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a notice of surrender pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 15 is prohibited under applicable law or regulation from paying to Grantee the Surrender Price in full (i) Issuer shall (A) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as promptly as practicable in order to make such payments, (B) within five days of the submission or receipt of any documents relating to any such regulatory and legal approvals, provide Grantee with copies of the same, and (C) keep Grantee advised of both the status of any such request for regulatory and legal approvals, as well as any discussions with any relevant regulatory or other third party reasonably related to the same and (ii) Grantee may revoke such notice of surrender by delivery of a notice of revocation to Issuer and, upon delivery of such notice of revocation, the Exercise Termination Date shall be extended to a date six months from the date on which the Exercise Termination Date would have occurred if not for the provisions of this Section 15(c) (during which period Grantee may exercise any of its rights hereunder, including any and all rights pursuant to this Section 15).    ##### 

  

  

 (d) Grantee shall have rights substantially identical to those set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 15 with respect to the Substitute Option and the Substitute Option Issuer during any period in which the Substitute Option Issuer would be required to repurchase the Substitute Option pursuant to Section 9.   

 16. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall the Grantees Total Profit (as hereinafter defined) exceed $1.4078 billion and, if it otherwise would exceed such amount, the Grantee, at its sole election, shall either (i) reduce the number of shares of Common Stock subject to this Option, (ii) deliver to Issuer for cancellation Option Shares previously purchased by Grantee, (iii) pay cash to Issuer, or (iv) any combination thereof, so that Grantees actually realized Total Profit shall not exceed $1.4078 billion after taking into account the foregoing actions.   

 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Option may not be exercised for a number of shares as would, as of the date of exercise, result in a Notional Total Profit (as defined below) of more than $1.4078 billion; _provided_ that nothing in this sentence shall restrict any exercise of the Option permitted hereby on any subsequent date.   

 (c) As used herein, the term "Total Profit" shall mean the aggregate amount (before taxes) of the following: (i) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuers repurchase of the Option (or any portion thereof) pursuant to Section 7, (ii) (x) the amount received by Grantee pursuant to Issuers repurchase of Option Shares pursuant to Section 7, less (y) the Grantees purchase price for such Option Shares, (iii) (x) the net cash amounts received by Grantee pursuant to the sale of Option Shares (or any other securities into which such Option Shares are converted or exchanged) to any unaffiliated party, less (y) the Grantees purchase price of such Option Shares, (iv) any amounts received by Grantee on the transfer of the Option (or any portion thereof) to any unaffiliated party, and (v) any amount equivalent to the foregoing with respect to the Substitute Option.   

 (d) As used herein, the term "Notional Total Profit" with respect to any number of shares as to which Grantee may propose to exercise this Option shall be the Total Profit determined as of the date of such proposed exercise assuming that this Option were exercised on such date for such number of shares and assuming that such shares, together with all other Option Shares held by Grantee and its affiliates as of such date, were sold for cash at the closing market price for the Common Stock as of the close of business on the preceding trading day (less customary brokerage commissions).   

 17. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief.   

 18. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that the    ##### 

  

    

Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to repurchase
pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock provided in
Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5 hereof), it is
the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or to require
Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be
permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.   

 19. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by cable, telegram, telecopy or telex, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the Merger Agreement.   

 20. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof (except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal or state law apply).   

 21. This Agreement may be executed in two counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

 22. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers, accountants and counsel.   

 23. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger Agreement, this Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.   

 24. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.    #####

 _Exhibit B_    

Form of Affiliate Letter    

Bank of America Corporation    

 _ _ _ _    

 _ _ _ _    

Ladies and Gentlemen:    

 I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of MBNA Corporation, a Maryland corporation (" _MBNA_ "), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 30, 2005 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and between Bank of America Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Bank of America_ "), and MBNA, MBNA shall be merged with and into Bank of America (the " _Merger_ "). All terms used in this letter but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.   

 I represent, warrant and covenant to Bank of America that in the event I receive any Bank of America Common Stock as a result of the Merger:   

 (a) I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of Bank of America Common Stock in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.   

 (b) I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed its requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Bank of America Common Stock to the extent I believed necessary with my counsel or counsel for MBNA.   

 (c) I have been advised that the issuance of Bank of America Common Stock to me pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that, since at the time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of MBNA I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of MBNA and the distribution by me of Bank of America Common Stock has not been registered under the Act, I may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of Bank of America Common Stock issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Bank of America, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.   

 (d) I understand that Bank of America is under no obligation to register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Bank of America Common Stock by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.    ##### 

  

  

 (e) I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Bank of Americas transfer agents with respect to Bank of America Common Stock and that there will be placed on the certificates for Bank of America Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:    

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold or otherwise transferred in compliance with the
requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration statement under said
act or an exemption from such registration."   

 (f) I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Bank of America Common Stock has been registered under the Act or is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145, Bank of America reserves the right to put the following legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:    

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under
the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from a person who received such
shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired by the holder not with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold, pledged or
otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."   

 It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates without such legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to Bank of Americas transfer agent removing such stop transfer instructions, and the above restrictions on sale will cease to apply, if (A) one year (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (B) if two years (or such other period as may be required by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Securities Act or any successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Effective Date and the provisions of such Rule are then available to me; or (C) I shall have delivered to Bank of America (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to Bank of America, to the effect that such legend and/or stop transfer instructions are not required for purposes of the Securities Act or (ii) reasonably satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by such certificates are being or have been transferred in a transaction made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities Act.   

 I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse, (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as    ##### 

  

    

trustee, executor or in any similar capacity and (iv) any corporate or other
organization in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% of
any class of equity securities or of the equity interest.   

 It is understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.   

 Execution of this letter should not be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of MBNA as described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.        |   |   |   |
