corporation (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Parent
has agreed to cause Merger Sub to commence a tender offer (as it may be
extended, amended or supplemented from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any and all of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per
share (each, a " _Share_ "), at a price of $90.00 per Share, net to the
seller in cash, without interest thereon (such amount, or any greater amount
per Share paid pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ ");

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that
Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement with the Company continuing as
the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the "
_Merger_ "), with the Merger being governed by Section 251(h) of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _Corporation Law_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (a)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its stockholders, (b) approved and declared advisable this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (c) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the
Company tender all of their Shares into the Offer;

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, approved this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, unanimously (a) determined that this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are in the best interests of its stockholders and (b) approved
and declared advisable this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby;

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent and
Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement, concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, certain of the stockholders of the Company are
entering into tender and support agreements with Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed, among other things, to tender
Shares (totaling, in the aggregate, approximately 24.7% of the outstanding
Shares) to Merger Sub in the Offer; and WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Section 9.11_
hereof; 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations, warranties
and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE OFFER 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.01_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
as promptly as practicable after the Agreement Date (and in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days after the date of the initial public announcement
of this Agreement), commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the
Offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price.

 

(b) The obligation of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver (as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_ below)
of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ "). On the
terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Tendered Shares_ ") as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date (as
defined in _Section 1.01(e)_ below) and in compliance with applicable Law (as
defined in _Section 4.12(a)_ below). The acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date and time at which the Offer
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_."
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub on or prior to
the date of the Offer Closing funds necessary to purchase and pay for any and
all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and
purchase pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any of the
Offer Conditions other than the Minimum Condition (which Minimum Condition
may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub only with the prior written consent of
the Company), and to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in
the terms and conditions of the Offer not inconsistent with the terms of
this Agreement; _provided_ that, unless otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, Parent and Merger
Sub shall not: (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought
to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) impose

 



2  conditions on the Offer in addition to the Offer Conditions or amend any
Offer Condition, (iv) waive or amend the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any
other term of the Offer in a manner that is adverse to the holders of Shares,
or (vi) extend the Expiration Date except as required or permitted by _Section
1.01(e)_.

 

(d) On the date the Offer is commenced, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall include an offer to purchase, letter
of transmittal, summary advertisement and other required ancillary offer
documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cause
the Offer Documents to comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of applicable Law. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent
and Merger Sub all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable Law or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub to be set forth
in the Offer Documents. Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and
Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the
Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and
its counsel in writing with any written comments (and shall orally describe
any oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from
time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing of the Offer
Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or responding to any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
reasonable consideration to any comments provided by the Company. Parent and
Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such
SEC comments.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the
Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the
20th business day (for purposes of this _Section 1.01(e)_ calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that
the Offer is commenced (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the period
of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and
in accordance with, this _Section 1.01(e)_ or as may be required by
applicable Law, the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended (the
Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date to which the Offer has
been extended in accordance with this _Section 1.01(e)_, the " _Expiration
Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, on the then-effective
Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or
waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer for successive periods of not more than ten (10) Business Days (the
length of such period to be determined by Merger Sub), or for such longer
period as the parties may agree, in order to permit the satisfaction of the
Offer Conditions (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the
Offer shall not be extended pursuant to this clause (i) if all Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or waived), and (ii) Merger

 



3  Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any
period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC
or its staff applicable to the Offer or necessary to resolve any comments of
the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents;
_provided_ that (A) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), Merger Sub shall not
in any event be required to, and without the Companys prior written consent
shall not, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as defined in _Section
8.01(c)_ below) and (B) in the case of clause (i), in the event that each
Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) shall have been satisfied
or waived as of any then-effective Expiration Date and the Minimum Condition
shall not have been satisfied as of such Expiration Date, then Merger Sub
shall not in any event be required to extend the Offer pursuant to clause (i)
beyond the date that is twenty (20) business days after such Expiration Date,
but may in its sole discretion elect to do so, subject to _Section
1.01(e)_(A). Nothing in this _Section 1.01(e)_ shall be deemed to impair,
limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any event
within one (1) Business Day of such termination) terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement
is terminated in accordance with _Section 8.01_, prior to the acceptance for
payment of Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly return, and shall cause any depository acting on
behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

Section 1.02 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company shall file with the SEC, on the same day the Offer Documents
are filed with the SEC, a Solicitation/ Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that, subject to _Section 6.02(e)_
contains the recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), the fairness opinions of the
Companys financial advisors referenced in _Section 4.21_ and the notice and
other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of the Corporation Law, and
shall as promptly as practicable disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the holders
of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Law, including by
setting the Stockholder List Date (as defined in _Section 1.02(b)_ below) as
the record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section
262(d)(2) of the Corporation Law. The Company shall cause the Schedule
14D-9 to comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of
applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required by
applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the
Schedule 14D-9. Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The
Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with any
written comments (and shall orally describe any oral comments) that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.
Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of
Shares, or responding to any

 



4  comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall
provide Parent and Merger Sub with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall give
reasonable consideration to any comments provided by Parent or Merger Sub. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such SEC
comments.

 

(b) The Company shall reasonably promptly after the Agreement Date provide to
Parent, or cause to be provided to Parent, a list of the holders of Shares as
well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing
the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders of Shares and
lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each
case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date and shall
promptly furnish Parent with such additional information and assistance
(including updated lists of the record and beneficial holders of Shares,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Parent or its agents may
reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the holders of Shares
(the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer
Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List
Date_ "). Except as required by applicable Law, and except as necessary to
communicate regarding the Offer and the Merger with the holders of Shares,
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective representatives) shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger,
and, if this Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated,
shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all
copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their
possession or in the possession of their representatives.

 

(c) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub
effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with  _Section
2.02_, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify
in such certificate of merger (the date and time at which the Merger becomes
effective, the " _Effective Time_ "). The Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") under the name "ZS

to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of

required by the Corporation Law, and the parties shall take all such further
actions as may be required by Law to make the Merger effective. Prior to the
filing referred to in _Section 2.01_ and this _Section 2.02_, as soon as
practicable following the satisfaction or waiver, if permissible, of the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to their
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver, at the Closing) or on such other day
as the parties may mutually agree, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") will be held at the offices of Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP, 2475 Hanover
Street, Palo Alto, California 94304 (or such other place as the parties may
mutually agree). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 2.03 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the Corporation Law. From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all of the
rights, powers, privileges, franchises and be subject to all of the

Merger Sub, all as provided in the Corporation Law.

Section 2.04  _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended and restated
in its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
Sub, except that all references therein to Merger Sub shall be automatically
amended and shall become references to the Surviving Corporation. At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as permitted therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 2.05 _Directors and Officers_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each person who is a member of the Company Board
immediately prior to the Effective Time to resign as of the Effective Time. At
the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of
the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been
duly elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE III

 

CONSIDERATION; PAYMENT FOR SHARES AND OTHER EQUITY INTERESTS

 

Section 3.01 _Conversion of Shares; Cancellation of Treasury Shares and
Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or held in the treasury of the Company,
and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 3.08(a)_ below),
which shall have only those rights set forth in _Section 3.08_) shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be converted at the Effective Time
into the right to receive in cash (without interest) an amount per Share
(subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the Offer Price (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares (each as defined in _Section 3.03(b)_ below), as applicable, in

 



6  accordance with this _Article III_. At the Effective Time all such Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Certificates or Book Entry Shares (in each
case representing such Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided
herein. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that is at such time owned by Parent or Merger Sub or held in the
treasury of the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof,
be canceled and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Share held by any
Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than the Merger Sub)
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number
of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation, such that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Section 3.02 _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be
converted at the Effective Time into and become one (1) share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 3.03 _Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make
the aggregate payments of the Merger Consideration due pursuant to _Section
3.01_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, in each case shall not include the
Option Payoff Amount or the Merger Consideration payable with respect to
Restricted Stock Units) (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall make the payments provided for in
the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (x) no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration
payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to this Agreement, (y) following
any such losses that result in the amount of funds in the Payment Fund being
insufficient to promptly pay the portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration
that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent to the extent of such insufficiency, and (z) such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in
commercial paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investor
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Rating Services, respectively. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investment shall be paid solely to
Parent. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as
provided in this Agreement.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each Person who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, was
the record holder of Shares whose Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.01_: (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the certificates that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented

 



7  Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary
form reasonably satisfactory to the Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("
_Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.
Following surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash
in an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product
of the number of Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
multiplied by the Merger Consideration, and such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the
Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable. Payment with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall
only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. From and after the Effective Time and until surrendered in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.03_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates and Book-Entry Shares representing
any Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes solely the right to
receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the Merger Consideration
multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to
the Shares formerly represented thereby.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares for twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any former holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares who have not complied with this _Section
3.03_ prior to the end of such twelve (12) month period shall thereafter look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
but only as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. None of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such
Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been
surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such
Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



8 (e) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.03_, any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 3.03_ to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to
Parent or its designee upon Parents demand.

 

Section 3.04 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this _Article III_.

Section 3.05 _Company Options and Restricted Stock Units; ESPP._

 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Shares (collectively, the "
_Company Options_ ") granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans shall be
treated as provided below, _provided_ , that, all unvested Company Options
held by a non-employee director of the Company shall be treated as
having vested immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent that a
Company Option is vested or, by its terms, becomes vested as of the Effective
Time, such vested portion of such Company Option shall, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, automatically be canceled and terminated as of
the Effective Time (to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time),
and the holder thereof shall become entitled to receive an amount of cash, if
any, from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the total
number of Shares underlying such vested portion of such Company Option
_multiplied by_ (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share of such vested portion of such Company Option
without interest and subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes
required by applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with _Section 3.06_
(the " _Option Payoff Amount_ "). To the extent that a Company Option, by its
terms, is not and does not become vested as of the Effective Time, such
unvested portion of such Company Option shall be converted into a number of
ordinary shares of restricted stock of Ultimate Parent equal to (A)
the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise
price of the unvested portion of such Company Option _multiplied by_ the
number of Shares covered by the unvested portion of such Company Option,
_divided by _ (B) the fair market value of an ordinary share of Ultimate
Parent (each, an "Ultimate Parent _Share_ ") at the Effective Time (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) (the " _Restricted Shares_ ").
Each Restricted Share shall vest at the same times, in the same proportions
(applied pro rata) and on the same terms as the corresponding Company Option
would have vested under the terms applicable to such Company Option as of the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per Share
of any Company Option, whether vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the
occurrence of the Effective Time and without any

 



9  action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the holders thereof, the Company Option will automatically
terminate and be canceled without payment of any consideration to the holder
thereof.

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding restricted stock unit awarded pursuant to any Company Stock Plan
(collectively, the " _Restricted Stock Units_ ") shall be treated as provided
below. To the extent that a Restricted Stock Unit award is vested or, by its
terms, becomes vested as of the Effective Time, such vested portion of such
Restricted Stock Unit award shall, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, automatically become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall
lapse, and each such vested portion of such Restricted Stock Unit award shall
be canceled and converted into the right to receive an amount in cash from the
Company equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration _multiplied by_
(ii) the number of Shares subject to such vested portion of such Restricted
Stock Unit award, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding
or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with
_Section 3.06_. To the extent that a Restricted Stock Unit award, by its
terms, is not and does not become vested as of the Effective Time, such
unvested portion of such Restricted Stock Unit award shall be converted into a
right to receive, on the same terms and conditions as applied to such
unvested portion of such Restricted Stock Unit award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, an Ultimate Parent restricted stock unit award with an
aggregate number of whole Ultimate Parent Shares (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) that is equal to the number of Shares subject to such unvested
portion of such Restricted Stock Unit award immediately prior to the Effective
Time _multiplied by_ a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the
Merger Consideration and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the fair
market value of an Ultimate Parent Share at the Effective Time.

(c) Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to make payments of the
Option Payoff Amounts and Merger Consideration payable with respect to
Restricted Stock Units to all holders thereof, as applicable, as promptly as
reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, and in any event, no
later than the end of the second payroll period commencing after the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide, or cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation
sufficient funds to make such payments.

 

(d) On and after the Agreement Date, no new offering period or purchase period
shall commence under the Companys 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") and participants in the ESPP shall not be permitted to increase
their payroll deductions or purchase elections from those in effect on the
Agreement Date. The offering period and purchase period in progress as of the
Agreement Date under the ESPP will continue in accordance with its terms, and
options granted during such offering period will be exercisable in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP; _provided_ that (i) the completion of such
offering period and any existing purchase period shall occur on the earlier of
(x) the scheduled date of completion for such offering period and any such
existing purchase period and (y) such other date at or prior to
the occurrence of the Offer Closing that is deemed administratively
appropriate by the parties (the date of such completion, in the case of
clauses (x) or (y), the " _Final Purchase Date_ "), (ii) Shares shall be
issued to participants thereunder on the Final Purchase Date, such that each
option outstanding under the ESPP shall be exercised automatically on such
Final Purchase Date, and (iii) the purchase price per Share applicable to the
offering period in progress as of the Agreement Date shall not be decreased.
The Company shall, as soon as administratively

 



10  practicable on and after the Agreement Date and prior to the Final Purchase
Date, take all necessary actions under the ESPP and applicable Law (including
amending the ESPP and providing notices to participants, if applicable) to so
provide, including to avoid the commencement of, any new offering period or
purchase period thereunder after the Agreement Date and prior to the earlier
of the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time and to prevent new
participants from joining the offering period and purchase period in progress
as of the Agreement Date. Prior to providing notices to participants, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review
such notices.

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Agreement Date, and in any
event prior to the Initial Expiration Date, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans and the ESPP)
shall adopt such resolutions, provide any necessary notices to participants
and take such other actions as may be required to terminate each of
the Company Stock Plans and the ESPP effective as of the Effective Time and
to effectuate all of the actions contemplated by this _Section 3.05_,
contingent on the Closing of the Merger. Prior to providing notices to
participants, the Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity
to review such notices.

Section 3.06 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, such
amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted
and withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

Section 3.07 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, during the
period between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, the number of
outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number of Shares or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
that in any case, nothing in this _Section 3.07_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 3.08 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Shares that
are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that
are held by stockholders who are entitled to demand and are properly demanding
appraisal rights pursuant to, and who are complying in all respects with, the
provisions of Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting Shares_
") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due to the holders of
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Corporation Law, unless and
until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under Section 262 of the
Corporation Law.

 



11 (b) Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the
Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders
Shares shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the
right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that
such right to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or
expired, the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company
shall give Parent and Merger Sub (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares (or written threats thereof), withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Corporation Law and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of
Dissenting Shares, and (ii) the right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or
settle any such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree
to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.09 _Subsequent Actions_. The parties agree to take all necessary
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable
following the Offer Closing without a meeting of the Companys stockholders,
as provided in Section 251(h) of the Corporation Law. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets of
the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise to
carry out the intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments
and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or
otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable
to continue, vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest
in, to and under such rights, properties, privileges, franchises or assets in
the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the intent of this
Agreement.

corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which
the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature
of the business transacted by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except to the extent the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. _Section 4.01_
of the Disclosure Letter identifies each Subsidiary of the Company. All the
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests
in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights, and
are owned by the Company, free and clear of all Liens. The Company does not,
directly or indirectly, own any interest in any Person other than as set forth
in _Section 4.01_ of the Disclosure Letter. The Company has delivered or made
available to Parent prior to the Agreement Date accurate and complete copies
of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws and other charter and
organizational documents of each of the Company Entities, including all
amendments thereto, as in effect on the Agreement Date.

Entity is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock of the Company.

affecting the availability of specific performance and other equitable
remedies.

license, agreement, contract, indenture, Permit or other instrument or
obligation to which any Company Entity is a party or by which any Company
Entity or any of its assets may be bound, (d) result (or, with the giving of

to any Company Entity or by which any of its assets are bound, except in the
case of clauses (b) through (e), inclusive, as have not had and would not

Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.05 _Reports; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed Liabilities_.
Except as has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect:

(a) Since June 17, 2014, the Company has timely filed or furnished all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed
or furnished by it with or to the SEC pursuant to the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), all of which have complied as
of their respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing, in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and, in each case, the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder. No executive officer of the Company has failed in
any respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section
302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ")
with respect to any Company SEC Report. None of the Company SEC Reports,
including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein, at the time filed or furnished or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing of the same or different report, schedule,
form, statement or other document, as of the date of the last such amendment
or superseding filing, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

 

(b) Each of the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements
(including the related notes thereto) of the Company included
(or incorporated by reference) in the Company SEC Reports when filed (i)
complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) had been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved, and (iii) fairly presented
in all material respects the financial position of the Company as of their
respective dates, and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented therein (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements,
to normal year-end audit adjustments). No financial statements of any Person
other than the Company Entities are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the Company.

 

(c) Except to the extent reflected or reserved against in the most recent
unaudited balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto) included in the
Filed SEC Documents, the Company Entities do not have any liabilities or
obligations (whether absolute,

 



16  accrued, contingent, fixed or otherwise) of any nature, except liabilities
and obligations that (i) were incurred since the date of such balance sheet in
the ordinary course of business or (ii) were incurred under this Agreement or
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger.

 

(d) The Company has established and maintained a system of internal control
over financial reporting in accordance with applicable requirements under
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Such internal controls provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of Company financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since June 17, 2014, the Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all
known significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect any Company Entitys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and
(ii) any known fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
controls. The Company has made available to Parent all such disclosures made
by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee since June 17,
2014. To the Knowledge of the Company, as of the Agreement Date, none of the
Filed SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or outstanding SEC
investigation and there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received
from the SEC with respect to any of the Filed SEC Documents. There has been no
material correspondence between the SEC and the Company since June 17, 2014
through the Agreement Date that is not available on the SECs Electronic Data
Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) database.

 

(e) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures in accordance with applicable requirements under Rule 13a-15 under
the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that material information relating to each Company Entity
required to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act is made known
to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer and to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure and to make
certifications required to be made by the Company under applicable
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

(f) The Company does not have any "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement" that would
require disclosure under Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act.

not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a

change, event, development or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Since December 31, 2014 and through and including the Agreement Date, each
Company Entity has, in all respects, conducted its business in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, and the Company has not
taken or failed to take any action that, had such action been taken or failed
to have been taken after the Agreement Date, would have required Parents
consent under _Section 6.01(b)_, _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ , _(h)_ ,
_(i)_ , _(j)_ , _(k)_ , _(m)_ , _(n)_ , _(o)_ , _(p)_ or  _(q)_ or _Section

any Company Entity supplied or to be supplied by or on behalf of any Company
Entity for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents
will, at the time of the filing of, at the time of any amendment of or
supplement to, and at the time of any publication, distribution or
dissemination of, the Offer Documents, and at the time of the consummation of
the Offer, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. At the time of the filing of, at the time of any
amendment of or supplement to, and at the time of any

and (b) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. For clarity, the representations and
warranties in this _Section 4.07_ will not apply to statements or omissions
included or incorporated by reference in the Offer Documents or the Schedule

or any of their representatives on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub specifically
for inclusion therein.

Code either has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service or may rely upon a favorable prototype opinion letter from the
Internal Revenue Service as to its qualified status, and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, nothing has occurred since the date of the latest

Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) other than routine claims for

liability. Neither any Company Entity nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors,
maintains, participates in or contributes to, or has, within the past six (6)
years, sponsored, maintained, participated in or contributed to, a
Multiemployer Plan or other pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code. " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any entity (whether

officer or individual consultant of any Company Entity.

(g) No Company Entity is a party to, bound by, or in the process of
negotiating any labor or collective bargaining agreement with any labor union

Company, no Trade Secrets included in the Owned Company IP have been disclosed
to or used by any Person except pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement which,

each other Company Entity and its and their directors, officers and employees
not to and shall direct and cause its other Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of providing information) the submission or
announcement of any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or would
reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal, (ii) participate or
engage in any discussions or

 



38  negotiations with any Person with respect to any Takeover Proposal, (iii)
otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in any such inquiries,
proposals, offers, discussions or negotiations, or (iv) enter into any merger
agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principal, purchase agreement or
similar Contract relating to a Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall
cause each other Company Entity and its and their directors, officers and
employees to and shall direct and cause its other Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation, encouragement,
discussion or negotiation with any Person or groups that may be ongoing with
respect to any Takeover Proposal or potential Takeover Proposal. The Company
shall promptly after the Agreement Date request each Person (if any) that has
heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement) relating to a Takeover Proposal or potential
Takeover Proposal to promptly return to the Company or destroy all non-public
documents and materials relating to the Takeover Proposal or to any Company
Entity or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by the
Company or any of its Representatives to such Person or group or any of its
Representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality
agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company and its Representatives may in any event (A) seek to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal
made by such a Person or group solely to determine whether such inquiry or
proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and (B) inform a Person or group that has made or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, is considering making a Takeover Proposal of the provisions of
this  _Section 6.02_.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (i) the Company has received a bona
fide, written Takeover Proposal from any Person or group that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.02_, and (ii) the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely
to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such action
described in clause (A) or (B) below would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company
may (A) furnish information with respect to the Company Entities to the Person
or group making such Takeover Proposal;  _provided_ that (x) the Company
shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company that is provided to (or given access to) any Person or
group and which was not previously provided to Parent and (y) the Company
shall take reasonable steps to safeguard any commercially sensitive non-public
information of the Company Entities (including entering into an agreement with
such Person or group that contains provisions limiting the disclosure or use
of such information that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company
than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement), or (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover
Proposal regarding such Takeover Proposal (and waive such Persons
noncompliance with the provisions of any "standstill" agreement solely to the
extent necessary to permit such discussions or negotiations on a confidential
basis);  _provided_ that prior to or concurrently with the Company taking
such actions as described in clauses (A) and/or (B) above, the Company shall
provide written notice to Parent of such determination of the Company Board as
provided for in clause (ii) above.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify Parent orally and in writing in the event that
the Company, its directors, officers or employees or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any of its other Representatives, receives any Takeover Proposal,
and, in connection with such notice, provide 

 



39  the material terms and conditions thereof (including the identity of the
Person or group making such Takeover Proposal), and thereafter the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of any
change in the status or material terms and conditions thereof.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or
publicly propose to withdraw or rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation or the
findings or conclusions of the Company Board referred to in _Section
4.03(b)_, (ii) approve or recommend the adoption of, or publicly propose to
approve, declare the advisability of or recommend the adoption of, any
Takeover Proposal or (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys stockholders (any action
described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, subject to compliance
with the other provisions of this _Section 6.02_, (i) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (ii) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event; _provided_
that (A) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, (B) in the case of clause (i), the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) that the applicable Takeover Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (C) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent
at least three (3) Business Days prior to taking the applicable action
referred to in clause (i) or (ii) of its intent to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor (a " _Notice of Intended Recommendation
Change_ ") and (D) prior to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change the
Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent
in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) during such three
(3) Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would obviate the basis for an Adverse Recommendation
Change. Any material change to the financial terms (including any change to
the amount or form of consideration payable) or other material revisions in
connection with an applicable Takeover Proposal shall require a new Notice
of Intended Recommendation Change and an additional period of two (2)
Business Days (instead of three (3) Business Days).

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, or otherwise violate its obligations under applicable
Law; _provided_ that no Adverse Recommendation Change may be made unless the
Company shall have first complied with its obligations in _Section 6.02(e)_.

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any
proposal or offer from any Person or group providing for (A) any direct or
indirect acquisition, purchase or license, in a single transaction or

 



40  a series of related transactions, of (1) 20% or more of the assets
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property) of the Company
Entities, taken as a whole, or (2) Shares or any other Company Securities,
which together with any other Shares or other Company Securities beneficially
owned by such Person or group, would represent 20% or more of the outstanding
Shares, (B) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any Person or group owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of
the outstanding Shares, (C) any merger, consolidation, business combination,
share exchange or similar transaction involving any Company Entity pursuant
to which any Person or group (or the shareholders of any Person) would own,
directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the
Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or
indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or 20% or more of the
assets (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property) of the
Company Entities, taken as a whole, or (D) any reorganization,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, liquidation, dissolution or any
other similar transaction involving any Company Entity, other than, in each
case, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide, written Takeover Proposal (except that all
references to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%" for this
purpose) received after the Agreement Date which the Company Board determines
in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel) (x) is reasonably capable of being consummated in accordance
with its terms without undue delay and for which financing, if a cash
transaction (whether in whole or in part), is reasonably determined by the
Company Board to be available, and (y) if consummated, would be more favorable
to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
Offer and the Merger, in each case taking into account all relevant factors
(including all the terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal and of this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent pursuant to _Section 6.02(e)_)).

 

Section 6.03 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From and after the Agreement Date, subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, the Company will give Parent and Merger Sub and
their authorized officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice) to such personnel, properties, businesses, operations,
books and records of the Company Entities at reasonable times as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request, including to observe one or more
manufacturing runs of the Key Product. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be obligated to provide such access to the extent that to
do so (i) could reasonably be expected to jeopardize an attorney-client
privilege or attorney work product protection, or (ii) would violate an
existing confidentiality obligation to any Person; _provided_ that the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents
to provide such access and take such other action (such as the redaction of
identifying or confidential information, entry into a joint defense agreement
or other agreement or by providing such access, inspections, data or other
information solely to outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney client
privilege) as is necessary to provide such access to Parent and Merger Sub in
compliance with applicable Law, and otherwise the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to institute appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements, to the extent practicable in the circumstances.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and provided that
the Company will have final authority over the form and content of all
submissions to and communications with the FDA and any similar foreign
Governmental Entity, the Company shall,

 



41  subject to its compliance with any confidentiality obligations to third
parties, (i) promptly notify Parent in writing of any significant data
relating to the safety or effectiveness of the Companys product known as
ZS-9 (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) (the " _Key Product_ ") or the
manufacture thereof (including process development or scale-up activities and
FDA or similar Governmental Entity inspection findings), (ii) reasonably
consult with Parent in connection with any proposed meeting with the FDA
relating to the Key Product, (iii) promptly inform Parent of, and provide
Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review, any material
filing, correspondence, or substantive communication proposed to be submitted
to the FDA and any similar foreign Governmental Entity relating to the Key
Product, (iv) promptly inform Parent of any material oral or written
substantive communication from or to the FDA and any similar foreign
Governmental Entity relating to the Key Product, (v) promptly inform Parent
of, and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on, any
material change to the Key Product that would reasonably be expected to
affect its regulatory approval status, and (vi) consider in good faith and, to
the extent reasonable to do so, incorporate any comments or other input
provided by Parent in respect of the foregoing.

 

(c) All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this _Section
6.03_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.04 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and
subject to the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall file as promptly as practicable, and
in any event no later than within five (5) Business Days of the Agreement
Date, any required submissions under the HSR Act, and use its reasonable best
efforts (A) to furnish information required in connection with such
submissions under the HSR Act (including responding to any "second request"
for additional information or documentary material under the HSR Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable), (B) to obtain early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, (C) to keep the other parties reasonably
informed with respect to the status of any such submissions under the HSR Act,
including with respect to: (1) the receipt of any non-action, action,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the expiration of any waiting
period, (3) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any
investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding
under Competition Laws and (4) the nature and status of any objections raised
or proposed or threatened to be raised under Competition Laws with respect to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (D) to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, clearances and approvals from any Governmental Entity and (ii) the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with one another: (A)
in promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be
made or any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be
obtained from other parties to loan agreements or other Contracts or
instruments that the Company is a party to or related to the Companys
business in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain
timely any such consents, permits, approvals or waivers.

 



42 (b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in  _Section 6.04(a)_ above: (i) promptly notify the others of,
and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the others of the contents of) any substantive
communication to such Person from a Governmental Entity and permit the others
to review and discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments
made by the others in relation to) any proposed written substantive
communication to a Governmental Entity concerning the Offer or the Merger and
(ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any developments, requests for
meetings or discussions with any Governmental Entity, in each case in respect
of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the Offer or the Merger.
Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 6.04(c)_ below, Parent shall have
the right to control, lead, determine and direct the strategy and process by
which the Parties shall seek required consents, approvals, clearances,
waivers, waiting period expirations and terminations and removal of all
impediments (including all elements of any proceeding or litigation and
communications with any Governmental Entity), in each case under Competition
Laws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall
consult with the Company and consider in good faith the views of the Company
prior to proposing, negotiating, or entering into any agreement, undertaking
or understanding (whether oral or written) with any Governmental Entity
relating to any Competition Laws, provided that the final determination as to
the appropriate course of action shall be made by Parent. In the event that
Parent and the Company do not agree with respect to any matter in connection
with seeking required approvals relating to Competition Laws, subject to and
without limiting in any respect the Parties obligations in this _Section
6.04_, Parents decision will control. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agree not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
proposed transaction unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of  _Section 1.01(d)_ and _Section 1.02(a)_, not this _Section 6.04(b)_,
shall govern the matters covered therein.

 

(c) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action is commenced challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order that may result from such litigation, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests. Each party hereto shall keep the other
parties hereto reasonably informed, but only to the extent that doing so would
not, in the reasonable judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege
of the party with respect thereto regarding any such litigation, action or
proceeding, it being agreed that each party will also cooperate with the other
parties to permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a
basis that does not compromise or waive such privilege with respect thereto.
The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent (and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to cooperate
with Parent) in connection with, and shall consult with and permit Parent and
its representatives to actively participate in) the defense of any such
litigation, action or proceeding and will use reasonable best efforts to
reflect and incorporate any advice or other input of Parent with respect to
such litigation, action or

 



43  proceeding. The Company shall not be allowed to settle or enter into any
negotiations or settlement of any such litigation, action or proceeding
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the provisions of _Section 6.04(b)_ shall apply with respect to any
litigations, actions, proceedings and other matters relating to Competition
Laws as provided therein in lieu of the provisions of this _Section 6.04(c)_
in the event of any conflict therewith.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall,
and shall cause its controlled Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Competition Law so as
to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby to occur as
soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside
Date), including but not limited to (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to
and effecting, by consent decree, a hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product, groups or assets of
Parent or its controlled Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and
its Affiliates) and (ii) taking or committing to take actions that after the
Closing Date would limit Parents or its controlled Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporations and its Affiliates), freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, products, groups
or assets of Parent and its controlled Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates), and to otherwise avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent injunction which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Mergers and the Purchase, and in that
regard Parent shall and, shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates) to, agree to divest, sell, dispose
of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
its freedom of action with respect to Parents or its controlled Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporations and its Affiliates), ability to
retain, any of the businesses, products, groups or assets of Parent or any of
its controlled Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its
Affiliates); _provided_ that the Parent Parties and their controlled
Affiliates shall not be required pursuant to this _Section 6.04(d)_ to take
any action that would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
effect on Parent and its controlled Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates), considered as a whole (any such action
described in this proviso, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

(e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall either party permit
its Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets (except
in each case pursuant to any agreement in effect on the Agreement Date), if
the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation
of such acquisition, would reasonably be expected to materially increase the
risk of not obtaining the applicable consent, clearance, approval,
authorization or waiver under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent
and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of The
NASDAQ Global Market to cause the delisting of the Shares from The NASDAQ
Global Market by the Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after such delisting. 

 



44 Section 6.05 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors and officers of the Company (each an " _Indemnified Person_
") as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or
under any agreement in favor of any such director as in effect as of
the Agreement Date in the form made available to Parent prior to the
Agreement Date with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the Effective
Time shall survive the Offer Closing and the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each such
Indemnified Person in respect of all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such to the extent provided in such Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws or agreement for not less than six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause
to be maintained in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective
Time, policies of directors and officers liability insurance (which may
take the form of an extended reporting period, endorsement or policy) covering
the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance policies in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Companys policies existing on the Agreement Date; _provided_
that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the
annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year
for such insurance; _provided_ _further_ that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, if and to the extent available
commercially, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may purchase, in lieu of the
insurance contemplated by the preceding sentence, a six-year "tail" prepaid
policy on the directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms
and conditions no less favorable than the directors and officers liability
insurance policies in effect on the Agreement Date; _provided_ that the
maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies for any such
year shall not be in excess of the maximum aggregate annual premium
contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person
notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time that a Legal Proceeding (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) has been commenced against such Indemnified Person
in respect of which such Person expects to seek indemnification pursuant to
this  _Section 6.05_, the provisions of this _Section 6.05_ shall continue
in effect with respect to such Legal Proceeding until the final disposition of
such Legal Proceeding.

 

(d) This _Section 6.05_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs and legal representatives and are in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. From and after the
Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.05_ may not be amended in a
manner adverse to any Indemnified Person without his or her prior consent.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section 6.05_.

 



45 Section 6.06 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and
fulfill all of the Plans listed on _Section 4.09(a)_ of the Disclosure
Letter in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Agreement Date or as subsequently amended in accordance with their terms,
including pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of at least twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the
applicable Continuing Employee), it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) provide the employees of the Company who continue as of
the Effective Time to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with at least the
same level of base salary or hourly wage rate, as the case may be, and annual
cash incentive compensation targets (excluding equity compensation) that
were provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide the Continuing Employee with "employee welfare
benefits" (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) and "employee
pension benefits" (within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA) (excluding
equity compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, provide severance payments and benefits to each
Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated without cause, on or before
the first (1st) anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
that are consistent with the severance payments and benefits that would have
been paid or provided under the terms and conditions of the Company severance
plan set forth in  _Section 6.06(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual (solely for
the purposes of determining accrual of vacation and paid time off) under the
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Parent Benefit
Plans_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
service rendered by each Continuing Employee to the Company prior to the
Effective Time to be credited for all purposes (other than for purposes of
determining an accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan) to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plan; _provided_ that in
no event shall Continuing Employees be entitled to service credit to the
extent such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits for the
same period of service.

 

(d) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately

 



46  eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all Parent
Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent Benefit Plan replaces
coverage under a comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time; and (ii) for purposes of
each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Continuing Employee from and after the Effective Time,
(A) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or actively-at-
work requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable Plan and (B)
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or cause to be
recognized, any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his
or her covered dependents under a Plan during the portion of the plan year
prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such Parent
Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-
payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit Plan.

(e) Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, pay each Continuing Employees a bonus under the
annual bonus program(s) identified in _Section 6.06(e)_ of the Disclosure
Letter that are applicable to such Continuing Employee for the fiscal year in
which the Effective Time occurs, and (i) if the Closing Date occurs on or
prior to December 31, 2015, such bonus shall be the full bonus payable for the
2015 fiscal year calculated based on the assumption that all performance
goals for the 2015 fiscal year have been achieved at their target levels and
the Closing had occurred on December 31, 2015 and (ii) if the Closing Date
occurs after December 31, 2015, such bonus payable by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be calculated based upon the assumption that all performance
goals for the Companys 2016 fiscal year have been achieved at their target
levels and prorated based on the number of days that have elapsed in
such fiscal year as of the Closing Date and, subject to _Section
6.06(b)(i)_, each such Continuing Employee shall be eligible to participate in
a bonus program of Parent or one of its Affiliates for the balance of the
fiscal year of Parent in effect on the Closing Date. In addition, Parent
acknowledges and agrees that (A) if the Closing Date occurs after December 31,
2015, the Company shall pay the bonus with respect to the 2015 fiscal year by
no later than December 31, 2015 and such bonus may be calculated on the basis
described in clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence and (B)
irrespective of when the Closing Date occurs, the Company may determine that
certain Company employees may receive a bonus in excess of the target level
with respect to the Companys 2015 fiscal year and/or in excess of the pro
rata bonus amount described in clause (ii) of the immediately preceding
sentence (but not greater in the aggregate than twice a full years bonus
calculated based on performance at target levels) for the 2016 fiscal year, in
either case, as further set forth in _Section 6.06(e)_ of the Disclosure
Letter.

 

(f) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan(s)_ "),
effective not later than the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective
Time. In the event that Parent requests that the Company 401(k) Plan(s) be
terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such
Company 401(k) Plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to a resolution of the
Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than two (2) Business
Days immediately

 



47  preceding the Effective Time, and (ii) the Company and Parent shall take any
and all action as may be required, including amendments to the Company 401(k)
Plan(s) and/or the tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan
designated by Parent (the " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") to permit each Continuing
Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, including of loans) in
cash or notes (in the case of loans) in an amount equal to the eligible
rollover distribution portion of the account balance distributable to such
Continuing Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan(s) to the Parent 401(k) Plan
upon receipt of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service on termination for the Company 401(k) Plan(s).

 

(g) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.06_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto,
and that nothing in this _Section 6.06_, whether express or implied, (i)
shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other
Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan.

Section 6.07 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Offer or the Merger,
including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the Company Board,
as applicable, shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and otherwise act to
eliminate the effects of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse
Recommendation Change shall change the approval of the Company Board for
purposes of causing any Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.08 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any
litigation related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby is brought by any stockholder or other holder
of any Company Securities (whether directly or on behalf of the Company or
otherwise) against any Company Entity and/or its directors, officers or
representatives, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation
and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense
of any such litigation, and the Company shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such litigation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company shall not settle or enter into any
negotiations for the settlement of any such litigation without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 

Section 6.09 _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or 

 



48  announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable U.S. or non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental
body to which the relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the
party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood that
the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the extent
so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party. The
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore
agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) to the extent the content of any
press release or other announcement has been approved and made in accordance
with this _Section 6.09_, no separate approval shall be required in respect
of such content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent
press release or other announcement, and (b) each party may, without
complying with the foregoing obligations, make any public statement regarding
the transactions contemplated hereby in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal
announcements to employees, to the extent that such statements are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this 
_Section 6.09_ and do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.09_ shall not apply
to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with and related to an Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as
any public statement in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change is
made in compliance with  _Section 6.02_ or with any release or announcement
made or proposed to be made by Parent in connection with any such release or
announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company.

 

Section 6.10 _Repayment of Credit Facility_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Company will cause all Obligations (as defined in the
Credit and Security Agreement, by and among the Company, as borrower, MidCap
Financial SBIC, LP, as administrative agent, and the lenders listed on the
Credit Facility Schedule attached thereto and otherwise party thereto from
time to time, dated as of July 14, 2014 (as amended from time to time, the "
_Credit Agreement_ ")) outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be paid in
full.

 

Section 6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 6.12 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not, from and after the Agreement Date and until
the Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or
former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company, unless prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or
modification, the compensation committee of the Company Board (each member of
which the Company Board determined is an "independent director" within the
meaning of the applicable NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director"
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2)

 



49  under the Exchange Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all
such steps as may reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment
Compensation Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement
and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.12_
shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of (a) any written notice or other
communication received by such party from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Offer or the
Merger, if the failure to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to
be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
materially affect the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, (b) any Legal
Proceedings commenced or, to such partys Knowledge, threatened against,
any Company Entity or Parent or any of Parents Subsidiaries, that purport to
materially impede or delay the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or
that make allegations that, if true, would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (c) (i) in
the case of the Company, the Knowledge by the Company of any breach of or
inaccuracy in its representations or warranties set forth herein or failure to
perform its covenants or agreements set forth herein to the extent such
inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform would give rise to the failure of any
Offer Condition set forth in clauses (iv) or (v) of paragraph (c) of _Annex
I,_ or (ii) in the case of Parent, the Knowledge by Parent of any breach of
or inaccuracy in the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth herein or failure to perform the covenants or agreements of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth herein to the extent such inaccuracy, breach or failure
to perform would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall not cure any breach
of any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice; and provided, further, that the
failure to deliver such notice shall not, in and of itself, give rise to an
incremental breach for purposes of Section 8.01 or clauses (iv) or (v) of
paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ , separate and apart from the relevant underlying
inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform giving rise to the requirement to
deliver the notice.

 

ARTICLE VII

CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER

Section 7.01 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation To Effect the Merger_.
The respective obligations of the parties to effect the Merger shall be
subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver by each of the parties at or prior to the Effective Time of the
following conditions:

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

 

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (with
any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if prior to the Acceptance Time any court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, injunction or decree, or taken any other action, in each case the
effect of which is to make illegal or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and such order, injunction, decree or other action shall
have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall have
complied with its obligations under _Section 6.04_ to contest, appeal and
remove such order, injunction, decree or action; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate under this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall
not be available to any party whose material breach of its obligations
hereunder has been a principal cause of such order, injunction, decree or
action;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if (i) the Offer shall have expired (and
not been extended) or been terminated in accordance with its terms, and in
each case the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred within three (3)
Business Days thereafter or (ii) the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred
on or before April 5, 2016 (such date, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_
that the right to terminate under this _Section 8.01(c)_ shall not be
available to any party whose material breach of its obligations hereunder has
been a principal cause of the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or
before the Outside Date;

 

(d) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall be any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Companys representations or warranties
set forth herein or the Company has failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth herein, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
(i) would give rise to the failure of any Offer Condition set forth in
clauses (iv) or (v) of paragraph (c) of _Annex I_ , and (ii) (A) is not
capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) is not cured within
twenty (20) Business Days following Parents delivery of written notice to
the Company of such breach or failure to perform; _provided_ that Parent shall
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(d)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder such that the
Company has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(e)_;

 

(e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall
be any breach or inaccuracy in any of Parents or Merger Subs
representations or warranties set forth herein or Parent or Merger Sub has
failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set

 



51  forth herein, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform (i) would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially delay the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), and (ii) (A) is not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date
or (B) is not cured within twenty (20) Business Days following the Companys
delivery of written notice to Parent of such breach or failure to perform;
_provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_ if the Company is then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder such that Parent has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_;

 

(f) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in the event that
either of the following shall have occurred: (i) an Adverse Recommendation
Change; (ii) a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company
shall have been commenced and the Company shall not have publicly announced,
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer, and the Company shall not have issued a press release that
expressly reaffirms the Company Recommendation within such ten (10) Business
Day period; or (iii) the Company shall have intentionally and materially
breached its obligations under _Section 6.02_; or

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company
Board is permitted to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.02(e)_, in order to enter
into an acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement
providing for such Superior Proposal immediately following or concurrently
with such termination; _provided_ that (x) such Superior Proposal did not
result from a breach of  _Section 6.02_ and (y) concurrent payment of the
Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be a condition to the right of the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(g)_.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any of the
foregoing clauses (b) through (g), inclusive, of this _Section 8.01_ shall
give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance with
_Section 9.05_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to
which such termination is effected.

 

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
Offer and the Merger are abandoned pursuant to  _Section 8.01_, this
Agreement, except for the provisions of the last sentence of _Section
1.02(b)_, _Section 6.03(c)_, this _Section 8.02_, _Section 8.03_ and
_Article IX_ , shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party or any of its respective directors,
officers, stockholders, employees, agents, consultants or representatives.
Nothing in this Agreement (including  _Section 8.03(c)_) shall relieve any
party to this Agreement of liability for fraud or any Willful Breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Willful Breach_ " means an intentional and willful material breach, or an
intentional and willful material failure to perform, in each case that is the
consequence of an act or omission by a party with the actual knowledge that
the taking of such act or failure to take such act would cause a breach of
this Agreement.

 



52 Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses.

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent the Fee if this Agreement is terminated
as follows:

(i) if (i) after the Agreement Date, a Takeover Proposal shall have become
publicly known and not publicly withdrawn prior to such termination, (ii)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 8.01(c)_ solely as a result of a failure to satisfy the Minimum
Condition, or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)_ due to a Willful
Breach by the Company, and (iii) within twelve (12) months of such
termination, the Company Board recommends to the Companys stockholders any
Takeover Proposal that is subsequently consummated or the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries enters into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
other definitive agreement that provides for a Takeover Proposal that is
subsequently consummated, or a Takeover Proposal is consummated, then, in any
such case, the Company shall pay to Parent (or a person designated by Parent
in writing) the Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2)
Business Days of the date such transaction is consummated. Solely for purposes
of this _Section 8.03(b)(i)_, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in  _Section 6.02(g)_, except that all
references to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%";

 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.01(f)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent the Fee by wire transfer of same-day
funds within two (2) Business Days following the date of such termination of
this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition to the
effectiveness of) such termination.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Fee shall be payable only once and not in duplication
even though the Fee may be payable under one or more provisions hereof.
Subject to _Section 8.02_, in the event Parent shall receive the Fee, the
receipt thereof shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (and
the termination thereof or any matter forming the basis for such termination),
and in such case neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be entitled
to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding against the Company or any of
its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for

 



53  such termination. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Fee when due and
payable pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences an action or other proceeding that results in an
award against the Company for such Fee, the Company shall pay Parents costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such action or proceeding, together with interest on the amount of the
Fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of
payment at the prime lending rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

 

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that following the Offer Closing, this
Agreement may not be amended in any manner that causes the Merger
Consideration to differ from the Offer Price. This Agreement may not be
amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 8.05  _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by
any other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing
delivered pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (c) waive
compliance by any party with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf
of such party. The failure or delay of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights, powers or privileges under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, powers or privileges.

 

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 9.01 _Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any schedule,
instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Effective Time. This _Section 9.01_ shall not limit any covenant
or agreement of the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after
the Effective Time.

Section 9.02 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the annexes and exhibits hereto or thereto, the
Disclosure Letter and the other documents and certificates delivered pursuant
hereto, constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement except that the standstill restrictions in the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate immediately upon the execution and
delivery of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
(including by operation of law, by merger or otherwise), in whole or in part,
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any such assignment
without consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that Parent or Merger Sub
may assign any of their respective rights and obligations to any direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent
or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of its obligations hereunder.

 



54 Section 9.03 _Enforcement of the Agreement_. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, without proof of
actual damages or inadequacy of legal remedy and without bond or other
security being required. Except as otherwise provided herein, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, _Section 8.03_, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereby agree not to raise any
objections to the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance
to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by
any party, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.04 _Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, solely if
such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court
sitting in New Castle County in the State of Delaware, with respect to any
dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or
any transaction contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (iii) agrees
that it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in
connection with this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, in any court other than any
such court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection
to the laying of venue of any Legal Proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in the chancery courts of the State of
Delaware or in any Federal court located in the State of Delaware, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim
in any such court that any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in _Section 9.05_
shall be effective service of process for any proceeding arising out
of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES

OUT OF, RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING THE OFFER AND THE MERGER. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATION OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

 _Offer Conditions_

 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Offer and in addition to Merger
Subs rights to extend, amend or terminate the Offer in accordance with the
provisions of the Agreement and applicable Law, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act, pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, if:

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares (excluding shares tendered
pursuant to notices of guaranteed delivery for which Shares have not been
delivered) that, when added to the Shares then owned by Parent and its
Subsidiaries, would represent one share more than one half of all Shares
outstanding as of the Acceptance Time (such condition in this clause (a), the
" _Minimum Condition_ ");

 

(b) any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the Offer
under the HSR Act shall not have expired or been terminated prior to the
Acceptance Time (or shall have expired or been terminated subject to the
imposition of a Burdensome Condition); or

(c) any of the following events shall exist and be continuing:

(i) there shall be any Law or order, injunction or decree enacted, enforced,
amended, issued, in effect or deemed applicable to the Offer, by any
Governmental Entity (other than the application of the waiting period
provisions of the HSR Act to the Offer or to the Merger) that is in effect, or
any Governmental Entity shall have taken any other action, in each case the
effect of which is to make illegal or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Offer or the Merger or to impose any Burdensome Condition;

 

(ii) there shall exist or be instituted or pending any claim, suit, action or
proceeding by any Governmental Entity seeking to impose any Burdensome
Condition;

(iii) the Company and Parent shall have reached an agreement that the Offer or
the Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms;

(iv) (A) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.02(a)_ (Capitalization) and _Section 4.21_ (Financial Advisory)
of the Agreement shall not be true and correct as of the Agreement Date and as
of the Acceptance Time as though made on and as of such date (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date) except for any inaccuracies that are _de minimis_ in both amount and
nature, (B) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Section 4.01_ (Organization), _Section 4.02_ (Capitalization), _Section
4.03_ (Authority), _Section 4.08_ (Brokers), _Section 4.22_ (Takeover
Statute), and _Section 4.23_ (Rule 14d-10) that are qualified as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect shall not be true and correct in all
respects, and any such

 



I-1  representations or warranties that are not so qualified shall not be true
and correct in any material respect, in each case as of the Agreement Date and
as of the Acceptance Time as though made on and as of such date (except to
the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
earlier date), (C) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth
in _Section 4.06(a)_ (Absence of Changes) shall not be true and correct in
all respects and (D) any other representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in the Agreement shall not be true and correct (without giving
effect to any limitation on any representation or warranty indicated by the
words "Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects," "in any material
respect," "material," "materially" or words of similar import set forth
therein) as of the Agreement Date and as of the Acceptance Time as though
made on and as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the case of
this clause (D), where the failure of any such representations and warranties
to be so true and correct has not had and would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

 

(v) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply with in any material
respect any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed or
complied with by it under the Agreement at or prior to the Acceptance Time and
such failure shall not have been cured on or prior to the Acceptance Time;

 

(vi) after the Agreement Date, there shall have occurred and be continuing a
Material Adverse Effect (or any fact, condition, change, development or event
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect);

 

(vii) Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company,
executed by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the
Company, dated as of the date on which the Acceptance Time occurs, to the
effect that the conditions set forth in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) of this
paragraph (c) have not occurred; or

 

(viii) the Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) under the Credit
Agreement shall not have been paid in full.

 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to any such conditions, and may be waived by Parent or Merger Sub
in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole and
absolute discretion (except for the Minimum Condition), in each case, subject
to the terms of the Agreement and the applicable rules and regulations of the
SEC. The failure or delay by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any
of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and
each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any
time and from time to time.

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex I_ and not defined in this _Annex
I_ shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of November 5, 2015, by and among Zeneca, Inc., Zanzibar Acquisition
Corp. and ZS Pharma, Inc. (the " _Agreement_ ").
