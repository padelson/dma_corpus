the DLLCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the
Partnership (the " _Merger_ "), the separate existence of Merger Sub will

those conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Partnership
and Parent shall agree. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

merger, executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Partnership
Agreement, the DRULPA and the DLLCA (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), to be
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger
will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later

specified in the Certificate of Merger (the effective time of the Merger being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE III __

 

 _MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES_

 

Section 3.1 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Partnership, the Partnership GP
or any holder of Parent securities or Partnership securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Units_. Subject to _Section 3.1(c)_ , _Section
3.2(h)_ and _Section 3.3_ , each Common Unit issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive 0.985 of a Parent Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ " and such
ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), which such Parent Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable in accordance with
applicable Laws, subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 3.3_.

 



11 (b) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The limited liability company interests in
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into a number of Common Units of the Surviving Entity equal
to the number of Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ , and Parent (which will be the
sole member of Merger Sub or another designated Affiliate of Parent) shall be
admitted as, or continue as, a limited partner of the Partnership (as the
Surviving Entity). At the Effective Time, the books and records of the
Partnership shall be revised to reflect the conversion of all Common Units
held by Persons other than the Partnership GP, Parent and any Subsidiaries of
Parent, and the Partnership (as the Surviving Entity) shall continue without
dissolution.

(c) _Treatment of Partnership Owned Units and Parent Owned Partnership
Interests_.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
the Effective Time, all Common Units that are owned immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Partnership shall be automatically canceled and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
canceled Common Units. 

(ii) All Partnership Interests, including any (i) General Partner
Percentage Interests (which includes the Incentive Distribution Rights), (ii)
Class B Units, (iii) Common Units, (iv) all Common Units that are owned by
Subsidiaries of the Partnership, and (v) other Limited Partner Interests (as
defined in the Partnership Agreement), that are owned immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Partnership GP, Parent or any Subsidiaries of Parent
and not cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.1(c)(i)_ shall, in each case, remain
outstanding as partnership interests in the Surviving Entity, unaffected by
the Merger.

(d) _Certificates_. __ As of the Effective Time, all Common
Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Units (a
" _Certificate_ ") or non-certificated Common Units represented in book-entry
form immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Book-Entry Units_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
3.2(h)_ , in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Unit in accordance with _Section
3.2(c)_ , without interest.

 

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. __ Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint
an exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Partnership (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and Book-Entry Units for
the Merger Consideration and paying any dividends or other distributions to
which a holder of Common Units is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ and
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares to which such holder is entitled

 



12  pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of record of Common Units as of the Effective Time whose Common Units
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that, with respect to certificated Common
Units, the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_ ) to the Exchange Agent) in such
customary forms as the Partnership and Parent may reasonably
agree, including, as applicable, instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_ ) and Book-Entry Units to the Exchange Agent in
exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends or distributions
pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 

(b) _Deposit_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of
Common Units whose Common Units are converting into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, Parent Shares (which shares shall
be uncertificated and registered in book-entry form), payable upon due
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant
to _Section 3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or Book-Entry
Units pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. Following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from
time to time as needed, cash or other consideration as applicable sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ and
any Parent Shares or cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 3.2(h)_ , in each case, that may be payable from time to time
following the Effective Time. All Parent Shares and cash or other
consideration payable in respect of any dividends or distributions pursuant
to _Section 3.2(g)_ deposited with the Exchange Agent or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares as such holders have the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 3.2(h)_ shall be referred to in this Agreement as the " _Exchange
Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions
delivered by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article
III_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to pay such Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 

(c) _Exchang_ _e_. Each holder of Common Units that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section
3.2(i)_ with respect to certificated Common Units) or Book-Entry Units and
such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent
(including with respect to Book-Entry Units), will be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (i) the number of Parent Shares representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of Parent Shares that such holder has the right to
receive in accordance with the provisions of this _Article III_ , and (ii) a
check in the amount of (A) the cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and (B) such dividends or other distributions as
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_. Any and all
Parent Shares delivered in accordance with this _Section 3.2(c)_ shall be
uncertificated and shall be registered in book-entry form. The Merger
Consideration and such other amounts as

 



13  reflected in the immediately preceding sentence shall be paid as promptly as
practicable by mail after receipt by the Exchange Agent of the Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(i)_ with respect
to certificated Common Units) or any applicable documentation with respect to
the surrender of Book-Entry Units, and letter of transmittal in accordance
with the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Units.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate and Book-Entry Unit shall,
after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration and such other amounts as contemplated by
_Section 3.2(g)_ and _Section 3.2(h)_.

 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-
Entry Unit is registered, it shall be a condition of such payment that the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the making of such cash payment to a Person other than
the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be registered in the name of a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it shall
be a condition to the registration thereof that the surrendered Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required as a result
of such registration in the name of a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate, or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall
be no further registration on the books of the Partnership of transfers of
Common Units converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Units representing Common Units converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Units, except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Units are presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this _Article III_. 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Common Units converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration nine (9) months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged his, her or its Common Units for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration, the payment of cash
in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_  and
the payment of any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section
3.2(g)_ in respect of such holders Common Units. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, the Partnership and the Partnership GP shall
not be liable to any holder of Common Units for any Merger Consideration or
other amount duly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property Laws. Any Merger

 



14  Consideration and other amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Common
Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Shares issued in the Merger shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Units until such
Certificates or Book-Entry Units are surrendered as provided in this _Section
3.2_. Following such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or
other applicable Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record
holder of the Parent Shares, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the
time of such surrender, all dividends and other distributions payable in
respect of any such Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
and a payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not
previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or
other distributions payable with respect to such Parent Shares with a record
date after the Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
Parent Shares, all Parent Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be
entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

 

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractions of a Parent Share will be issued
upon the surrender of Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_ , and such fractional
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as
a holder of any Parent Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Common Units converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into account all
Common Units exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest and rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal
to the product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and
(ii) the fraction of a Parent Share that such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Article III_. As promptly as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that payment of such
cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional Parent Shares was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Shares. 

(i) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Common Units represented by
such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article III_ and pay cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 3.2(h)_ and any dividends
and other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



15 (j) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity and the
Exchange Agent shall deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts, if any, as are required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of applicable
state, local or foreign tax Law (and to the extent deduction and withholding
is required, such deduction and withholding shall be taken in cash or Parent
Common Stock, as determined by Parent). To the extent amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of the Common Units in respect of whom such withholding was
made. If withholding is taken in Parent Shares, Parent and the Exchange Agent
shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an amount of cash
equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the time of such
deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

 

Section 3.3 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article
III_ to the contrary, if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the number of outstanding Common Units or Parent Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of units or shares or a different class or
series by reason of any unit or share dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up, unit or share
distribution, combination, exchange of units or shares or similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration and any other similar dependent item, as the case
may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such
unit or share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, split-up, unit or share distribution, combination, exchange of units or
shares or similar transaction and to provide the holders of Common Units the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.3_ shall be deemed to
permit or authorize any party hereto to affect any such change that it is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to undertake pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 3.4 _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights
shall be available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.5 _Partnership SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls_.

 

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all
reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration,
proxy and other statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the
SEC since December 31, 2013 (collectively and together with all documents
filed or publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each
case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated
by reference therein, the " _Partnership SEC Documents_ "). The Partnership
SEC Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case
of Partnership SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant
to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective

 



20  SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Partnership SEC Documents), or,
if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_
"), as the case may be, applicable to such Partnership SEC Documents, and none
of the Partnership SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Partnership included in
the Partnership SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of
the date of the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated
in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the
Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-
end audit adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in
the aggregate, material to the Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole).

(c) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance
sheet of the Partnership and its consolidated Subsidiaries (including the
notes thereto) included in the Partnership SEC Documents filed by the
Partnership and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)
for liabilities and obligations incurred since December 31, 2015 (the "
_Balance Sheet Date_ ") in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, neither the Partnership nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether
or not accrued or contingent), that would be required to be reflected or
reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership prepared
in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) No Partnership Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other
documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding
comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Partnership SEC Documents. No enforcement action has been
initiated against the Partnership relating to disclosures contained or
omitted from any Partnership SEC Document.

(e) The Partnership makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has
devised and maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, in all
material respects, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange
Act. The Partnership has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms
are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the
applicable listing 

 



21  standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Partnership in the reports that it files under the Exchange
Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material
information is accumulated and communicated to its management as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Partnership GPs
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have
disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the Partnerships
auditors and the audit committee of the GP Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect the Partnerships ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Partnerships auditors any
material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Partnerships internal controls.

(f) Since January 1, 2015, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Partnership GP have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its
officers have received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certification. As of the date of this Agreement, and except as
disclosed in a Partnership SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date
of this Agreement, none of such entities has any knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over
financial reporting.

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Balance
Sheet Date, there has not occurred any change, effect, event or occurrence
that, individually or in the aggregate, has resulted, or would reasonably be
likely to result, in a Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings pending or, to
the knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in writing with respect to the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in writing with respect to any of
their respective properties or assets at law or in equity before any
Governmental Authority, and there are no orders, judgments, decrees or similar
rulings of any Governmental Authority against the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case except for those that have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8 _Compliance With Laws_.

(a) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December
31, 2013 and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or
organization have been, in compliance with and are not in default under or in
violation of any applicable federal, state, local or foreign or provincial
law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction,
decree or agency requirement of or undertaking to any Governmental Authority,
including common law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except
where such non-compliance, default or violation has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect.

 



22 (b) The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are in possession of
all franchises, tariffs, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits,
easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals and orders
of any Governmental Authority (" _Permits_ ") necessary for the Partnership
and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or
to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively,
the " _Partnership Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the
Partnership Permits has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. All
Partnership Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to
be in full force and effect has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Partnership Permits is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Partnership, threatened in writing,
except where such suspension or cancellation has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The Partnership and its Subsidiaries are
not, and since December 31, 2013 have not been, in violation or breach of, or
default under, any Partnership Permit, except where such violation, breach or
default has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event or condition has occurred or exists which would
result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any Partnership Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an applicable
Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend, any
Partnership Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time
or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Partnership Material Adverse Effect. The
Partnership Permits will not be subject to suspension, modification,
revocation or non-renewal as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except,
in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Partnership Material Adverse Effect. No Proceeding is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Partnership, threatened with respect to any alleged failure
by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to have any material
Permit necessary for the operation of any asset or the conduct of their
businesses or to be in compliance therewith, except, in each case, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Partnership Material Adverse
Effect.

 

Section 4.9 _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section
5.9_ , none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or
on behalf of the Partnership and the Partnership GP specifically for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in (a) the registration statement on Form S-4
to be filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent
Shares in connection with the Merger (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the " _Registration Statement_ ") will, at the time the Registration
Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is filed with the SEC or at

made, not misleading. The Joint Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

Contract or Parent Permit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound or affected or (iii) result in the exercisability of any right to

Section 5.5 _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal
Controls_.

 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed or furnished all reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements required to be filed or furnished by them with the SEC since
December 31, 2013 (collectively and together with all documents filed or
publicly furnished on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in each
case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents incorporated
by reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). The Parent SEC
Documents, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of the Parent
SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing
dates (in the case of all other Parent SEC Documents), or, if amended, as
finally amended prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent SEC
Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective dates
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent
SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of the
last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments,
none of which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

sheet of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries (including the notes

available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii)

 



32  for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (iii) for
liabilities and obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that
would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated
balance sheet of Parent prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto,
other than as have not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) No Parent Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other
documents with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding
comments from, or unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Parent SEC Documents. No enforcement action has been initiated
against Parent relating to disclosures contained or omitted from any Parent
SEC Document.

(e) Parent makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised
and maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, in all material
respects, as required pursuant to Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act.
Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and the applicable listing
standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to its management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Parents principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board
(x) all significant deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal
controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents auditors
any material weakness in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls.

 

(f) Since January 1, 2015, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of Parent have made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to knowledge)
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in any such
certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities or its
officers have received notice from any Governmental Authority questioning or
challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or submission
of such certification. As of the date of this Agreement, and except as
disclosed in a Parent SEC Document filed with the SEC prior to the date of
this Agreement, none of such entities has any knowledge of any material
weaknesses in the design or operation of such internal controls over financial
reporting.

 

Section 5.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Balance

threatened in writing with respect to any of their respective properties or
assets at law or in equity before any Governmental Authority, and there are
no orders, judgments, decrees or similar rulings of any Governmental Authority

the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.8 _Compliance With Laws; Permits_.

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31,
2013 and their respective dates of incorporation, formation or organization,

the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits necessary
for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties
and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted
(collectively, the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any
of the Parent Permits has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
Parent Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in
full force and effect has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of the Parent Permits is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing, except where such suspension
or cancellation has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and
its Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2013 have not been, in
violation or breach of, or default under, any Parent Permit, except where
such violation, breach or default has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event or condition has occurred
or exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a
benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit, or has caused (or would cause)
an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or
extend, any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of
time or both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses,
accelerations or failures that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. The Parent Permits will not be subject to suspension, modification,
revocation or non-renewal as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except,
in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. No Proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened with respect to any alleged failure by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to have any material Permit necessary for the operation of
any asset or the conduct of their businesses or to be in compliance therewith,
except, in each case, as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

representations and warranties of the Partnership and the Partnership GP, set
forth in _Section 4.9_ , none of the information supplied (or to be supplied)
in writing by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in (a) the Registration Statement will, at the
time the Registration Statement, or any amendment or supplement thereto, is
filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading and (b) the Joint Proxy Statement will, on
the date it is first mailed to Limited Partners and the Parent Stockholders,

Section 5.11 _Contracts_.

 

(a) Except for this Agreement or as filed or publicly furnished with the
SEC prior to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by, as of the date of this Agreement, any
Contract (whether written or oral) which is a "material contract" (as such

Section 6.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that the
Partnership or the Partnership GP or any applicable Subsidiary thereof would
be permitted to indemnify an Indemnified Person immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity jointly and severally agree to
(i) indemnify and hold harmless against any reasonable costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses
and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs,
retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as
well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in
or participate in, any Proceeding, including any Proceeding relating to a
claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Person),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities, penalties and
amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other
charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, and, upon receipt by
Parent of an undertaking by or on behalf of 

 



48  the Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall be determined in a
final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified, provide
advancement of expenses with respect to each of the foregoing to, all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
(ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of officers and
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Organizational Documents of the
Partnership and the Partnership GP immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and ensure that the Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the
Partnership GP or any of their respective successors or assigns, if
applicable, shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers and employees of the Partnership and the Partnership GP than are
presently set forth in such Organizational Documents. Any right of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section 6.7(a)_ shall not be amended,
repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein, and
shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Person and their respective heirs
and representatives against Parent and the Partnership GP and their respective
successors and assigns.

 

(b) Parent shall maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective
Time Parents current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons (provided that Parent may substitute therefor
policies with reputable carriers of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300%
of current annual premiums paid by Parent for such insurance (the " _Maximum
Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, Parent would be required to expend more than the Maximum
Amount, Parent shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance as is
available for the Maximum Amount. If Parent in its sole discretion elects,
then, in lieu of the obligations of Parent under this _Section 6.7(b)_ ,
Parent may (but shall be under no obligation to), prior to the Effective
Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or
alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified Persons in their capacity
as such.

(c) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 6.7_ shall be
in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Organizational Documents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP, any
indemnification agreements, or the DLLCA and DRULPA. The provisions of this
_Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement for a period of six (6) years and are expressly intended to
benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and
representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that any claim or
claims for indemnification or advancement set forth in this _Section 6.7_ are
asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all rights
to indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or claims
shall continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent and/or the
Partnership GP, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other
Person, then,

 



49  in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or the Partnership GP shall
assume the obligations of Parent and the Partnership GP set forth in this
_Section 6.7_.

Section 6.8 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.2_ and _Section 8.3_ , all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the

Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of

Agreement until the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Partnership shall
coordinate with the other regarding the declaration of any dividends or
distributions in respect of Parent Common Stock and Partnership Interests and
the record dates and payment dates relating thereto, it being the intention of
the parties that holders of Partnership Interests shall not receive, for any
quarter, distributions both in respect of Partnership Interests and also
dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange
therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for any such quarter
either: (a) only distributions in respect of Partnership Interests or (b) only
dividends in respect of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange
therefor in the Merger. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated

Committee or remove or cause the removal of any director of the Partnership GP
that is a member of the GP Conflicts Committee either as a director or as a
member of such committee. For the avoidance of doubt, this  _Section 6.12_
shall not apply to the filling, in accordance with the provisions of the
Partnership GP LLC Agreement, of any vacancies caused by the resignation,
death or incapacity of any such director.

cause the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that actions or inactions by the Partnership and the Partnership GP and their
respective Subsidiaries shall not be deemed to be breaches or violations or
failures to perform by Parent or its Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of
this Agreement unless such action or inaction was or was not taken at the
direction of or on the recommendation of, or with respect to the Partnership
and the Partnership GP and their respective Subsidiaries and subject to
_Section 6.2(b)_ , with the consent of, Parent.

 

Section 6.14 _Cooperation with Debt and Equity Financing_. From and after
the date of this Agreement, the Partnership shall, and the Partnership shall

and their representatives (including their auditors) to, use its respective

and to enable Parent to prepare pro forma financial statements) as reasonably

financing or any capital markets debt or equity financing, any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Merger; it
being understood that the arrangement of any bank debt financing or any
capital markets debt financing or the repayment or refinancing of any debt
shall not be a condition to Parents or Merger Subs obligations to effect the
Merger. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership GP, the
Partnership and their respective Subsidiaries from and against any and all
losses or damages actually suffered or incurred by them directly in connection
with the arrangement of any such bank debt financing or any capital markets
debt financing.

purposes (and for purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that
follows the United States federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to
treat the Merger (a) with respect to the holders of Common Units (other than
Common Units held by Parent and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time) (the " _Public Common Units_ "), as a taxable sale of the
Public Common Units to Parent and (b) with respect to Parent, as a purchase of
the Public Common Units from the holders of such Common Units. The parties
will prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will
not take any inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of
any Proceeding with respect to Taxes, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law following a final determination by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other administrative settlement with or final administrative
decision by the relevant Governmental Authority.

contemplated hereby, including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance, may

of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger and the Parent Stock Issuance.

GP shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or

Partnership GP and/or their directors (as applicable) relating to the

in this Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would
(if it occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and
(B) is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent within thirty (30)
days following receipt of written notice from the Partnership of such breach
or failure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ if the
Partnership or the Partnership GP is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or

 

(iii) if prior to receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval, in
response to an Intervening Event, the GP Board or the GP Conflicts Committee
shall have determined to terminate this Agreement as contemplated in _Section
6.3(b)_ ; _provided_ , that the Partnership shall have complied in all
material respects with _Section 6.3(b)_. 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement as provided in  _Section 8.1_ , written notice thereof shall
be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision of this
Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions in the last
sentence of _Section 6.6_ , the provisions in _Section 6.8_ , this _Section
8.2_ , _Section 8.3_ and _Article IX_ , all of which shall survive termination
of this Agreement), and, except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.2_ ,
there shall be no liability on the part of any of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Partnership and the Partnership GP or their respective directors, officers and
Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve
any party hereto from (a) its obligation to pay the Parent Expenses, the
Partnership Expenses, the Termination Payment, the Termination Amount, or the
Break-Up Amount, or to make the amendment with respect to any Termination
Amount or Break-Up Amount, in each case if, as and when required pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ , (b) any liability for any failure to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement when required
pursuant to this Agreement or (c) any liability for intentional fraud or a
willful breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement.
For purposes of this _Section 8.2_ , " _willful breach_ " shall mean a
material breach of this Agreement that is a consequence of a deliberate act
or a deliberate failure to act by the breaching party with the knowledge that
the taking of such act (or the failure to take such act) would (x) cause a
material 

 



56  breach of this Agreement and (y) prevent or materially delay the Closing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Partnership GP or the
Partnership have any liability for any matter set forth in the proviso of the
preceding sentence for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Partnership GP, the Partnership, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives at the direction of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

Section 8.3 _Termination Amounts; Expenses_. 

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or Parent
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(i)_ (Outside Date), then Parent
shall pay to the Partnership (or its designated Affiliate) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Partnership an
amount equal to the Partnership Expenses, and such payment shall be made
within three (3) Business Days after such termination.

(b) If (i) no Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred and
(ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or Parent
pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ (No Partnership Unitholder
Approval), then Parent shall pay to the Partnership (or its designated
Affiliate) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by the Partnership an amount equal to the Partnership Expenses, and
such payment shall be made within three (3) Business Days after
such termination.

(c) If (i) no Parent Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred and (ii)
this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or Parent pursuant to
the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ (No Parent Stockholder Approval), then
Parent shall pay to the Partnership (or its designated Affiliate) by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Partnership an amount equal to the Partnership Expenses, and such payment
shall be made within three (3) Business Days after such termination. For
purposes of this _Section 8.3(c)_ , the term "Partnership Expenses" shall
have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 1.1(a)_ , except that the
reference to "$10,000,000" therein shall be replaced with "$20,000,000."

 

(d) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(ii)_ (Parent Uncured Breach), then Parent shall cause the
Partnership GP to, within three (3) Business Days after such termination,
execute the IDR Amendment in accordance with _Section 8.3(m)_ with a reduction
amount equal to the Termination Amount.

 

(e) If (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Alternative Proposal is
publicly proposed or publicly disclosed prior to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting, (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership or
Parent pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.1(b)(iv)_ (No Parent
Stockholder Approval), and (iii) at any time on or prior to the
12-month anniversary of such termination, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a definitive agreement in respect of an Alternative Proposal or
consummates an Alternative Proposal, then Parent shall cause the Partnership
GP to, concurrently with the consummation of such Alternative Proposal,
execute the IDR Amendment in accordance with _Section 8.3(m)_ with a reduction
amount equal to the Break-Up Amount. For purposes of clause (iii) of this
_Section 8.3(e)_ only, the term "Alternative Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in _Section 6.3(g)(ii)_ except that all references to
"25%" therein shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

 



57 (f) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ (Parent Superior Proposal), then Parent shall cause the
Partnership GP to, concurrently with such termination, execute the IDR
Amendment in accordance with _Section 8.3(m)_ with a reduction amount equal to
the Break-Up Amount.

(g) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Partnership pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(i)_  (Parent Adverse Recommendation Change), then Parent
shall cause the Partnership GP to, within three (3) Business Days after such
termination, execute the IDR Amendment in accordance with _Section 8.3(m)_
with a reduction amount equal to the Break-Up Amount.

(h) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(i)_  (Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change), then the Partnership
shall, within three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay to Parent,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent, the Termination Payment; _provided, however_ , that if the
Intervening Event, in response to which the GP Conflicts Committee has made a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change, is a material event, fact or
circumstance, development or occurrence that is the direct and reasonably
foreseeable result of a deliberate act by Parent (or its Affiliates), then the
Partnership shall only be obligated to pay to Parent the Parent Expenses (in
lieu of the Termination Payment), and such payment shall be made within three
(3) Business Days after such termination.

(i) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Parent pursuant to 
_Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ (Partnership Uncured Breach), then the Partnership shall,
within three (3) Business Days after such termination, pay to the Parent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Parent, the Parent Expenses.

(j) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Partnership pursuant to
_Section 8.1(d)(iii)_ (Partnership Intervening Event Termination Right), then
the Partnership shall, within three (3) Business Days after such termination,
pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Parent, the Break-Up Amount; _provided, however_ , that if the
Intervening Event, in response to which the GP Conflicts Committee has
terminated this Agreement, is a material event, fact or circumstance,
development or occurrence that is the direct and reasonably foreseeable
result of a deliberate act by Parent (or its Affiliates), then the Partnership
shall only be obligated to pay to Parent the Parent Expenses (in lieu of the
Break-Up Amount), and such payment shall be made within three (3) Business
Days after such termination.

(k) In no event shall Parent or the Partnership be required (i) to pay
(or, in the case of Parent, to cause the Partnership GP to make the amendment
contemplated by _Section 8.3(m)_ ) in respect of both a Termination Amount
(or, in the case of the Partnership, a Termination Payment) and a Break-Up
Amount or (ii) to pay the Termination Payment, the Termination Amount, or the
Break-Up Amount (or cause the Partnership GP to make the amendment
contemplated by _Section 8.3(m)_ ) on more than one occasion. In the event
that Parent pays the Partnership Expenses pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ ,
then any reduction amount in respect of any Termination Amount or Break-Up
Amount required to be included in the IDR Amendment under this _Section 8.3_
shall be reduced by the amount of the Partnership Expenses previously paid.
In the event that the Partnership pays the Parent Expenses pursuant to this

 



58   _Section 8.3_ , then any Termination Payment or Break-Up Amount required to
be paid by the Partnership under this _Section 8.3_ shall be reduced by the
amount of the Parent Expenses previously paid.

(l) The parties acknowledge that payment of the Parent Expenses, the
Partnership Expenses, the Termination Payment, the Termination Amount or the
Break-Up Amount (or any amendment pursuant to _Section 8.3(m)_ in respect of
the Termination Amount or the Break-Up Amount), as applicable, if, as and when
required pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ , shall not constitute a penalty but
will be liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the
party receiving such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision, and shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy with respect thereto, except as expressly set forth in
_Section 8.2_.

(m) If required under this  _Section 8.3_ , Parent shall cause the
Partnership GP to execute an amendment to the Partnership Agreement providing
for the reduction in distributions payable by the Partnership to the holders
of the Incentive Distribution Rights (such amendment to be substantially in
the form set forth in _Section 8.3(m)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the
" _IDR Amendment_ ") in an amount equal to the amount so required under this
_Section 8.3_ (after giving effect to any reduction contemplated by _Section
8.3(k)_ ), and, if the event giving rise to such payment obligation occurs and
Parent makes such election, Parent hereby does consent to such amendment and
agrees to cause any of its Subsidiaries that are required to consent to such
amendment to do so.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc_. The representations, warranties and
agreements in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement)
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.2_ , upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1_ , as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in _Article I_
, _Article II_ , _Article III_ and the last sentence of _Section 6.6_ ,
_Section 6.8_ and _Section 6.10_ and any other agreement in this Agreement
that contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive the
Effective Time.

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval and
the Parent Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto,
by action taken or authorized by the Parent Board or Parent Special Committee,
as the case may be, and the GP Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP
Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has first referred
such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for its consideration, and permitted
the GP Conflicts Committee not less than two (2) Business Days to make a
recommendation to the GP Board with respect thereto (for the avoidance of
doubt, the GP Board shall in no way be obligated to follow the recommendation
of the GP Conflicts Committee and

 



59  the GP Board shall be permitted to take action following the expiration of
such two (2) Business Day period); _provided_ , _further_ , that following
receipt of the Partnership Unitholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder
Approval, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions of this
Agreement which by applicable Law or stock exchange rule would require further
approval by the Limited Partners or Parent Stockholders, as applicable,
without such approval.

Section 9.3 _GP Board Consent_. Unless otherwise expressly set forth
in this Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval or consent of
the Partnership or Partnership GP is required pursuant to this Agreement, such
determination, decision, approval or consent must be authorized by the GP
Board;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP Board may not take or authorize
any such action unless it has first referred such action to the GP Conflicts
Committee for its consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts Committee not
less than two (2) Business Days to make a recommendation to the GP Board with
respect thereto.

Section 9.4 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such partys conditions or (d) make or grant any consent under this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, the GP Board may not take or authorize any such action unless it has
first referred such action to the GP Conflicts Committee for
its consideration, and permitted the GP Conflicts Committee not less than two
(2) Business Days to make a recommendation to the GP Board with respect
thereto (for the avoidance of doubt, the GP Board shall in no way be obligated
to follow the recommendation of the GP Conflicts Committee and the GP Board
shall be permitted to take action following the expiration of such two (2)
Business Day period) and, following the Partnership Unitholder Approval, the
GP Board may not take or authorize any such action without the prior written
consent of the GP Conflicts Committee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Partnership, the Partnership GP, Parent or Merger Sub
in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall
any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may
assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, but
no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this _Section 9.5_ shall be null, void and
ineffective.

Section 9.6 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute

 



60  one and the same agreement) and shall become effective when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile
transmission, by electronic mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form,
or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and
pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical
delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature.

Section 9.7 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement, the Partnership Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule
and any certificates delivered by any party pursuant to this agreement (a)
constitute the entire agreement and understanding, and supersede all other
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall
not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
(including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder,
except for, in the case of _clause (b)_ , the provisions of _Section 6.7_ and
_Section 9.12_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
_Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.12_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable
by, any financing sources or lender providing financing in connection with the
Merger.

 

Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
the laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to
be performed entirely within that State.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware); _provided_ , _however_ , each of the parties hereto
irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action or proceeding arising
out of or in connection with any debt financing in connection with the Merger
shall be brought only in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable Laws exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or
proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees
not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.8_ ,
(ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (A) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in
an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding
is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



61 (c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 9.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 9.9_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each
party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.9_ , and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 

Section 9.10 _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
must be in writing and will be deemed duly given if delivered personally or
