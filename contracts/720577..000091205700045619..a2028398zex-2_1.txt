This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 16, 2000
(this "AGREEMENT"), by and among V.S.M. Investors, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "PARENT"), V.S.M. Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Parent ("Holdings"), V.S.M.
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdings ("MERGER SUB"), and Sunrise Medical, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "COMPANY").   W I T N E S S E T H :   WHEREAS, the Parent and the
Company have each determined that it is in their respective best interests
for the Parent to acquire the Company, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of
Directors of the Parent, Holdings, Merger Sub and the Company each have
approved this Agreement and the Merger (as defined below) of the Merger Sub
with and into the Company and, in order to effectuate the Merger, Merger Sub
proposes to make a cash tender offer (as such offer may be amended or
extended from time to time as provided herein, the "OFFER"), upon the terms
and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, to purchase all of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Company, together with the associated Rights (as defined below)
attached thereto (collectively, the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), at a price per
share equal to the Price Per Share (as defined below), subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein and in Annex A hereto;   WHEREAS, upon
consummation of the Offer, and as soon as may be permitted thereafter, Merger
Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the "MERGER") in accordance
with this Agreement and the relevant provisions of the DGCL (as defined
below), and the surviving corporation of the Merger shall be the Company;
and   WHEREAS, the Company Board (as defined below), subsequent to the
unanimous recommendation of a special committee of the Company Board (the
"SPECIAL COMMITTEE"), has determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are
fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, has
approved the Merger, the Offer, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has declared the Merger and this Agreement to
be advisable, and has recommended acceptance of the Offer, approval of the
Merger and adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company.  
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as
follows:   1      ARTICLE I  THE TENDER OFFER  1.1 THE OFFER.  
(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Article VII, then (i) not later than the first Business Day (as defined
below) after execution of this Agreement, the Parent and the Company shall
issue a public announcement of the execution of this Agreement and
(ii) Merger Sub shall, as soon as practicable, but in no event later than
ten Business Days after the date of such announcement, commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2(a) under the Exchange Act (as defined below)) the Offer
to purchase all of the outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock at the
price of $10 per share, net to the seller of such shares in cash (such price,
or such higher price per share of the Company Common Stock as may be paid in
the Offer, the "PRICE PER SHARE"). The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for
payment, purchase and pay for shares of the Company Common Stock tendered
pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to (A) at least that number of
shares of the Company Common Stock equivalent to a majority of the total
issued and outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock on a fully diluted
basis (assuming the exercise of all outstanding Options (as defined in
Section 3.1(b)(i) (other than Options held by the Management Group (as
defined below)) and any other rights to acquire shares of the Company Common
Stock) on the date such shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer being
validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer (the
"MINIMUM CONDITION"), and (B) the satisfaction of the other conditions set
forth in ANNEX A hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference, any of
which conditions may be waived by the Parent in its sole discretion;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Parent shall not waive the Minimum Condition or
the Antitrust Condition (as defined below) without the prior written consent
of the Company. The Company agrees that no shares of the Company Common Stock
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined below) will be
tendered to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer.   (b) The Parent and Merger
Sub expressly reserve the right, in their sole discretion, to make any
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, provided that without the
prior written consent of the Company, neither the Parent nor Merger Sub will
(i) decrease the Price Per Share payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the
number of shares of the Company Common Stock sought pursuant to the Offer or
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) add, waive,
change or amend the terms of or conditions to the Offer (including the
conditions set forth in ANNEX A hereto) in any manner adverse to the holders
of shares of the Company Common Stock or (iv) change the expiration date of
the Offer; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if on any scheduled expiration date of the
Offer, which shall initially be 20 Business Days after the commencement date
of the Offer, all conditions to the Offer have not been satisfied or waived,
Merger Sub may, from time to time, extend the expiration date of the Offer
for one or more periods of up to ten additional Business Days each (but in no
event shall Merger Sub be permitted to extend the expiration date of
the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as defined below)); provided, further,
that if on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Offer shall not
have been consummated (A) due to the failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition
or any of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (d)(i) (so long as
with respect to paragraph (d)(i), the relevant representation or warranty is
reasonably capable of being cured within ten calendar days by the exercise of
reasonable best efforts and an executive officer of the Company certifies
in   2    writing that such representation or warranty is reasonably
capable of being cured by the Company within ten calendar days through the
exercise of such reasonable best efforts) and (e) of Annex A (except with
respect to paragraph (d)(i), other than as a result of a breach by the
Company), at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall from time to time
extend the expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods of up to ten
additional Business Days each for up to an aggregate of 20 Business Days (but
in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the expiration date of the
Offer beyond the Outside Date); or (B) due to the failure to satisfy the
condition to the Offer relating to the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act (as defined below) or the compliance with
any applicable foreign legal requirements relating to competition
(collectively, the "Antitrust Condition") or the Financing Condition (as
defined in Annex A), then, at the request of the Company, Merger Sub shall
extend any such expiration date of the Offer for one or more periods of up to
ten additional Business Days each (but in no event shall Merger Sub
be required to extend the expiration date of the Offer beyond the Outside
Date); and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Merger Sub may, (1) without the consent of
the Company, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC (as defined below)
applicable to the Offer in the event of an increase in the Price Per Share or
as otherwise required by law and (2) extend the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-11 under the Exchange Act if (x) the conditions to the Offer shall have
been satisfied or waived and shall not apply to any extension, (y) the number
of shares of the Company Common Stock that have been validly tendered and not
withdrawn represent more than 50% but less than 90% of the issued and
outstanding shares of the Company Common Stock and (z) Merger Sub shall
accept and promptly pay for all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered and not withdrawn; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall the
extensions permitted under the foregoing clause (2) exceed, in the aggregate,
ten Business Days. The Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub will, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, use their reasonable best efforts to
consummate the Offer. Assuming the prior satisfaction or waiver of all the
conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (i) Merger Sub shall, and the Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, purchase and pay for, in
accordance with the terms of the Offer, all shares of the Company Common
Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as
practicable, recognizing that the parties wish to close as expeditiously as
possible following satisfaction of the Antitrust Condition, and (ii) the
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Merger Sub, on a timely
basis, the funds necessary to purchase any shares of the Company Common Stock
that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer. Merger
Sub may, at any time, transfer or assign to one or more corporations directly
or indirectly wholly-owned by the Parent the right to purchase all or any
portion of the shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, provided that any such
transfer or assignment shall not prejudice the rights of tendering
stockholders to receive payment for shares of Company Common Stock properly
tendered and accepted for payment.  1.2 SEC FILINGS.   (a) The Offer
shall be made pursuant to an offer to purchase (the "OFFER TO PURCHASE") and
related letter of transmittal in forms containing the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement. As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is
commenced, the Parent shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") a Transaction Statement on Schedule 13E-3 with respect to the
Offer which shall be filed as part of a Tender Offer Statement   3    on
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto,
the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer that will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of, and satisfy in all material
respects the requirements of, such Schedule TO and all applicable federal
securities laws, and will contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by
reference the Offer to Purchase and forms of the related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (which documents, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, and any other SEC schedule or form that is
filed in connection with the Offer and related transactions, are referred to
collectively herein as the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). The Company and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment upon the Offer Documents
and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC, and the Parent and Merger Sub shall consider such comments in good
faith. The Parent and Merger Sub agree to provide to the Company and its
counsel any comments which the Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may
receive from the staff of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt thereof. The Company shall promptly supply to the
Parent and Merger Sub in writing, for inclusion in the Offer Documents,
all information concerning the Company or any of its affiliates required by
law, rule or regulation to be included in the Offer Documents. The Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct promptly any information provided
by any of them for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents which shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO
as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case as
and to the extent required by the applicable provisions of the federal
securities laws.   (b) The Company shall file with the SEC a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") containing the
recommendation of the Company Board described in Section 1.3(a) (subject to
the right of the Company Board to withdraw, amend or modify such
recommendation in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) which will
comply as to form and content in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the federal securities laws. The Company will cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed on the same date that the Schedule TO is
filed. The Parent and Merger Sub will cooperate with the Company in mailing
or otherwise disseminating the Schedule 14D-9 with the appropriate Offer
Documents to the stockholders of the Company. The Parent and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment upon the Schedule 14D-9
and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith. The
Company agrees to provide to the Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel any
comments which the Company or its counsel may receive from the staff of the
SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt thereof. The
Parent and Merger Sub will promptly supply to the Company in writing, for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9, all information concerning the Parent and
Merger Sub or any of their affiliates required by law, rule or regulation to
be included in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company, the Parent and Merger Sub
agree to correct promptly any information provided by any of them for use in
the Schedule 14D-9 which shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary
to cause such Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Company\'s stockholders, in each case as and to the
extent required by the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.
The Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each hereby agree to provide promptly
such information necessary to the preparation of the exhibits and schedules
to the   4     Schedule TO, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents
which the respective party responsible therefor shall reasonably request.  
(c) Each party hereto shall file all written communications, including
the first public announcement issued pursuant to Section 1.1(a)(i) above
in connection with the execution of this Agreement, that are made public
or otherwise supplied to Persons (as defined below) not parties to the
transactions contemplated hereby, with the SEC on or prior to the date the
communication is first used. All such communications shall comply as to form
and content, including bearing the appropriate legends, in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the federal securities laws. Each
party agrees that, prior to any such filing or use of written communications,
such party will provide the other party and their counsel the opportunity to
review and comment on such communications and filings.  1.3 COMPANY
ACTION.   (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and
represents and warrants that (i) the Company Board, based on the unanimous
recommendation of the Special Committee, at a meeting duly called and held on
October 16, 2000, unanimously and duly (A) approved and adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger (such approval being sufficient to render Section 203 of the DGCL
inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), (B)
recommended that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender
their shares of the Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and adopt this
Agreement, (C) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in
the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (D) declared the
Merger and this Agreement to be advisable, and (E) rendered the Rights
Agreement (as defined below) inapplicable to the transactions contemplated
hereby as contemplated by Section 3.1(p) hereof, and (ii) Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. (also operating as Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown) ("Deutsche Banc
Alex. Brown") and Batchelder and Partners, Inc., the Special Committee\'s
financial advisors, respectively, have each rendered to the Special Committee
its oral opinion which shall be confirmed in writing no later than two days
from the date of this Agreement, each dated the date of this Agreement,
to the effect that, as of such date, the Price Per Share to be received by
the holders of shares of the Company Common Stock (other than the Parent,
the Management Group, any other members of management who have agreed to
invest in the Parent and their affiliates) pursuant to the Offer and the
Merger is fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders. The full
text of such opinions by each of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown and Batchelder and
Partners, Inc. shall be included without deletion or modification in the
Offer to Purchase, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, if applicable.
The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the
recommendations of the Company Board set forth above. The Company Board shall
not withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to the Parent or Merger Sub
such recommendations (or announce publicly its intention to do so) except as
expressly permitted in Section 5.4 of this Agreement.   (b) Promptly upon
execution of this Agreement and in connection with the Offer, the Company
shall furnish Merger Sub with such information (including a list of the
stockholders of the Company, mailing labels, non-objecting beneficial owners
lists and a list of securities positions, each as of a recent date), and
shall thereafter render such assistance, as the   5    Parent or Merger
Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Company\'s
stockholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable law and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Merger, the Parent and Merger Sub and
each of their respective affiliates and associates shall (a) hold
in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists, (b)
use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and (c)
if this Agreement is terminated, promptly deliver to the Company all copies
of such information then in their possession.  1.4 COMPOSITION OF THE
COMPANY BOARD.   (a) Subject to Section 1.4(b) hereof, promptly upon the
acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub in accordance with the
Offer for, not less than a majority of the total issued and outstanding
shares of the Company Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (assuming the
exercise of all outstanding Options (other than Options held by the
Management Group) and any other rights to acquire shares of the Company
Common Stock on the date of purchase) pursuant to the Offer, Merger Sub shall
be entitled to designate such number of members of the Company Board, rounded
up to the next whole number, equal to that number of directors which equals
the product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (giving
effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the
percentage that such number of shares of the Company Common Stock owned in
the aggregate by Merger Sub or the Parent, upon such acceptance for payment,
bears to the number of shares of the Company Common Stock then outstanding;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that until the Effective Time (as defined below) the
parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
ensure that there shall be at least two Continuing Directors (as defined
below), such Continuing Directors initially to be selected by a majority of
the Continuing Directors as of the date hereof. Upon the written request of
Merger Sub, the Company shall, on the date of such request, (i) either
increase the size of the Company Board or secure the resignations of such
number of its incumbent directors as is necessary to enable the Merger Sub\'s
designees to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board and (ii) cause
the Merger Sub\'s designees to be so elected or appointed, in each case as
may be necessary to comply with the foregoing provisions of this Section
1.4(a). At such time, the Company shall, if requested by Merger Sub, also
take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub\'s designees to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as such
designees represent on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of
the Company and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board of
directors.   (b) The Company\'s obligation under Section 1.4(a) to cause
designees of Merger Sub to be elected or appointed to the Company Board and
committees thereof shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule l4f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all
actions required pursuant to such Section 14(f) and Rule l4f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.4, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. The Parent,
Holdings and Merger Sub will supply to the Company any information with
respect to any of them and Merger Sub\'s nominees, and the officers,  
6    directors and affiliates of the Parent, Holdings and Merger Sub
required by such Section 14(f) and Rule l4f-1 and applicable rules and
regulations.   (c) After the time that Merger Sub\'s designees constitute at
least a majority of the Company Board and until the Effective Time, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any (i) amendment
or termination of this Agreement by or on behalf of the Company, (ii)
exercise or waiver of any of the Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder,
extension of time for the performance or waiver of any of the obligations or
other acts of the Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub hereunder, (iii) consent of
the Company contemplated hereby or waiver of any of the Company\'s rights
hereunder, (iv) amendment to the Company\'s Organizational Documents (as
defined below) or the Rights Agreement, or (v) other action by the Company in
connection with this Agreement required to be taken by the Company Board
(collectively, "Board Actions"), shall require the approval of a majority of
then-serving directors, if any, who are directors as of the date hereof (the
"CONTINUING DIRECTORS"), except to the extent that applicable law requires
that such action be acted upon by the full Company Board, in which case such
action will require the concurrence of both a majority of the Company Board
and a majority of the Continuing Directors. If a vacancy among the Continuing
Directors exists, the remaining Continuing Director or Directors shall be
entitled to designate persons to fill such vacancies, who shall be deemed
Continuing Directors for purposes of this Agreement. In the event there is
only one remaining Continuing Director and he or she resigns or is removed,
or if all Continuing Directors resign or are removed, he, she or they, as
applicable, shall be entitled to designate his, her or their successors, as
the case may be, each of whom shall be deemed a Continuing Director for
purposes of this Agreement. The Company Board shall not delegate any matter
set forth in this Section 1.4 to any committee of the Company Board.   (d)
In addition, prior to acceptance for payment and payment by Merger Sub for
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the Offer, any and
all Board Actions (which are material to the Company\'s stockholders who
are unaffiliated with the Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub) shall require the
approval of the Special Committee, except to the extent that applicable law
requires that any such action be taken by the full Company Board, in which
case such actions will require the concurrence of both a majority of the full
Company Board and a majority of the Special Committee.   ARTICLE II  THE
MERGER   2.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company,
as a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings, shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") in accordance with the DGCL. In the
event Merger Sub acquires at least 90% of the outstanding the Company Common
Stock through the Offer or otherwise, Merger Sub, Holdings and the Parent
shall effect the Merger pursuant to the "short-form" merger provisions of
Section 253 the DGCL in accordance with Section 5.1(c) of this Agreement.  
7    2.2 CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place
as soon as practicable after satisfaction or waiver (as permitted by this
Agreement and applicable law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date) set forth in
Article VI (the "CLOSING DATE"), unless another time or date is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett, 425 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.   2.3
EFFECTIVE TIME. Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger or
other appropriate documents (in any such case, the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER")
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall
make all other filings, recordings or publications required under the DGCL in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time as
the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, or at such other time as the parties may agree and specify
in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the
"EFFECTIVE TIME").   2.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. At and after the Effective
Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in Section 259, 260 and 261
of the DGCL.   2.5 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, and
by virtue of the Merger, the certificate of incorporation of the Company as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended to read in
its entirety, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Sunrise Medical, Inc.," as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately before the Effective Time and as provided in EXHIBIT A
hereto, and such amended certificate shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law.   2.6 BYLAWS. At the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be amended to read in its entirety, except that the
name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Sunrise Medical, Inc.," as the
bylaws of the Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable law.   2.7 OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF SURVIVING CORPORATION. The
officers of the Company shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation,
until the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be
an officer. The directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.   2.8 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. As of the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of the Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:  
(a) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become 23,000 fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.    8     (b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK
AND THE PARENT-OWNED STOCK. Each share of the Company Common Stock that is
owned by the Company and each share of the Company Common Stock that is owned
by the Parent, Holdings or Merger Sub shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no common stock of the Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, or any other form of
consideration, shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   (c) COMPANY COMMON
STOCK. Each issued and outstanding share of the Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than shares to
be canceled in accordance with Section 2.8(b) and any Dissenting Shares (as
defined below)) will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive in cash
the Price Per Share. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of the Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate (as defined below) which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of the Company Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon the
surrender of such Certificates as provided in Section 2.9, the Price Per
Share in cash.  2.9 SURRENDER AND PAYMENT.   (a) PAYING AGENT. Before the
Effective Time, the Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the record holders of shares of
the Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent").
At or before the Effective Time, the Parent will deposit, or cause Holdings
or Merger Sub to deposit, as applicable, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of Certificates with the Paying Agent immediately available funds
(the "FUNDS") in an amount necessary to make the payments for the shares of
the Company Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement on a timely
basis.   (b) SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES. Promptly after the Effective Time,
the Parent, Holdings and the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying
Agent to mail and/or make available to each record holder of shares of the
Company Common Stock, a notice and letter of transmittal and instructions in
standard form for use in effecting the surrender of all Certificates held by
such record holder.   (c) PAYMENT PROCEDURES. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal duly
executed and completed, the holder of such Certificate will receive the
aggregate Price Per Share attributable to the number of shares of the Company
Common Stock represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate will be
cancelled. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 2.9, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing
Dissenting Shares and Certificates representing shares covered by Section
2.8(b)) will represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
aggregate Price Per Share relating thereto. No interest shall accrue or be
paid in respect of cash payable upon the surrender of Certificates. If any
payment of cash in respect of canceled shares of the Company Common Stock is
to be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of the shares
represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor, it shall be a condition to such   9    payment that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly  endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person  requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other  Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the  registered holder of
such shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying  Agent that such
Tax has been paid or is not payable. Any consideration  otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to all applicable  federal, state
and local tax withholding requirements.   (d) NO TRANSFER. After the
Effective Time, there will be no transfers of shares of the Company Common
Stock recorded on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Price Per Share as
provided in Section 2.10(a) below.  2.10 UNCLAIMED MERGER CONSIDERATION.  
(a) TRANSFER TO SURVIVING CORPORATION. Any portion of the Funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.9(a) that remain
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company 180 days after the Effective
Time will be transferred to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any holder
of Certificates who has not theretofore complied with this Article II will
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Price
Per Share in accordance with this Agreement upon surrender of such
Certificates. The Paying Agent will be authorized, at the request of the
Parent, to invest any Funds held by it in (i) investment grade money market
instruments, (ii) direct obligations of the United States of America, (iii)
obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iv)
commercial paper rated the highest quality by either Moody\'s Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation or (v) certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers\' acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, in each case having maturities not
to exceed 30 days and as designated by the Parent, with any interest earned
thereon being paid to the Parent at the earlier of (A) payment in full of the
aggregate Price Per Share to all record holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger and (B) 180 days after
the Effective Time.   (b) NO ESCHEAT OF REMAINING FUNDS. None of the Parent,
Holdings, Merger Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent will be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash delivered from the Funds to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any
Certificates have not been surrendered before seven years after the Effective
Time (or immediately before such earlier date on which any payment pursuant
to this Section 2.10 would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Entity (as defined below)), the aggregate Price Per Share
payable in respect to such Certificates will, unless otherwise provided by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.   (c) MERGER CONSIDERATION. Any portion of the Funds made available
to the Paying Agent pursuant to Section 2.9(a) to pay the Price Per Share in
cash for shares of the   10    Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to the Parent, upon
demand.  2.11 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding Section 2.8 hereof, shares
of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger
or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (and who has neither
effectively withdrawn nor lost his right to such appraisal) ("DISSENTING
SHARES"), shall not be converted into a right to receive cash pursuant to
Section 2.8, and the holder thereof shall be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by the DGCL. If after the Effective Time such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal, such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into a right to receive cash as provided in Section 2.8,
without interest thereon. The Company shall give the Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of the Company
Common Stock, and the Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

3.1(b) or  in Section 3.1(b)(i), 3.1(b)(ii) or 3.1(b)(iv) of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule, there are no securities, options, warrants,  calls,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings  of any kind to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party  or by which any of
them is bound obligating the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries to issue,
deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,  delivered or sold, additional shares
of capital stock or other voting  securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,

Company or its Subsidiaries. There is no voting  trust or other agreement or
understanding to which the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries is a party or
is bound with respect to the voting  of the capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company of any  of its Subsidiaries. Except as it may be
limited with respect to any  foreign Subsidiary of the Company by the laws of
such foreign  jurisdiction, the Company has the ability to effect any
action  requiring the approval of the stockholders of any of its
Subsidiaries  and to designate all of the members of the board of directors
of each  of its Subsidiaries.   (c) AUTHORITY; NO CONFLICTS.   (i) The
Company has all requisite corporate power and  corporate authority to enter
into this Agreement and, subject to the  adoption of this Agreement by the
requisite vote of the holders of the  Company Common Stock (if required under
applicable law), to consummate  the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of  this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated  hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on  the part of the Company, subject in the case of the
consummation of  the Merger to any required adoption of this Agreement by the
holders  of the Company Common Stock. Subject to the adoption of this
Agreement  by the requisite vote of the holders of the Company Common Stock
(if  required by applicable law), this Agreement has been duly executed and 
delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and binding agreement  of
the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,  except as
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,  insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws relating to or  affecting
creditors generally and by general equity principles  (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a  proceeding in equity or at law).  
(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not  or will not, as
the case may be, and the consummation of the  transactions contemplated
hereby will not, conflict with, or result in  any violation of, or constitute
a default (with or without notice or  lapse of time, or both) under, or give
rise to a right of termination,  amendment, cancellation or acceleration of
any obligation or the loss  of a material benefit under, or the creation of a
Lien, on any assets  (any such conflict, violation, default, right of
termination,  amendment, cancellation or acceleration, loss or creation, a 
"VIOLATION") pursuant to: (A) any provision of the Organizational  Documents

of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a  material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light  of the circumstances under which

during the periods involved except as otherwise noted therein, and  subject,
in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to  normal and
recurring year-end adjustments that have not been and are  not expected to be
material in amount. Since January 1, 1998 there has  been no material change
in the Company\'s accounting methods or  principles except as described in
the notes to the consolidated  financial statements of the Company contained
in the Company SEC  Reports made available to the Parent prior to the date
hereof. All of  such Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (and
as of the  date of any amendment to the respective Company SEC Report),
complied  as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements  of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and 
regulations promulgated thereunder.   (ii) Except as set forth in the

or  material obligations of any nature required by GAAP to be set forth on 
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated 
Subsidiaries.   14    (e) INFORMATION SUPPLIED.   (i) None of the

14D-9 or (C) the  Offer Documents will, at the respective times such

Proxy  Statement, if any, when first published, sent or given to the 
stockholders of the Company, contain an untrue statement of material  fact or

order to make the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under
which they are made, not false or misleading or,  in the case of the Offer
Documents and the Proxy Statement, if any, or  any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, at the time of the  Company Stockholders Meeting (as
defined below), if any, and at the  Effective Time, contain an untrue

in light of the  circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading or  necessary to correct any statement in any earlier
communication with  respect to the Offer or any solicitation of proxies for
the Company  Stockholders Meeting which shall have become false or
misleading. The  Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with  the requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act
and the  rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.   (ii)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  Section 3.1(e), no
representation or warranty is made by the Company  with respect to (A)
statements made or incorporated by reference in  the Proxy Statement and
Schedule 14D-9 based on information supplied  by the Parent, Holdings or

received such Permits as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in

Effect on the Company. As of the date of this Agreement, no investigation by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its

other than investigations which would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   15     (g) LITIGATION. As of

required to be filed by any of them, and all such filed Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects; (ii) the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries have paid all Taxes (as defined below) that are due and

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (iv)
except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, there are no deficiencies or
claims for any Taxes that have been proposed, asserted or assessed against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, if such deficiencies or claims
were finally resolved against the Company or any of such Subsidiaries, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (v)

by reference to the Taxes, taxable income or taxable losses of any other
Person (other than contracts or arrangements entered into with employees,
consultants or independent contractors or in connection with purchase or sale
agreements or sale leasebacks, which contracts and arrangements would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company). The
Company and its Subsidiaries (A) are not, and have not been, a member of
an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return other
than a group the common parent of which is the Company, and (B) have no
liability for Taxes of any Person under Treasury Regulation 1.1502-6(a) (or

independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in  the U.S.
or Foreign Jurisdictions (the "COMPANY PARTICIPANTS") has any  present or
future right to material benefits or under which the  Company has any present

Disclosure Schedule, (a) each of the Company Benefit Plans has  been
established, operated and administered in compliance with  applicable law,
including but not limited to ERISA, the Code and  similar statutes and

Company Participants or their  dependents or beneficiaries beyond the Company
Participant\'s  termination of employment or termination of service of non-

Foreign Jurisdictions have engaged  in a transaction with respect to any
Company Benefit Plan which to the  Company\'s knowledge subjects such entity
to either a civil penalty  assessed pursuant to Sections 502(i) or 502(e) of
ERISA or a Tax  imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code or any
similar  applicable statutes and regulations in the Foreign Jurisdictions,

Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (f) to the knowledge of the  Company,
there are no pending or threatened claims (other than routine  claims for
benefits) by, on behalf of or against any of the Company  Benefit Plans or
any trusts related thereto, which would reasonably be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company; (g) no  event has occurred and no
condition exists that to the Company\'s  knowledge would subject the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in  Foreign Jurisdictions to any Tax, fine, lien,
penalty or other  liability with respect to any Company Benefit Plan imposed
by ERISA,  the Code or any similar applicable statutes and regulations in
the  Foreign Jurisdictions, which would reasonably be expected to have a 
Material Adverse Effect on the Company; and (h) all material  contributions
or other material amounts payable by the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries
in the U.S. and Foreign Jurisdictions as of the  Effective Time with respect
to any Company Benefit Plan in respect of  current or prior plan years which
are required to be reflected in the  Company\'s financial statements in
accordance with GAAP have been, in  all material respects, paid or accrued in
accordance with GAAP.   (iii) Except as provided pursuant to this Agreement
and  except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(l)(iv) of the Company Disclosure 
Schedule, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this  Agreement

contemplated hereby shall (a) result in any payment  becoming due to any
Company Participant; (b) increase any benefits  otherwise payable under any
Company Benefit Plan; (c) result in any  acceleration of the time of payment

is reasonably necessary in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to
the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law; (C) from participating
in negotiations or discussions with or furnishing information to any Person
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal not solicited after the date
hereof which is submitted in writing by such Person to the Company Board
after the date of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that prior to
participating in any such discussions or negotiations or furnishing any
information, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms not less favorable to the Company than the

shall have concluded in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal

available to a third party.   (c) The Company will immediately cease and
cause its advisors, agents and other intermediaries to cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and shall use its reasonable

information about the Company that was furnished by or on behalf of the
Company to return or destroy all such information in the possession of any
such party or in the possession of any agent or advisor of any such party.

taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any

a waiver thereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party hereto of
any right, power or privilege hereunder operate as a waiver of any other
right, power or privilege hereunder, nor shall any single or partial exercise

parties hereto may otherwise have at law or in equity. The failure of any

Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to a Section of or
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table
of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be

or proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any
federal, state, local or foreign statue or law shall be deemed also to refer
to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the content
requires otherwise. It is   42    understood and agreed that neither the
specifications of any dollar amount in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in the Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply that such
amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items so included or other items,
are or are not material, and neither party shall use the fact of setting of
such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of such item in the Schedules or
Exhibits in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any

of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall
become effective when two or more counterparts have been signed by each of
the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both
parties need not sign the same counterpart.  8.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO THIRD
PARTY BENEFICIARIES.   (a) This Agreement (including the Schedules and

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as

this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree or certain
jurisdictions will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held
