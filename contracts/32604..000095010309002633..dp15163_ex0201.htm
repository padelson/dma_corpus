ARTICLE 2 

 

THE OFFER

 



 

Section 2.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have
been validly terminated in accordance with Section 11.01, as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within 10 days) after the date hereof, Merger
Subsidiary shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the 1934
Act) the Offer. Merger Subsidiary's obligation to accept for payment and pay
for Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
prior to the expiration date thereof (as it may be extended from time to time
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) shall be subject solely to
the satisfaction or waiver (if permitted hereunder) of the conditions set
forth in Annex I hereto (the "Offer Conditions") and shall not be subject to
the satisfaction of any other conditions. The date on which Merger Subsidiary
commences the Offer is referred to as the "Offer Commencement Date". Merger
Subsidiary shall not (and Parent shall not permit Merger Subsidiary
to) terminate or otherwise withdraw the Offer unless and until this Agreement
has been validly terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Section 11.01.
In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to and in
accordance with Section 11.01, Merger Subsidiary shall promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day after the date of such termination) terminate
and withdraw the Offer and, notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of any
Offer Conditions, shall not accept for payment or pay for any Shares
theretofore tendered in the Offer.

 



 

(b)  Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any of the
Offer Conditions and, prior to the expiration of the Offer, to make any
change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer; provided that
notwithstanding the foregoing, without the prior written consent of the
Company, Merger Subsidiary shall not:

 



 

(i) impose conditions on Merger Subsidiary's obligation to accept for payment
and pay for Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer prior to the expiration of the Offer, other than the Offer
Conditions;

 

 

(ii)  waive or change the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I);

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) decrease the Offer Price;

 

 

 



 

 

(iv) change the form of consideration to be paid in the Offer;

 

 

 

(v)  decrease the number of Shares sought in the Offer;

 



 

(vi)  extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer except as
otherwise provided herein; or

 



 

(vii) amend or modify any of the Offer Conditions or amend or modify any of
the terms of the Offer, in either case in a manner that broadens any of the
Offer Conditions, would require Merger Subsidiary to extend the Offer or is
otherwise materially adverse to the holders of the Shares (in their capacity
as such).

 



 

(c)  Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall expire on
the date that is twenty business days (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) under the 1934 Act) after the Offer Commencement Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless this Agreement shall have been validly
terminated pursuant to and in accordance with Section 11.01, Merger
Subsidiary shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Subsidiary to) extend the
Offer (i) for successive extension periods of reasonable duration if, at the
scheduled expiration date of the Offer (as it may be extended from time to
time in accordance with this Agreement), any of the Offer Conditions shall
not have been satisfied or waived, until such Offer Conditions are satisfied
or waived, and (ii) for any period required by any applicable rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof or
NASDAQ or any period otherwise required by Applicable Law; provided that
Merger Subsidiary shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond (x) the
End Date or (y) the date that is 60 days after the date that all of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Condition and those that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the expiration of the Offer) have been satisfied or,
to the extent permissible, have been waived by Merger Subsidiary. If all of
the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived prior to the expiration of
the Offer, and Merger Subsidiary is permitted by Applicable Law to accept for
payment and pay for all Shares that have been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer prior to the expiration of the
Offer, Merger Subsidiary shall not (and Parent shall not permit Merger
Subsidiary to) extend the Offer for any reason without the prior written
consent of the Company. In the event that, following the expiration of the
Offer and Merger Subsidiary's acceptance for payment of all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary are unable to effect the Merger pursuant to the short form merger
procedures set forth in Section 253 of the Delaware Law, Merger Subsidiary
may, in its sole discretion, provide for a subsequent offering period
("Subsequent Offering Period") in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the 1934
Act.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and to
the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions, Merger Subsidiary shall,
and Parent shall cause it to, accept for payment and pay for, as promptly as
practicable (i) after the expiration of the Offer, all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date on which
and time at which Shares are first accepted for payment under the Offer, the
"Acceptance Date") and (ii) all Shares validly tendered in the Subsequent
Offering Period, if any.

 



 

(e) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule
TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall
include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, summary advertisement and other
customary documents, letters and other instruments (collectively, together
with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents") and
(ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, applicable rules or
regulations of NASDAQ or any other Applicable Laws. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents to comply in
all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and all other
Applicable Laws. The Company shall furnish Parent and Merger Subsidiary all
information concerning the Company required by the 1934 Act to be set forth
in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or
misleading in any material respect. In addition, if at any time prior to the
expiration of the Offer, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger,
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
is discovered by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents
so that the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, amended or supplemented, to be filed
with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws, applicable rules or
regulations of any stock exchange or any other Applicable Laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any such document
is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Subsidiary shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall provide the Company and its counsel with (i) any comments or
other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Subsidiary
or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those
comments or other communications and prior to responding to them, and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to
which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by
participating with Parent and Merger Subsidiary or their counsel in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 



 

Section 2.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer
and represents that the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of
Directors"), at a meeting duly called and held has unanimously (i) determined
that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company's
stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with
the requirements of the Delaware Law and (iii) subject to Section 7.04(b),
resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, and if required by
Delaware Law, adoption of this Agreement by its stockholders. The Company has
been advised that all of its directors and executive officers who own Shares
shall tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer. The Company shall promptly
furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any
available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all
record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in
stock depositories, in each case true and correct as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information
(including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of
securities positions) (the "Mailing Information") and such other assistance
as Parent may reasonably request in connection with the Offer. Subject to the
requirements of Applicable Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary
to disseminate the Offer Documents to consummate the Offer as contemplated
hereby and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger as
contemplated hereby, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their
Representatives shall keep confidential any Mailing Information provided by
or on behalf of Company pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) and (prior to the
Effective Time) use the Mailing Information only in connection with the Offer
and the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that this
Agreement is terminated (or the Offer is terminated for any reason), Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall (and shall cause their Representatives to)
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) return to the Company, shall
delete any and all electronic copies of, and shall not retain any copies or
duplicates of, any and all Mailing

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Information theretofore made available to Parent and Merger Subsidiary
pursuant to this Section 2.02(a) to facilitate the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, the Company shall
file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws, a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that, subject to
Section 7.04(b), shall reflect the recommendations of the Board of Directors
referred to above. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in
all material respects with the requirements of the 1934 Act and all other
Applicable Laws. The Company represents that it has obtained all necessary
consents to include in its entirety the fairness opinion of Morgan Stanley and
Co. Incorporated, financial advisor to the Company, in the Schedule 14D-9,
and the Schedule 14D-9 shall include such fairness opinion in its entirety
and a description of such fairness opinion and the material financial
analyses relating thereto that provides the information called for by Item
1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the 1934 Act. Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall furnish the Company all information concerning the Company required by
the 1934 Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such
information shall have become (or shall have become known to be) false or
misleading in any material respect. In addition, if at any time prior to the
expiration of the Offer, any information relating to the Offer, the Merger,
the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, or any of their respective affiliates
is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Schedule 14D-9 so that the
Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected, amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws, applicable rules or regulations of any
stock exchange or any other Applicable Laws. Unless the Board of Directors
has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section
7.04(b), Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 each time
before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their counsel. Unless the Board of Directors has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 7.04(b), the Company shall
provide Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their counsel with (i) any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments
or other communications and prior to responding thereto and (ii) a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the Company's response to those
comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and
good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with the
Company or its counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC.

 



 

Section 2.03. Directors. (a) Effective upon the Acceptance Date, subject to
Section 2.03(b) and Section 2.03(c), Parent shall be entitled to designate
the number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of
Directors that equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the
Board of Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors
pursuant to this Section) and (ii) the percentage that the number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary (including Shares
accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding, and
the Company shall cause Parent's designees to be elected or appointed to the
Board of Directors, including by increasing the number of directors, and
seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors. At such time, the
Company shall also cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the
number of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee
of the Board of Directors and (B) as requested by Parent, each board of
directors of each Subsidiary of the Company (and each committee thereof) that
represents the same percentage as such individuals represent on the Board of
Directors.

 



 

 

(b)   Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Section 2.03(a), at least two
(2) of the members of the Board of Directors as of the date hereof who are
not employees of the Company ("Continuing Independent Directors") shall
remain members of the Board of Directors until the Effective Time. If the
number of Continuing Independent Directors is reduced below two prior to the
Effective Time, the remaining Continuing Independent Director shall be
entitled to designate a Person to fill such vacancy who is not a director,
officer, employee or otherwise affiliated with Parent (other than as a result
of such designation), the Board of Directors shall cause such designee to be
appointed to the Board of Directors, and such designee shall thereupon be a
Continuing Independent Director for all purposes of this Agreement.
If, notwithstanding compliance with the foregoing provisions, the number
of directors who are Continuing Independent Directors is reduced to zero,
then the other directors on the Board of Directors shall designate and
appoint to the Board of Directors two directors who are not directors,
officers, employees or otherwise affiliated with Parent (other than as a
result of such designation), and such designees shall thereupon be Continuing
Independent Directors for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

 



 

(c) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Board of
Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the 1934 Act and Rule 14f-

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1 promulgated thereunder. Subject to receipt of the applicable information
from Parent with respect to its designees to the Board of Directors, the
Company shall promptly take all actions, and shall include in the
Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors, as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill
the Company's obligations under this Section 2.03. Parent shall supply to
the Company in writing and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates
required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to be disclosed to the stockholders
of the Company.

 



 

(d)  Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of
the Continuing Independent Directors (or, if there are two or fewer
Continuing Independent Directors, all of the Continuing Independent
Directors) shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall
constitute the authorization of the Board of Directors and no other action on
the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) (i) any termination of this
Agreement by the Company, (ii) any amendment of this Agreement, (iii) any
extension of time for performance of any obligation or action hereunder by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary and (iv) any waiver of compliance with any of the
terms or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company. The
Continuing Independent Directors shall have the authority to retain
independent legal counsel (which may include current counsel to the Company)
and other independent advisors at the expense of the Company as determined to
be appropriate by the Continuing Independent Directors and shall have the
authority to institute any action for and on behalf of the Company to enforce
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.04. Top-Up Option. (a) Subject to Sections 2.04(b) and 2.04(c),
the Company grants to Merger Subsidiary, an irrevocable option, for so long
as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof
(the "Top-Up Option"), to purchase from the Company, up to the number of
authorized and unissued Shares equal to the number of Shares that, when added
to the number of Shares owned by Merger Subsidiary at the time of the
exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes at least one Share more than 90%
of the Shares that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all
Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, calculated on a
fully-diluted basis or, at Parent's election, on a primary basis at the
Effective Time (such Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option,
the "Top-Up Shares").

 



 

(b)  The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Subsidiary in whole or in
part, only once, at any time during the ten Business Day period following
the Acceptance Date, or if any Subsequent Offering Period is provided, during
the ten Business Day period following the expiration date of such
Subsequent Offering Period, and only if Merger Subsidiary shall own as of
such time less than 90% of the Shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis;
provided

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up
Option shall not be exercisable to the extent that the number of
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the number
of authorized but unissued and unreserved Shares. The aggregate purchase
price payable for the Top-Up Shares being purchased by Merger Subsidiary
pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying the number
of such Top-Up Shares by the Offer Price, without interest. Such purchase
price may be paid by Merger Subsidiary, at its election, either (A) entirely
in cash or (B) by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the amount of such purchase price. Any
such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 3% per annum, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

 



 

(c) In the event Merger Subsidiary wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option,
Merger Subsidiary shall deliver to the Company a notice (the "Top-Up Notice")
setting forth (i) the number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Subsidiary intends
to purchase pursuant to the Top-Up Option, (ii) the manner in which Merger
Subsidiary intends to pay the applicable purchase price and (iii) the place
and time at which the closing of the purchase of such Top-Up Shares by Merger
Subsidiary is to take place. The Top-Up Notice shall also include an
undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary that, as promptly as
practicable following such exercise of the Top-Up Option, Merger Subsidiary
intends to (and Merger Subsidiary shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to, as promptly as practicable after such exercise) consummate the
Merger in accordance with Section 253 of Delaware Law as contemplated by
Section 3.01(b). At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall cause to be delivered to the Company the
consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Subsidiary a certificate
representing the Top-Up Shares. The parties hereto agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Shares to occur on the same day that the Top-Up Notice is deemed received by
the Company pursuant to Section 12.01, and if not so consummated on such day,
as promptly thereafter as possible. The parties further agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in accordance
with Section 253 of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section 3.01(b) as close
in time as possible to (including, to the extent possible, on the same day
as) the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

 



 

(d) Parent and Merger Subsidiary understand that the Top-Up Shares will not
be registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary represents, warrants and agrees that the Top-
Up Option is being, and the Top-Up Shares will be, acquired by Merger
Subsidiary for the purpose of investment and not with a view to or for resale
in connection with any distribution thereof within the meaning of the 1933
Act. Any certificates

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

evidencing Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by applicable
securities laws.

 



 

(e) Any dilutive impact on the value of the Shares as a result of the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares will not be taken into account in any
determination of the fair value of any dissenting Shares pursuant to Section
262 of Delaware Law as contemplated by Section 3.04.

 



 

Section 2.05. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Acceptance Date, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period (excluding any such change that results from any exercise
of options outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase Shares granted under
the Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, the
issuance of Shares in respect of Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares
outstanding as of the date hereof or granted in compliance with this
Agreement, the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Company ESPP in compliance
with this Agreement, or the exercise of the Top-Up Option to purchase the
Top-Up Shares), the Offer Price shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted
to reflect such change.

 



 

Section 2.06. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Offer Price
otherwise payable in respect of any Shares pursuant to the Offer such amounts
as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be, so withholds and timely remits amounts
to the applicable Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of
which the Exchange Agent, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be,
made such deduction and withholding. 

 



 

ARTICLE 3 

 

THE MERGER

 



 

Section 3.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

 



 

(b)  If, at any time after the Acceptance Date, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and
any other Subsidiary of Parent shall collectively own at least 90% of the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outstanding Shares, the parties shall take all necessary and appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable without
a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of
Delaware Law.

 



 

(c) Subject to the provisions of Article 10, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis Polk and
Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon as
possible, but in any event no later than three Business Days after the date
the conditions set forth in Article 10 have been satisfied, or at such other
place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree.

 



 

(d) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as
the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State
(or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

 



 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



 

Section 3.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.02(b), Section 3.02(c) or
Section 3.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(b) Each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled,
and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each Share held by any Subsidiary of Parent (other than the Merger
Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
such number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (except for
any such shares resulting from the conversion of Shares pursuant to Section
3.02(c)).

 



 

Section 3.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing Shares (the
"Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated
Shares"). Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the
Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall send,
or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the
Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall specify
that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange. 

 



 

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration payable for each Share
represented by a Certificate or for each Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all
purposes only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be canceled and

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this Article 3.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six months after the
Effective Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged such Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this Section 3.03 prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of Shares one year after the Effective Time (or such earlier date
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 



 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Shares for which appraisal
rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent, upon demand.

 



 

Section 3.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who
has demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to
appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated as if
they had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise
required by Applicable Law or a judgment, injunction or decree of a
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction, the Company shall not make
any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



 

Section 3.05. Stock Options. (a) Each option to purchase Shares outstanding
under any employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company (a "Company Stock Option"), whether or not vested or exercisable,
shall be canceled on the Acceptance Date, and the Company shall pay each
holder of any such option at or promptly after the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

21  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Acceptance Date for each such option an amount in cash determined
by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price per Share over
the applicable exercise price of such option by (ii) the number of Shares
such holder could have purchased (assuming full vesting of all options) had
such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the
Acceptance Date.

 



 

(b)  Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall (i) obtain any consents
from holders of options to purchase Shares granted under the Company's stock
option or compensation plans or arrangements and (ii) take any actions or
make any amendments to the terms of such stock option or compensation plans
or arrangements that, in the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), are
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by Section 3.05(a).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, payment may be withheld
in respect of any employee stock option until such necessary consents are
obtained.

 



 

Section 3.06. Performance Shares. The Company shall take all action
necessary to cause each Performance Share (whether an Earned Performance
Share or an Unearned Performance Share) outstanding under any equity or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, whether or not vested, to be
fully earned at maximum levels and fully vested and be canceled on the
Acceptance Date, and the Company shall pay the holder of any such share at or
promptly after the Acceptance Date an amount in cash equal to the product of
the Offer Price per Share and the number of Shares represented by such share.
For purposes of clarity, on and after the date of this Agreement, no
Performance Share award (or portion thereof) shall lapse due to failure to
achieve a performance metric relating to a performance period ending on or
after the date this Agreement, and any such performance metrics will be
deemed achieved at maximum levels on the Acceptance Date in accordance with
and pursuant to the foregoing sentence.

 



 

Section 3.07. Restricted Stock Units. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 3.07(a), the terms of each outstanding Restricted Stock Unit
shall be adjusted as necessary to provide that, at the Acceptance Date, each
Restricted Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Date
shall be converted into a restricted stock unit (each, an "Adjusted Unit")
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Acceptance Date, the number of
shares of Parent common stock equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to
the Acceptance Date multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, with such
resulting number of shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. "Exchange
Ratio" shall mean the quotient of (i) Offer Price, divided by (ii) the
closing price of a share of Parent common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the Acceptance Date. Each Adjusted Unit held by an award holder
shall fully vest upon the termination of employment of such award holder
initiated by the employer other than for "Cause" (as such term is defined in
Section 3.07(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) at any time on or

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

following the Acceptance Date. The foregoing provision shall be in addition
to, and not in replacement of, any acceleration of vesting
provisions contained in any award agreement, employment agreement or other
arrangement. Except as provided in this Section 3.07, each Adjusted Unit will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the equity compensation plan under which it was granted and the agreements
evidencing the grant thereof as in effect immediately prior to the Acceptance
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, each
Restricted Stock Unit held by a non-employee director of the Company, whether
or not vested, shall be fully vested and cancelled on the Acceptance Date and
the Company shall pay to each such holder at or promptly after the Acceptance
Date an amount in cash equal to the product of the Offer Price per Share and
the number of Shares represented by such Restricted Stock Unit.

 



 

(b) Parent shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the
Adjusted Units pursuant to this Section 3.07, including the reservation,
issuance and listing of Parent common stock as is necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Section 3.07. Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate form, or a post-
effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed under the
1933 Act, with respect to the shares of Parent common stock subject to the
Adjusted Units and, where applicable, shall have such registration statement
declared effective within five (5) Business Days following the Acceptance
Date and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
covering such Adjusted Units (and to maintain the current status of the
prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Adjusted Units remain
outstanding.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall take any actions with
respect to equity or compensation plans or arrangements that are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.07.

 



 

Section 3.08. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company shall take all
action that is necessary to (a) cause the exercise of each outstanding option
under the Company's 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company ESPP") no
less than ten Business Days prior to the initial scheduled expiration of the
Offer; (b) provide that no further purchase period or offering period shall
commence under the Company ESPP following that date; and (c) immediately
prior to and effective as of the Effective Time and subject to the
consummation of the Merger, terminate the Company ESPP.

 



 

Section 3.09. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class as a result of
any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period (excluding any such change that results from any exercise
of options

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

outstanding as of the date hereof to purchase Shares granted under the
Company's stock option or compensation plans or arrangements, the issuance of
Shares in respect of Restricted Stock Units or Performance Shares
outstanding as of the date hereof or granted in compliance with this
Agreement, the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Company ESPP in compliance
with this Agreement, or the exercise of the Top-Up Option to purchase the
Top-Up Shares), the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Article 3 shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted to
reflect such change.

 



 

Section 3.10. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration or any other consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Article 3 such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of
Tax law. If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, so withholds and timely remits amounts to the applicable Taxing
Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been paid to such Person in respect of which the Exchange Agent,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction
and withholding.

 



 

Section 3.11. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct in
conformity with the Exchange Agent's customary market practices, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article
3.

 



 



 

ARTICLE 4

Section 4.01. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificate of

Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in

Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the
officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 



 

ARTICLE 5 

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 



 

Subject to Section 12.05, except as disclosed in (a)(i) the Company's annual
report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 (the "Company
10-K"), (ii) the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly
periods ended March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, respectively, (iii) each of
the Company's current reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC since the date
of the filing of the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ended June 30, 2009 and prior to the date hereof or (iv) the
Company's proxy statement relating to its 2009 annual meeting of stockholders
(the documents referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv),
collectively, the "Company SEC Documents") or (b) as set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company represents and warrants to Parent that:

 



 

Section 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. (a) The Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers and all
authorizations, permits, consents, approvals and governmental licenses
required to carry on its business as now conducted, except for those
authorizations, permits, consents, approvals and licenses the absence of
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b)  The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to
Parent true and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Company as currently in effect.

 



 

Section 5.02. Corporate Authorization. (a) The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby are within the Company's
corporate powers and, except for the approval of the Company's stockholders
in connection with the consummation of the Merger (if required by Applicable
Law), have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares (if required by Applicable Law) is the only vote of the
holders of any of

Section 5.17. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Section 5.17(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a correct and complete list identifying each
material "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, each
employment, severance or similar contract, plan, arrangement or policy and
each other plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for compensation,
bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or other stock related rights or other
forms of incentive or deferred compensation, vacation benefits, insurance
(including any self-insured arrangements), health or medical benefits,
employee assistance program, disability or sick leave benefits, workers'
compensation, supplemental unemployment benefits, severance benefits and
post-employment or retirement benefits (including compensation, pension,
health, medical or life insurance benefits) which is maintained, administered
or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate and covers any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who
performs service in the United States, or with respect to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has any material liability. Copies of such plans
(and, if applicable, related trust or funding agreements or insurance
policies) and all amendments thereto have been furnished to Parent together
with the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable,
Schedule B thereto) and tax return (Form 990) prepared in connection with any
such plan or trust. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the
"Employee Plans."

 



 

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
sponsors, maintains or contributes to, or has in the past six years
sponsored, maintained or contributed to, any Employee Plan subject to Title
IV of ERISA.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

37  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
contributes to, or has in the past six years contributed to, any
multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a
"Multiemployer Plan").

 



 

 

(d)  Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination, opinion,
notification or advisory letter, or has pending or has time remaining in
which to file, an application for such determination, opinion or notification
from the Internal Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any reason
why any such determination, opinion, notification or advisory letter should
be revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to Parent
copies of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination, opinion,
notification or advisory letters with respect to each such Employee Plan.
Each Employee Plan has been maintained in material compliance with its terms
and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules
and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to such
Employee Plan. To the Knowledge of the Company, no material events have
occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or
assessment by or against the Company of any material excise taxes under the
Code.

 

 



 

(e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not entitle any employee or independent contractor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance pay or accelerate the time of payment or
vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Employee Plan. There
is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or otherwise) covering any
employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or collectively, would entitle any employee or former employee
to any severance or other payment solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or could give rise to the payment of any amount, that
would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Section 280G or 162(m) of
the Code.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries
except as required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code or as
required by other Applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Since December 31, 2008 there has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by the Company or any
of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, an Employee Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in
respect thereof for

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

38  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, other than as required by Applicable
Law.

 



 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject
to, or is currently negotiating in connection with entering into, any
collective bargaining agreement or equivalent contract or understanding with
a labor union or labor organization.

 



 

(i) All contributions and payments accrued under each Employee Plan,
determined in accordance with prior funding and accrual practices, as
adjusted to include proportional accruals for the period ending as of the
date hereof, have been discharged and paid on or prior to the date hereof
except to the extent reflected as a liability on the Company Balance Sheet.

 



 

(j) There is no material action, suit, investigation, audit or proceeding
pending against or involving or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or involving, any Employee Plan before any Governmental Authority.

 



 

(k) The Company has provided Parent with a list and copies of each
material International Plan, other than International Plans required by
Applicable Laws. Except as is not reasonably likely to result in material
liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, each International Plan
has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all applicable statutes, orders, rules and
regulations (including any special provisions relating to qualified plans
where such Plan was intended so to qualify) and has been maintained in good
standing with applicable regulatory authorities. There has been no amendment
to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any International Plan that would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such International Plan above the level
of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year ended
prior to the date hereof, except as required by Applicable Law. According to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used for the purpose
of funding each International Plan (or, if the same has no such assumptions
and valuations or is unfunded, according to actuarial assumptions and
valuations in use by the PBGC on the date hereof), as of August 31, 2009, the
total amount or value of the funds available under such Plan to pay benefits
accrued thereunder or segregated in respect of such accrued benefits,
together with any reserve or accrual with respect thereto, exceeded the
present value of all benefits (actual or contingent) accrued as of such date
of all participants and past participants therein in respect of which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or would have after the Effective Time
any obligation. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and its Affiliates
will get the full benefit of any such funds, accruals or reserves.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

39  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(l) No employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will become entitled to any bonus, retirement, severance, job security or
similar benefit or enhanced such benefit (including acceleration of vesting
or exercise of an incentive award) solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than any such benefit or enhanced benefit
resulting from actions taken by Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the
Effective Time).

 



 

 

(m) The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Compensation
Committee") has (i) approved each Employee Plan pursuant to which
consideration is payable to any officer, director or employee who is a holder
of any Company Security (each, a "Compensation Arrangement") as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act, and (ii) taken
all other actions necessary or advisable to satisfy the requirements of the
non- exclusive safe harbor with respect to such Compensation Arrangement in
accordance with Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act (the approvals and
actions referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, the "Compensation
Arrangement Approvals"). The Board of Directors has determined that the
Compensation Committee is composed solely of "independent directors" in
accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and
the instructions thereto.

 

 



 

Section 5.18. Environmental Matters. (a) Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect: (i) no notice, notification, demand, request for information,
citation, summons or order has been received, no complaint has been filed, no
penalty has been assessed, and no investigation, action, claim, suit,
proceeding or review (or any basis therefor) is pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, by any Governmental Authority or other Person
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and relating to or arising
out of any Environmental Law; (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries are and
have been in compliance with all Environmental Laws and all Environmental
Permits; and (iii) there are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, arising under or relating to
any Environmental Law or any Hazardous Substance.

 



 

(b)  There has been no written environmental investigation, study, audit,
test, review or other analysis that is material to the environmental
liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of which the Company
has Knowledge in relation to the current or prior business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any property or facility now or previously owned
or leased by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been
delivered or made available to Parent prior to the date hereof.

filings to be made or actions to be taken pursuant to Environmental Laws,

Property Transfer Law" (Sections 22a-134 through 22-134e of the Connecticut
General Statutes).

 

 

(d) For purposes of this Section 5.18, the terms "Company" and "Subsidiaries"
shall include any entity that is, in whole or in part, a predecessor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

Section 5.19. Material Contracts. The Company has made available to Parent a
true and complete copy of each material contract, agreement, license,
consent, arrangement or understanding to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party (each, a "Material Contract"). Except for breaches,
violations or defaults which would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse effect on the Company's ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) each of the Material
Contracts is valid and in full force and effect or has expired pursuant to
its terms and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to
the Company's Knowledge any other party to a Material Contract, has violated
any provision of, or taken or failed to take any act which, with or without
notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default under the
provisions of such Material Contract, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted
under any Material Contract. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is party to any contract, agreement, license, consent, arrangement or
understanding containing any provision or covenant limiting in any material
respect the ability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or, after the
consummation of the Merger, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries) to (i) sell any products or services of or to any
other Person or in any field of distribution, whether defined by geography,
distribution channel, legal jurisdiction, demographic attributes of such
Persons, or other means, (ii) engage in any line of business or (iii) compete
with or to obtain products or services from any Person or limiting the
ability of any Person to provide products or services to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or, after the consummation of the Merger, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries), other than
standard non-competition agreements between the Company and its employees.

Subsidiaries who might be entitled to any fee or commission from the Company
or any of its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41

opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated, financial advisor to the
Company, to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement, the
consideration to be paid pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to the

Section 5.22. Antitakeover Statutes. The Company has taken all action
necessary to exempt the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby from Section 203 of Delaware Law, and,
accordingly, neither such Section nor any other antitakeover or similar
statute or regulation applies or purports to apply to any such transactions.
To the Company's Knowledge, no other "control share acquisition," "fair

purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement unless Delaware Law does

Directors shall recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders
of the Company. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall (i)
promptly prepare and file with the SEC, shall use its reasonable best efforts
to have cleared by the SEC and shall thereafter mail to its stockholders as

Subsidiaries; provided that (A) the Company shall not be required to provide
access to or otherwise make available or furnish any contracts, agreements or
other information governed by a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other
similar agreement in effect as of the date hereof (provided that, in such
event, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make alternative
accommodations to convey the information contained in such information to
Parent in a manner that does not breach or otherwise violate
such confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements), (B) the Company shall not
be required to provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish
any information if and to the extent that the provision of such information
would reasonably be expected to jeopardize any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

attorney-client or other legal privilege (provided that, in such event, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
alternative accommodations to convey the information contained in such
information to Parent in a manner that does not jeopardize such privileges),
(C) the Company shall not be required to provide access to or otherwise make
available or furnish any information regarding employees of the Company if

information contained in such information to Parent in a manner that does not
jeopardize such laws), and (D) the Company shall not be required to provide

Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make
alternative accommodations to convey the information contained in such
information to Parent in a manner that does not violate such laws). Any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall be conducted in such manner as
not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries. No information or Knowledge obtained by Parent in any
investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty made by the Company hereunder.

 



 

Section 7.04. No Solicitation; Other Offers. (a) General
Prohibitions. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, nor
shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its
or their officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants, consultants or other agents or advisors ("Representatives") to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish
any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any
Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the
Company Board Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or take
any action or make any statement inconsistent with the Company Board
Recommendation) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"), (iv) grant any waiver or release under any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class of equity
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) approve any
transaction under, or any Person becoming an "interested stockholder" under,
Section 203 of Delaware Law or (vi) enter into any agreement in principle,
letter of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar instrument relating to an Acquisition Proposal. It
is agreed that any violation of the

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section
by the Company.

 



 

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section 7.04(a), at any time prior to the
Acceptance Date:

 



 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through advisors, agents or
other intermediaries, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with any
Third Party and its Representatives that, subject to the Company's compliance
with Section 7.04(a), has made after the date of this Agreement a bona fide,
written Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors believes in good
faith is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B)
furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided for
informational purposes only to Parent) with such Third Party containing
confidentiality provisions that are no less favorable to the Company than
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood and
hereby agreed that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a
"standstill" or similar provision that prohibits such Third Party from making
any Acquisition Proposals, acquiring Shares or taking any other
action); provided that all such information (to the extent that such
information has not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is
provided or made available to Parent, as the case may be, prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided or made available to
such Third Party;

 



 

(ii) the Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change based
on events, developments, occurrences or changes of circumstances or facts
that arise after the date hereof; and

 



 

(iii) the Company may grant any waiver or release under any "standstill" or
similar agreement with respect to any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

 



 

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) only if
the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Delaware Law.

 



 

In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; provided that any such action taken or statement made
that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action.

 



 

(c) Required Notices. The Board of Directors shall not take any of the
actions referred to in Section 7.04 unless the Company shall have delivered
to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to take such
action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue to advise
Parent on a reasonably current basis of the status and material terms of any
discussions and negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company
shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after
receipt by the Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition
Proposal, any express indication that a Third Party is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,
books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that would reasonably be expected to lead to, result in or facilitate the
making of an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice
orally and in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the
terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or
request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request and shall promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of all correspondence
and written materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that describe any terms or conditions of any
Acquisition Proposal (as well as written summaries of any oral communications
addressing such matters). Any material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal
will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for purposes of the Company's
compliance with this Section 7.04(c).

 



 

(d) "Last Look". Further, the Board of Directors shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal unless
(i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the
Company promptly notifies Parent in writing at least five (5) Business Days
before taking that action of its intention to do so, which notice shall
attach the most current version of the proposed agreement under which the
transaction contemplated by such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated and the identity of the Third Party making the Acquisition
Proposal, and (iii) Parent does not make, within the foregoing five (5)
Business Day period, a binding offer capable of being accepted by the Company
that in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of the Company (in their capacity as such) as
such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the financial terms or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall
require a new written notification from the Company and a new five (5)
Business Day period under this Section 7.04(d)).

 



 

 

(e)  Definition of Superior Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or all or substantially all
of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on terms that
the Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote, after
considering the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel and taking into account all the terms
and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to consummation, are
more favorable to the Company's stockholders (in their capacity as such) than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any
binding offer by Parent capable of being accepted by the Company to amend the
terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.04(d)), and which the Board of
Directors determines is reasonably likely to be consummated and for which
financing, if a cash transaction (whether in whole or in part), is then fully
committed or reasonably available as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors.

 



 

(f) Obligation of the Company to Terminate Existing Discussions. The Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to,
cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request that each Third
Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the
12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration
of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on
behalf of such Person that contain, reflect or analyze that information),
and if and to the extent contemplated by any such confidentiality agreements,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain certifications of
such return or destruction from such other Persons as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof.

 



 

Section 7.05. Compensation Arrangements. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (acting through its Compensation Committee) will take all steps that
may be necessary or advisable to cause each Compensation Arrangement entered
into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof to
be approved by the Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent
directors" determined in the manner described in the last sentence of Section
5.17(m)) as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the 1934 Act and
to satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in
Rule 14d-10(d) of the 1934 Act.

ARTICLE 8

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 



 

Parent agrees that:

 



 

Section 8.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause and enable Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including by providing all funds
necessary to enable Merger Subsidiary to pay for all Shares that Merger
Subsidiary becomes obligated to pay for pursuant to the Offer and all funds
necessary to pay the Merger Consideration that becomes payable upon
consummation of the Merger and all amounts due and payable in respect of
Company Stock Options and Performance Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

Section 8.02. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote all Shares beneficially
owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in favor of adoption of this Agreement
at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



 

Section 8.03. Director and Officer Liability. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the
following:

 



 

(a) For six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless the present and former officers and directors of the Company (each,
an "Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law
or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporation's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability of
directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, subject to
the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), be
permitted to purchase a six-year "tail" or runoff policy under the Company's
directors' and officers' insurance policies and fiduciary

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

liability insurance policies in effect on the date hereof (collectively, the
"DandO Insurance"), provided that the aggregate cost for such "tail" or runoff
policy does not exceed 250% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
for the DandO Insurance (which amount is set forth in Section 8.03(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule). In the event that the Company shall not
purchase such "tail" or runoff policy, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to either (i) continue to maintain in effect for six years after
the Effective Time the DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as those contained in the
Company's DandO Insurance policies in effect as of the date hereof or (ii)
purchase comparable directors' and officers' insurance for such six-year
period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at
least as favorable as those contained in the Company's DandO Insurance policies
in effect as of the date hereof; provided that if the aggregate cost for such
insurance coverage exceeds 250% of the current annual premium paid by the
Company (which amount is set forth in Section 8.03(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain
DandO Insurance with the best available coverage with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate cost of 250% of
the current annual premium.

 



 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.03.

 



 

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 8.03 shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger, are intended to benefit, and shall
be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person (and their heirs and assigns, if
applicable), and shall not be modified in a manner adverse to any Indemnified
Person (or their heirs and assigns, if applicable) without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Person (or their heirs and assigns, if applicable),
it being understood that the Indemnified Persons (and their heirs and
assigns, if applicable) shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
Section 8.03.

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Section 8.04. Employee Matters. Following the Effective Time, Parent will,
subject to Applicable Law, give each employee of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time ("Continuing Employees") full credit for prior service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company
provides such past service credit) for purposes of (i) eligibility and, other
than with respect to a defined benefit plan, vesting under any employee
benefit plans and (ii) determination of benefit levels relating to vacation,
sick, personal time off or severance plans and policies, in each case for
which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the
Continuing Employee is offered participation, except if such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent shall waive, or
cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre- existing
conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under
any comparable plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time and use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize for purposes of
annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental
plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For a period of one
year following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide the Continuing
Employees who are employed by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries during such
period with base salary or base wages, commissions and bonus opportunity and
benefits (other than equity-based compensation) that is in the aggregate at
least substantially equivalent to such base salary or base wages,
commissions, bonus opportunity and benefits as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided that the foregoing shall not require the renewal
of the individual bonus arrangements listed in Section 8.04 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule after the expiration of the bonus arrangements on
December 31, 2009. Within 30 days following the Acceptance Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, implement a retention
bonus program for the benefit of certain Continuing Employees providing for
payment of retention bonuses in the amount (assuming full payout under such
program in accordance with its terms) set forth in Section 8.04 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule.

any other action with respect to any action or proceeding by any Governmental

(b)  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent
and the Company shall make all requisite filings and notifications pursuant
to applicable Antitrust Laws (including an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and appropriate filings
and notifications under the Applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws) with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the

as soon as practicable. Subject to and in furtherance of this Section 9.01,
Parent and Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the

Applicable Laws, with respect to any information which appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than

with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the
transactions contemplated herein. Other than with respect to the Schedule TO,
the Offer Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 (which are addressed by Article
2), Parent and Company shall (i) promptly advise each other of (and Parent or
Company shall so advise with respect to communications received by any
Affiliate of Parent or Company, as the case may be) any written or oral
communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval is or
may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) not participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation, or

opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion, and
(iii) promptly furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and written communications between them and their Subsidiaries and

redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses
of Company, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z)
as necessary to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns.
Neither Parent nor Company shall consent to any voluntary extension of any
statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest
of any Governmental Authority without the consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

and among the Company, the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party
thereto and Regions Bank, as administrative agent (as amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Facility") has not been obtained
so that the consummation of the Offer will not constitute a breach of or
default under the Credit Facility, then Parent shall make appropriate
arrangements to enable the Company to satisfy all outstanding obligations
owed by the Company under the Credit Facility on the Acceptance Date and to
terminate such Credit Facility on the Acceptance Date.

 



 

(d) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the indemnity
obligations of Crimson Acquisition Corp. pursuant to Schedule 7 to the Offer

Merger Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall cooperate with one another (i) in
connection with the preparation of the Company Disclosure Documents and the

or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions,
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to
any material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions
or making any such filings, furnishing information required in connection
therewith or with the Company Disclosure Documents or the Offer Documents and

consult with Parent pursuant to this Section 9.03 in connection with any
actions taken pursuant to Section 7.04(b), including issuing any press
release, having any communication with the press (whether or not for
attribution) or making any other public statement, or scheduling any press
conference or conference call with investors or analysts, provided that the
Company complies with the terms of Section 7.04 in connection therewith.

contained in this Section 12.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and

warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other
representations and warranties of such party that is contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception

the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed.

 



 

(b)   The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document shall only be deemed to be
an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) the Company's or
Parent's representations and warranties, as the case may be, if the relevance
of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of)
such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent to a person
who has read that information concurrently with such representations and
warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part of the reader
regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; provided that in no event shall any
information contained in any part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC
Document entitled "Risk Factors" or containing a description or explanation
of "Forward-Looking Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

representations and warranties of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
contained in this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 8.03,
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 8.03, no provision of

obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

(b)   No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time and, after the Acceptance
Date, to the Offer to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations under the
Offer, enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or
due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or prejudice the rights of tendering
stockholders to receive payment for Shares validly tendered and accepted for
payment pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

Section 12.07. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions contained in
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, without the posting of any
bond, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof in the Delaware Chancery Court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy.

 



 

Section 12.08. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 



 

Section 12.09. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or
against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware
Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and
each of the parties hereby irrevocably

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any
party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 12.01 shall be deemed
effective service of process on such party.

 



 

Section 12.10. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

 



 

Section 12.11. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the
other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall
have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral
or written agreement or other communication).

 



 

Section 12.12. Confidentiality Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of June 16, 2009 by and between
the Company and Parent (as amended by this Section 12.12, the
"Confidentiality Agreement") shall remain in full force and effect from and
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement; provided that upon
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, automatically and without any
action on the part of the parties thereto, Section 12 thereof shall terminate
and be of no further force or effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than by Parent
pursuant to Section 11.01(c)(i) or Section 11.01(c)(ii) or by the Company
pursuant to Section 11.01(d)(i), then automatically and without any action on
the part of the parties thereto, the provisions of Section 12 shall thereupon
become, and thereafter be, effective in accordance with their respective
terms; provided that (i) if a "Significant Event" (as defined in such Section
12) shall occur after the date hereof and prior to any such termination then
such Section 12 shall not become so effective again, and (ii) if the Company
shall enter into a confidentiality agreement after the date hereof and prior
to any such termination of this Agreement and such confidentiality agreement
(a) does not contain a "standstill" or similar provision or (b) contains a
"standstill" or similar provision that is less restrictive (including as a
result of any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

amendment or waiver thereof) than the provisions of such Section 12, then the
Company shall concurrently with entering into such confidentiality agreement
provide Parent with notice of the terms of such less restrictive provisions
and, as applicable, in the case of clause (a), such Section 12 shall not
become so effective again, and in the case of clause (b), the provisions of
such Section 12 shall be deemed to be automatically amended to be equivalent
to such less restrictive provisions.

 



 

Section 12.13. Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 12.14. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.
