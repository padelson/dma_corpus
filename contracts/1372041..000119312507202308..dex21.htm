accordance with the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Seller has determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of Seller

THE MERGER

SECTION 1.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the
DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Seller, at which time the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Seller shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall be a wholly-
owned, direct subsidiary of Buyer (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to and
assume all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
Seller and Merger Sub in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL.

SECTION 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second (2nd) business day after
satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_
(other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it
being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to
the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
at the Closing) at the offices of Hogan and Hartson L.L.P., 8300 Greensboro
Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102, unless another time, date or place is agreed to
in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or otherwise,
neither the Closing nor the Effective Time shall take place or occur prior to
January 10, 2008. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein
as the " _Closing Date_."

SECTION 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger in such
form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions
of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the
Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or, if Buyer and Seller shall otherwise agree, at such subsequent
date or time as Buyer and Seller shall specify in the Certificate of Merger,
which date shall be not more than ninety (90) days after the date the
Certificate of Merger is received for filing. The time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

SECTION 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions
of the DGCL. Buyer and its Subsidiaries hereby disclaim any intention to
subject themselves to any ongoing liabilities or obligations under any
Contract to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, except as may
occur by operation of law as a result of the Merger.

SECTION 1.5. _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.
The certificate of incorporation of Seller, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be amended in its entirety in the Merger to read as
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation
shall continue  



 

-2-  to be McLeodUSA Incorporated, and as so amended, such certificate of
incorporation shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Laws and as provided
in such certificate of incorporation. The bylaws of Seller, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended in their entirety at
the Effective Time to read as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to be McLeodUSA Incorporated, and as so amended,
such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with Applicable Laws and as provided in such bylaws and the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall
have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and Applicable Laws. The officers of
Buyer shall, from and after the Effective Time, become the initial officers of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected,
appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 1.7. _Directors of Buyer at the Effective Time_. As of the Effective
Time, Buyer shall (a) cause the number of directors that shall constitute the
full Board of Directors of Buyer to be increased by one from the number of
directors serving on the Board of Directors of Buyer immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (b) take such action as may be necessary in accordance with
the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Buyer, as amended and currently
in effect (the " _Buyer Charter_ "), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
Buyer, as amended and currently in effect (the " _Buyer Bylaws_ " and,
together with the Buyer Charter, the " _Buyer Organizational Documents_ "), to
cause to be elected or appointed as a Class III director of Buyer, as of the
day immediately following the Closing Date, such individual as shall be
designated by the Wayzata Funds and as shall be reasonably acceptable to
Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a signed counterpart to
the board membership agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit 1.7_ (the " _Board Membership Agreement_ ") which, upon execution by
the Seller Funds, shall be effective as of the Effective Time.

ARTICLE II

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, Seller or the holders of any
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Seller (the "
_Seller Common Stock_ "):

(a) _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_. Each share of Seller Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ and Dissenting
Shares) shall be  



 

-3-  cancelled and converted into the right to receive 1.30 shares of Buyer
Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). The shares of Buyer Common
Stock issuable to holders of Seller Common Stock pursuant hereto are
sometimes referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_." As a result of
the Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of a Certificate shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except that such Certificate shall
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of the shares of Seller Common Stock represented by such Certificate
immediately prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_, all to be issued or paid,
without interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.4(b)_ (or, in the case of a lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, _Section 2.4(i)_).

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and nonassessable share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each share of Seller Common Stock owned by Buyer
or Merger Sub, or held in the treasury of Seller, in each case immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be cancelled pursuant to the Merger, and
no consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock shall
be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares
of Seller Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating all shares of Buyer Common
Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall, upon surrender
of such holders Certificate or Certificates, receive from Buyer an amount of
cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the fractional share interest (after aggregating all shares of
Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) which such
holder would otherwise receive, multiplied by (ii) the closing price of one
share of Buyer Common Stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (" _NASDAQ_ ") on
the trading day which is one (1) trading day prior to the Closing Date.

(e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. The Exchange Ratio, the Merger
Consideration and any amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section
2.4(c)_ shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any
stock split, split-up, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Seller Common Stock or
Buyer Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or
other similar change with respect to Seller Common Stock or Buyer Common Stock
having a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(a)_,
each share of Seller Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded appraisal for such share of Seller Common Stock in accordance  



 

-4-  with the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid with
respect to such share of Seller Common Stock, pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_,
unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holders right to appraisal, but shall be converted into the right to receive
such amounts as may be determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 of the
DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal, such Dissenting Share shall
be treated as if it had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid with respect to such share
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Seller shall give Buyer prompt notice and a
copy of any notice of any demands received by Seller for appraisal of shares
of Seller Common Stock and Buyer shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall not make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

SECTION 2.2. _Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, without any further
action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, Seller or any holder of any shares of
restricted Seller Common Stock granted under the Seller 2006 Plan (the "
_Restricted Stock_ ") (whether vested or unvested) outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each share of Restricted Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, in respect of each underlying share of
Seller Common Stock, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.1(a)_.

SECTION 2.3. _Stock Options; Stock Option Agreements_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding option to purchase Seller
Common Stock (a " _Seller Option_ ") granted under the Seller 2006 Plan,
whether or not vested or exercisable at the Effective Time, shall be assumed
by Buyer and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as the terms and conditions that were applicable to such Seller
Option, the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Seller Common Stock subject to such Seller Option multiplied by (B) the
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Buyer Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1)
the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Seller Common Stock subject to
such Seller Option by (2) the aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
to be subject to such Seller Option after giving effect to the adjustments in
this _Section 2.3(a)_ (each, as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ "). In
furtherance of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, Buyer shall assume the
Seller 2006 Plan with respect to the Adjusted Options outstanding under the
Seller 2006 Plan following the Effective Time. Buyer may elect to make
additional grants of awards for Buyer Common Stock under the Seller 2006 Plan
to Continuing Employees.

(b) The adjustments provided in _Section 2.3(a)_ shall be and are intended
to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the
Code. Except to the extent required under the respective terms of the Adjusted
Options or as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.3(b)_, all restrictions
or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to such Adjusted Options
to the extent that such restrictions or limitations shall have not already
lapsed in accordance with their respective terms, and all other terms
thereof, shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such Adjusted
Options after giving effect to the Merger and the  



 

-5-  assumption by Buyer set forth in _Section 2.3(a)_. Any holder of Seller
Options vesting pursuant to the Merger who gives proper notice of
exercise thereof and properly exercises such Seller Options prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to have exercised such Seller Options
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the shares of Seller Common Stock
issuable to such holder in connection with such exercise of such Seller
Options shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller shall take all corporate action
necessary, including, to the extent necessary, amending the Seller 2006 Plan
and any relevant award agreements thereunder, to effectuate the provisions of
this _Section 2.3_ effective as of the Effective Time.

(d) Reasonably promptly following the Effective Time, Buyer shall (i) issue to
each holder of an Adjusted Option, a writing (which may be in electronic form)
evidencing the foregoing assumption of such Adjusted Option and (ii) issue
appropriate notices (which may be in electronic form) setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the Adjusted Options, including the effect of the
Merger on such Adjusted Options. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
shall take such actions as are necessary for the assumption of the Seller
2006 Plan and the Adjusted Options pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_. Subject to
receiving full cooperation from Seller and its independent registered public
accounting firm, as soon as is commercially reasonable after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall file with the SEC a registration statement on an appropriate
form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously
filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the shares of Buyer Common
Stock subject to the Adjusted Options and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to have such registration statement or post-effective amendment
declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time.

SECTION 2.4. _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Not less than three (3) business days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall engage an institution reasonably satisfactory to
Seller (the transfer agent from time to time of Buyer Common Stock being
deemed satisfactory to Seller) to act as exchange agent in connection with the
Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At such times which shall be sufficient to
comply with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.4(b)_, Buyer shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of
Seller Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, certificates
representing the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_.
In addition, Buyer shall make available by depositing with the Exchange Agent,
as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, cash in an amount
sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions to which former holders
of shares of Seller Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to  _Section
2.4(c)_. All cash and certificates representing shares of Buyer Common Stock
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. From and after the Effective Time, each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates (" _Certificates_ ") which
represented shares of Seller Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, in order to receive the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect of such shares of Seller Common Stock, shall surrender each
Certificate to  



 

-6-  the Exchange Agent along with (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery of the Merger Consideration shall be effected, and
that risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller) and (ii) other
appropriate materials and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the aggregate Merger Consideration that such
holder has a right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, cash in an amount
sufficient to make the payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions to which former
holders of shares of Seller Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to _Section
2.4(c)_. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent (the " _Surrender Date_
"), the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Surrender Date, (i) the
number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates surrendered by such holder) to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (which shall be in uncertificated book entry form
unless a physical certificate is issued by Buyer), (ii) payment of cash in
lieu of fractional shares which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_ and (iii) any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)_, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Seller Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Seller, a certificate
representing the proper number of shares of Buyer Common Stock may be issued
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered
is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such issuance shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of
Buyer Common Stock to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
_Section 2.4(b)_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(and any amounts to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section
2.4(c)_) upon such surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any
amount payable pursuant to this _Article II_. Buyer and Seller agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to work with the Exchange Agent prior to the
Closing Date to create a process acceptable to each of Buyer, Seller and the
Exchange Agent to allow each holder of Seller Common Stock who complies with
the terms and conditions of this _Section 2.4(b)_ (including the delivery of
Certificates with a duly executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent)
to receive the Merger Consideration owing to such holder as promptly as is
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Buyer Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, until such Certificate has been
surrendered in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to Applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be delivered to the
recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)_, together  



 

-7-  with any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Common Stock_. All shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ and any cash paid pursuant to
_Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.4(c)_ shall be deemed to have been issued (or
paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Seller
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates. As of the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Seller shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Seller Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this _Article II_.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates one (1) year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Buyer, upon demand, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Buyer for delivery of their claim for Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends
or distributions pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_.

(f) _No Liability_. None of Buyer, Merger Sub, Seller or the Exchange Agent
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a Governmental
Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to seven (7) years
after the Effective Time, or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any portion of the Exchange Fund or any dividends or distributions with
respect to Buyer Common Stock issuable in respect of such Certificate would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate
shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Buyer from time to time, 
_provided_ , that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the Stockholders after the Effective Time pursuant to this _Article
II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become
a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
pursuant to this _Article II_ shall promptly be paid to Buyer.



 

-8- (h) _Withholding Rights_. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person who was a holder of Seller Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time such amounts as Buyer or the Exchange Agent may be required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any other provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or the Exchange Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have
been paid. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer and the
Exchange Agent shall have the right to require any Person to pay to Buyer
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, an amount of cash equal to the
withholding Tax (including, but subject to the provisions of _Section 5.15_,
withholding Tax under Section 1445(a) of the Code) imposed with respect to the
Seller Common Stock acquired from such Person prior to, and as a condition
to, the transfer to such Person of the Merger Consideration.

(i)  _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger Consideration as
may be required pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, cash for fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to  _Section 2.4(c)_; _provided_ , that Buyer may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver either (i) an
agreement of indemnification in a form satisfactory to Buyer and the Exchange
Agent or (ii) a bond in such sum as Buyer or the Exchange Agent may reasonably
direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Buyer or the
Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

SECTION 2.5. _Certain Tax Matters_. For federal income tax purposes, the
Merger is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this
Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections
1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations with
respect to the Merger. Neither Buyer nor Seller has taken or shall take any
action, or has failed to take or shall fail to take any action, either before
or after the Closing, which could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger
to fail to qualify as a reorganization. Except as required by Applicable Laws,
each party hereto shall report the Merger for federal income tax purposes
consistent with such intended tax treatment, and, as of the date hereof, the
parties believe that such reporting shall be consistent with such intended tax
treatment.

in the disclosure schedule dated as of the date hereof and delivered by Seller
to Buyer concurrently with or prior to the execution and delivery by Seller
of this Agreement, which shall make reference to the particular section or
subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken (it being
agreed that any information disclosed in one section of such disclosure
schedule shall be deemed to apply to each other section thereof to which its
relevance is reasonably apparent) (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "),
Seller represents and warrants to Buyer and Merger Sub as follows:

Subsidiaries_.

(i) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of Seller and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly

or otherwise organized and each has the requisite corporate (or
similar) power and authority and all necessary government approvals to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to have such
power, authority or government approvals and to be so organized, existing or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect on Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (a " _Seller
Material Adverse Effect_ "). Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions which recognize such concept) in each jurisdiction in which the
nature or conduct of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of
its properties makes such qualification, licensing or good standing necessary,
except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or to be in good standing would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) _Charter Documents_. Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer
complete and correct copies of (A) the Third Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation of Seller, as amended and currently in effect (the " _Seller
Charter_ "), and the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws of Seller, as amended
and currently in effect (the " _Seller Bylaws_ ," and, together with the
Seller Charter, the " _Seller Organizational Documents_ ") and (B) the
articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws or like organizational
documents of each of the Subsidiaries of Seller, as amended and currently in
effect (collectively, the " _Seller Subsidiary Organizational Documents_ "),
and each such instrument is in full force and effect. Seller is not in
violation of the Seller Organizational Documents and no Subsidiary of Seller
is in violation of its Seller Subsidiary Organizational Documents. Seller has
made available to Buyer complete and accurate minute books of Seller and its
Subsidiaries.

directly or indirectly by Seller and, except as disclosed in _Section

enter into this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Agreements, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions

validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller,

with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally and to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) (collectively, "
_Creditors  Laws_"). Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery
at Closing of the Seller Ancillary Agreements by the counterparties thereto,
the Seller Ancillary Agreements shall constitute the legal, valid and binding
obligations of Seller, enforceable against Seller in accordance with their

effective date of the Written Consents.

or approval of any Governmental Entity, and no declaration or notice to or
filing or registration with any Governmental Entity or any other Person is
required to be made, obtained, performed or given with respect to Seller or

Subsidiaries is subject to periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act. Prior to the date hereof, Seller has filed with the SEC a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-141586) and a Registration
Statement on Form S-1 (Registration Statement No. 333-141490) including, in
each case, all exhibits and the most recently filed amendments thereto (each
such Registration Statement, as most recently amended prior to the date
hereof, the " _Seller SEC Documents_ "). As of the date hereof, the Seller
SEC Documents (including the financial statements of Seller included in the
Seller SEC Documents) complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, applicable to
such Seller SEC Documents, and none of the Seller SEC Documents, when filed,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading. As of the date hereof, neither of the
Seller SEC Documents has been declared effective by the SEC.

(i) Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of (A) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of June
30, 2007, and (B) the related unaudited statements of income and cash flows
for the quarterly period ended as of such date (the " _Seller Unaudited
Financial Statements_ "). Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete
copies of (A) the audited consolidated balance sheets of Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and (B) the
related audited statements of cash flows and the related audited statements of
income for the applicable periods ending on such dates (the " _Seller Audited
Financial Statements_ ," and together with the Seller Unaudited Financial
Statements, the " _Seller Financial Statements_ ").



 

-14- (ii) The (A) Seller Financial Statements, (B) the financial statements
of Seller included in the Seller SEC Documents and (C) the financial
statements of Seller required to be provided to Buyer pursuant to _Section
4.3_ (the " _Subsequent Seller Financial Statements_ ") have been or (in
the case of the Subsequent Seller Financial Statements) shall be prepared
from the books and records of Seller and its Subsidiaries, and fairly present
or (in the case of the Subsequent Seller Financial Statements) shall fairly
present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Seller and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended or ending in accordance with GAAP (subject, in the case of the Seller
Unaudited Financial Statements and Subsequent Seller Financial Statements for
interim fiscal periods, to normal year-end audit adjustments which are not
material and lack of footnote disclosure). The financial books and records of
Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, are true and correct in all
material respects.

(iii) Except as reflected or reserved against in the balance sheet of Seller,
dated June 30, 2007 (including the notes thereto, the " _Seller Balance Sheet_
__"), and except as disclosed in _Section 3.1(d)(iii)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, known
or unknown, contingent or otherwise) nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, does any
basis exist therefor, other than liabilities or obligations that (A) were
incurred since June 30, 2007 in the Ordinary Course of Business and,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had a Seller Material Adverse
Effect, (B) individually or in the aggregate, otherwise have not had a Seller
Material Adverse Effect or (C) were incurred pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP, (B) that transactions are executed only
in accordance with the authorization of management and (C) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Sellers assets. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no
"material weaknesses" (as defined by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board) or series of multiple "significant deficiencies" (as defined by the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) that are reasonably likely to
collectively represent a "material weakness" in the design or operation of
Sellers internal control over financial reporting.

(v) _Section 3.1(d)(v)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true
and complete list of all Indebtedness of Seller and any of its Subsidiaries as
of the date hereof.

Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Buyer in connection with the issuance of
Buyer Common Stock in the Merger (including any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Form S-4_ ") shall, at the time the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading or (ii) the
proxy statement relating to the Buyer Stockholders Meeting (such proxy
statement, together with the prospectus relating to the registration and

Stockholders or Buyer Stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 3.1(e)_, no representation or
warranty is made by Seller with respect to information or statements made in
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus which were not supplied by or
on behalf of Seller for use therein.

of any material services or products.

benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries (the foregoing, without regard to materiality, the "
_Seller Benefit Plans_ "). With respect to the Seller Benefit Plans, no event
has occurred, and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, which,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither Seller nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of Seller, any other Person, has any
express commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to modify, change or
terminate any Seller Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a modification,
change or termination required by or to ensure compliance with ERISA or the
Code, or any other Applicable Laws or administrative changes that do not
increase the liabilities or obligations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such plans. None of the Seller Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV
or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code nor has Seller or any of
its ERISA Affiliates incurred nor does Seller or any of its ERISA Affiliates
reasonably expect to incur any liability pursuant to Title IV of ERISA,

administered and operated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Laws,
including but not limited to ERISA and the Code. Each Seller Benefit Plan
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is
so qualified and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, no
condition exists that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such
qualification. Each Seller Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been
maintained and administered in good faith compliance with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and any regulations or other guidance issued
thereunder.

(iv) No written or, to the Knowledge of Seller, oral representation
or commitment with respect to any material aspect of any Seller Benefit Plan
has been made on behalf of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their
respective Affiliates to an employee or former employee of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries by an authorized Seller employee that is not materially in
accordance with the written or otherwise pre-existing terms and provisions of
such Seller Benefit Plan.

(v) There are no unresolved claims or disputes under the terms of, or in
connection with, any Seller Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for

(vi) No Seller Benefit Plan provides health benefits (whether or not insured)
with respect to employees or former employees of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries after retirement or other termination of service, other than
coverage mandated by Applicable Laws or benefits the full cost of which is
borne by the employee or former employee.

(vii) Neither the negotiation and execution of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall (either alone or
upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events) constitute an
event under any Seller Benefit Plan that shall or may result in any payment
(whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness
of indebtedness, vesting (or acceleration or continuation thereof),
distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits
with respect to any employee or former employee of Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or limit the ability to amend or terminate any Seller Benefit
Plan or related trust. There is no Contract with an employee or former
employee of Seller to which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as
of the date of this Agreement that, individually or collectively and as a
result of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or upon the
occurrence of any additional or subsequent events), could give rise to the
payment of any amount that would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of

following actions prior to the applicable Superior Proposal Termination Date
(but only (1) if and to the extent that (y) its Board of Directors concludes
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the

following actions and (2) if it shall not have breached in any material
respect any of the provisions of this  _Section 4.2_):

(i) Furnish nonpublic information to the Person or group of Persons making
such Superior Proposal, _provided_ , that (A) prior to furnishing any such
nonpublic information, it receives from such Person or group of Persons an
executed  



 

-43-  confidentiality and standstill agreement containing terms at least as
restrictive as the terms contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement, dated July
23, 2007, between Buyer and Seller (the " _CDA_ _")_ and (B)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person or group of Persons, it furnishes such nonpublic information to the
other party hereto (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously so furnished to such party); and

(ii) Engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or group of
Persons with respect to such Superior Proposal.

(d) Prior to the applicable Superior Proposal Termination Date, solely in
response to the receipt of an unsolicited, bona fide written Alternative

the applicable Superior Proposal Termination Date, the Board of Directors of

state expressly that it intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and shall include
the most current version of such agreement (or a description of all material
terms and conditions thereof) and (3) during the aforementioned period, if
requested by the other party, engaged in good faith negotiations so that the
other party is able to make a revised proposal to amend this Agreement in such
a manner that the Alternative Transaction Proposal which was determined to be
a Superior Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal; 

(iii) Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, does not make, within two (2)
business days of receipt of the other partys written notification of its
intention to enter into a binding agreement for such Superior Proposal, an
offer that the Board of Directors of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
determines, in good faith after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, is at least as favorable to the Stockholders
or the Buyer Stockholders, as the case may be, as the Superior Proposal, it
being understood that Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not enter
into any such binding agreement during such two (2) business day period;

(iv) the Board of Directors of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the failure of the Board of
Directors to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a breach
of its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Applicable Laws; and



 

-44- (v) Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall not have breached in any
material respect any of the provisions set forth in this _Section 4.2_.

Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, so that any of such documents would not
include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed

counsel, determines in good faith that such action is necessary for Buyers
Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Laws.

Governmental Entities, which would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect after the

under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement to the extent required by Applicable Laws or by

Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Seller Notes Trustee

Employees_ "), compensation and employee benefits (the " _Post-Closing
Benefits_ ") that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the compensation
and employee benefits to which such Continuing Employee is entitled
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the Seller Benefit Plans (the "
_Pre-Closing Benefits_ "). Nothing herein shall limit the right of Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee
at any time or require Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to provide any such

benefit accrual under the Post-Closing Benefits; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Continuing Employees be entitled to any credit (A)
for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit retirement plan, (B)

of such program is not given to a similarly situated employee of Buyer or (C)
to the extent that such credit would result in duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service, (ii) cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods, active employment
requirements and requirements to show evidence of good health under the Post-
Closing Benefits, to the extent that such conditions, exclusions and waiting

Benefits in which such Continuing Employees participated immediately prior to
the Closing Date, to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employees and
such Continuing Employees spouses and eligible dependents who become
participants in the Post-Closing Benefits and (iii) give credit for or
otherwise take into account under the Post-Closing Benefits the out-of-pocket
expenses and annual expense limitation amounts paid by Continuing Employees
under the analogous Pre-Closing Benefits for the year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

(c) Seller agrees that, after written notice by Buyer given no later than
fifteen (15) business days prior to the Closing Date, which notice shall
include executed copies of such actions as may be reasonably necessary to
ensure that the Continuing Employees shall participate in a qualified
retirement plan of Buyer meeting the requirements of Section 401(k) of the
Code immediately following the Closing Date on terms consistent with this 
_Section 5.11_, Sellers Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions
terminating, effective at least two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, any

forth on  _Section 5.12(b)_ of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule to deliver to
Buyer, immediately after the execution hereof, a written agreement

Up Letter_ __").

untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or
warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement that is not qualified as to

to the provisions of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.445-2(c)(3) with respect
to any Person who is a holder of Seller Common Stock at the Effective Time. If
Seller does not deliver such certification and notice, Buyer and Exchange
Agent are entitled to deduct and withhold (pursuant to _Section 2.4(h)_) Tax
under Section 1445(a) of the Code except to the extent that withholding is not

committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term is defined
for purposes of Rule 16b-3(b)(3) under the Exchange Act), shall adopt a
resolution before the Effective Time providing that the acquisition by any
Stockholder, who shall become or have a right to designate a director of Buyer
as of the day immediately following the Closing Date, of Buyer Common Stock

further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this Agreement which
by Applicable Laws requires the further approval of such stockholders. This
Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto and duly approved by the parties
respective Boards of Directors or a duly designated committee thereof.

for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance by any other
party hereto with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. Any extension or waiver given in compliance with this
_Section 7.4_ or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the

provisions set forth in _Section 5.5_ (which are intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties, including Indemnified Parties who or which are not
parties hereto), nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer upon any
Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

SECTION 8.8. _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any disputes arising out of
or related to this Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws thereof.

SECTION 8.9. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,

any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced,  



 

-72-  the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so

failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right
hereunder shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or
acquiescence in, any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement

Form of Affiliate Letter

PAETEC Holding Corp.

One PAETEC Plaza

600 Willowbrook Office Park

Fairport, New York 14450

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of McLeodUSA Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (" _Seller_ "),
as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations (the " _Rules and Regulations_ ") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Act_ "). I have been further
advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of September 17, 2007 (as it may be amended from time to time, the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), by and among PAETEC Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), Seller and PS Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub_ "),
Merger Sub will merge with and into Seller, pursuant to which merger each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Seller will be converted
into the right to receive 1.30 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "). All terms used in this
letter (the " _Letter Agreement_ ") but not defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.

I represent and warrant to, and covenant with, the Company that in the event I
receive any Company Common Stock as a result of the Merger:

I shall not publicly offer or sell (any such transaction, a " _Transfer_ ")
any Company Common Stock I acquire in connection with the Merger (the "
_Merger Shares_ ") in violation of the Act or the Rules and Regulations.

I have carefully read this Letter Agreement and reviewed its requirements and
other applicable limitations upon my ability to Transfer Merger Shares with my
counsel or with counsel for Seller to the extent I have considered such
review necessary.

I have been advised that the issuance of Company Common Stock to me pursuant
to the Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised that,
since at the time the Merger was submitted for consent by the stockholders of
Seller I may be deemed to have been an affiliate of Seller and the Transfer
   by me of the Merger Shares has not been registered under the Act, I may not
Transfer Merger Shares unless (i) such Transfer has been registered under the
Act, (ii) such Transfer is made in conformity with the volume and other
limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Act or (iii)
in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Company, or as
described in a letter from the staff of the Commission specifically issued
with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, such
Transfer is otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.

I understand that the Company is under no obligation to register the Transfer
of Merger Shares by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take any
other action necessary in order to make compliance with an exemption from
such registration available.

I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to the
Companys transfer agent with respect to Company Common Stock and that there
will be placed on the certificates for Merger Shares, or any substitutions
therefor, a legend (the " _Restrictive Legend_ ") stating in substance as
follows:

"The securities represented by this certificate have been issued in a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies and may only be sold, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in
compliance with the requirements of Rule 145 or pursuant to a registration
statement under such Act or an exemption from such registration."

I also understand that, for so long as the requirements of Rule 145 shall
apply to such Transfer, unless the Transfer by me of Merger Shares has been
registered under the Act or is a Transfer made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145, the Company reserves the right to put the following
legend on the certificates for Merger Shares issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this certificate were acquired from a person who
received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares may not be sold, transferred,
pledged or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to a registration statement
under the Securities Act of 1933 or in accordance with an exemption from the
registration requirements of such Act."

I understand and agree that the Restrictive Legend shall be removed, at
no cost to me, by delivery of substitute certificates without the Restrictive
Legend, and/or the issuance of a letter to the Companys transfer agent
removing such stop transfer instructions, and that the foregoing restrictions
on Transfer shall cease to apply, if (i) one year (or such other period as
may be required by Rule 145(d)(2) under the Act or any successor thereto)
shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the provisions of such Rule are
then available to me, (ii) two years (or such other period as may be required
by Rule 145(d)(3) under the Act or any  



 

2  successor thereto) shall have elapsed from the Closing Date and the
provisions of such Rule are then available to me, or (iii) I shall have
delivered to the Company (A) a copy of a letter from the staff of the
Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, to the effect that the Restrictive Legend and/or stop transfer
instructions are not required for purposes of the Act or (B) reasonably
satisfactory evidence or representations that the securities represented by
such certificates are being or have been Transferred in a transaction made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under the Act or pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Act.

I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to shares
acquired in connection with the Merger and held by (i) my spouse, (ii) any
relative of mine or my spouse occupying my home, (iii) any trust or estate
in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least a 10% beneficial
interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar
capacity and (iv) any corporate or other organization in which I, my spouse or
any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or of
the equity interest. Attached as _Schedule 1_ to this Letter Agreement are the
names of each of the Persons to which the provisions of this Letter Agreement
shall apply (consisting of myself and each of the other Persons described in
the preceding sentence).

The Company agrees that for so long as the Company is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15 of the Exchange Act and,
subject to the foregoing, for so long as and to the extent necessary to permit
the undersigned to sell the Company Common Stock to be received in the
Merger pursuant to Rule 145 and, to the extent applicable, Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to file,
on a timely basis, all reports required to be filed with the Commission by it
pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15 of the Exchange Act, and will furnish to
the undersigned upon written request a written statement as to whether the
Company has filed all such reports during the twelve months preceding any
proposed sale under Rule 145. The Company has filed all reports required to
be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or Section 15 of the
Exchange Act during the preceding twelve months (or for such shorter period
that the Company was required to file such reports). The Company further
agrees that, if at any time during which this Letter Agreement is in effect,
the Commission shall adopt and make effective amendments to Rule 145 that have
the effect of eliminating the foregoing restrictions on Transfers of Merger
Shares, the foregoing restrictions on such Transfers shall cease to apply and
upon my request the Restrictive Legend shall be removed from the certificates
for the Merger Shares, at no cost to me, by delivery of
substitute certificates without the Restrictive Legend, and the Company shall
issue a letter to the Companys transfer agent removing the foregoing stop
transfer instructions.

Execution of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission on
my part that I am an "affiliate" of Seller as described in the first paragraph
of this Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to
any claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this Letter
Agreement.



 

3 This Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect if
the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

Form of Lock-Up Letter

PAETEC Holding Corp.

One PAETEC Plaza

600 Willowbrook Office Park

Fairport, New York 14450

September 17, 2007

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among PAETEC Holding Corp., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), McLeodUSA Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation (" _Seller_ "), and PS Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub_ "), Merger Sub
will merge with and into Seller, pursuant to which merger each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Seller will be converted into the
right to receive the cash consideration specified in the Merger Agreement and
1.30 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "
_Company Common Stock_ "). All terms used in this letter (the " _Letter
Agreement_ ") but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such
terms in the Merger Agreement.

 

1\. _Restrictions on Transfers of Seller Common Stock_. The undersigned
understands that for tax purposes it is important, and is a
material inducement for the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, that
there not be an ownership change of Seller prior to Closing. Accordingly, the
undersigned hereby agrees that from the date hereof until the earlier of (a)
the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms or (b)
the consummation of the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of Seller Common Stock or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any Seller
Common Stock, enter into a transaction which would have the same effect, or
enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or
in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of Seller Common Stock,
whether any such aforementioned transaction is to be settled by delivery of
Seller Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or
publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge or
disposition, or to enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other
arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written consent of the Company.
Without limiting the foregoing, the undersigned shall not take any action
that would change the ownership for purposes of Section 382 of the Code of the
shares of Seller Common Stock that the undersigned holds on the date hereof.

2\. _Restrictions on Transfers of Company Common Stock_. For the avoidance of
doubt, the following subsections (a) through (e) shall apply with respect to
the undersigneds shares of Company Common Stock received in the Merger, but
shall not apply to the undersigneds shares of Seller Common Stock: (a) The undersigned hereby further agrees with the Company that, during the
period ending 90 days after the Closing Date (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), the
undersigned will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise
dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Company Common Stock or securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any Company Common Stock,
enter into a transaction which would have the same effect, or enter into any
swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of the Company Common Stock, whether
any such aforementioned transaction is to be settled by delivery of the
Company Common Stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise, or
publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, pledge
or disposition, or to enter into any such transaction, swap, hedge or other
arrangement, without, in each case, the prior written consent of the Company.

(b) Any Company Common Stock received by the undersigned upon exercise of
stock options granted to the undersigned will also be subject to this Letter
Agreement. Any Company Common Stock acquired by the undersigned in open
market transactions will not be subject to this Letter Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the undersigned may transfer Company
Common Stock without the prior written consent of the Company as follows:



     | (i) | as a _bona fide_ gift or gifts, provided that the donee or
donees thereof agree to be bound in writing by the restrictions set forth
herein; 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | as dispositions, other than dispositions for value, that
are made exclusively between and among the undersigned and members of the
undersigneds immediate family, or the undersigneds partners (if the
undersigned is a partnership), or the undersigneds members (if the
undersigned is a limited liability company) or to an affiliate of the
undersigned, or to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of
the undersigned or the immediate family of the undersigned, _provided_ , in
each of the foregoing instances, that the transferee (or the trustee in the
event of a transfer to a trust) agrees to be bound in writing by the

Registration Rights Provisions

Buyer is party to that certain registration rights agreement, dated as of
February 28, 2007, among Buyer, PAETEC Corp and the stockholder parties
thereto (the " _Old Registration Rights Agreement_ ").

Pursuant to the New Registration Rights Agreement, Buyer shall grant the
following registration rights to Fidelity Advisor Series II: Fidelity Advisor
High Income Advantage Fund, Pension Investment Committee of General Motors
for General Motors Employees Domestic Group Pension Trust, Fidelity Security
Fund: Fidelity Leveraged Company Stock Fund, Commonwealth of Massachusetts
Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, and Fidelity Advisor Series
I: Fidelity Advisor Leveraged Company Stock Fund (the " _Fidelity Funds_ ")
and Wayzata Opportunities Fund, LLC, Wayland Distressed Opportunities Fund
I-C, LLC, Wayzata Recovery Fund, LLC, Wayland Distressed Opportunities Fund
I-B, LLC, and Wayzata Opportunities Fund Offshore, L.P. (the " _Wayzata
Funds_ ") with respect to the shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the
Merger to the Fidelity Funds and the Wayzata Funds, respectively, and any
shares of Buyer Common Stock issued by way of a stock dividend or other
distribution on such shares of Buyer Common Stock issued in the Merger (the "
_Registrable Common Shares_ ").

1\. _Fidelity Funds Demand Registration Right_. Following the expiration of
the 90-day lock-up period under the Lock-Up Letter, the Fidelity Funds shall
be entitled to one demand registration for the registration of their
Registrable Common Shares with a minimum value of $35 million at the time of
such exercise (as determined in good faith by Buyers Board of Directors)
until the Fidelity Funds collectively cease to beneficially own Registrable
Common Shares representing at least 50% of the Registrable Common Shares
issued to the Fidelity Funds in the Merger. The Fidelity Funds shall not have
been deemed to have exercised their demand registration unless 75% of the
Registrable Common Shares requested to be included in any such demand
registration are so included.

2\. _Wayzata Funds Demand Registration Right_. Following the expiration of the
90-day lock-up period under the Lock-Up Letter, the Wayzata Funds shall be
entitled to one demand registration of their Registrable Common Shares with
a minimum value of $35 million at the time of such exercise (as determined in
good faith by Buyers Board of Directors) until the Wayzata Funds collectively
cease to beneficially own Registrable Common Shares representing at least 50%
of the Registrable Common Shares issued to the Wayzata Funds in the Merger.
The Wayzata Funds shall not have been deemed to have exercised their demand
registration unless 75% of the Registrable Common Shares requested to be
included in any such demand registration are so included.

3\. _Piggyback Registration Rights_. The Fidelity Funds and the Wayzata Funds
shall each have piggyback registration rights with respect to the exercise of
a demand registration pursuant to the New Registration Rights Agreement. The
New Registration Rights Agreement shall not provide for any other piggyback
registration rights. 4\. _Shelf Registration Statement_. Buyer shall be obligated to file a shelf
registration statement covering the Registrable Common Shares of the Fidelity
Funds and of the Wayzata Funds on or before May 15, 2008 if, at such date,
Buyer is then eligible to file such shelf registration statement on Form S-3.
If Buyer is not then eligible to use Form S-3, it shall be obligated to file
such shelf registration statement as soon as reasonably practicable after
Buyer becomes so eligible. The right of the Fidelity Funds or the Wayzata
Funds, as applicable, to sell their Registrable Common Shares pursuant to an
effective shelf registration statement shall terminate upon the first to occur
of (i) 15 months after the Closing Date, (ii) the date that is 90 days
following the date on which the Fidelity Funds or the Wayzata Funds,
as applicable, cease to beneficially own Registrable Common Shares
representing at least 50% of the Registrable Common Shares issued to the
Fidelity Funds or the Wayzata Funds, as applicable, in the Merger, and (iii)
the date on which the Fidelity Funds or the Wayzata Funds, as the case may
be, otherwise are able to sell all of their Registrable Common Shares within
any three-month period without limitation by the volume restrictions of Rule
144 under the Securities Act. Buyer shall receive prior notice of any
proposed sales pursuant to the shelf registration statement.

5\. _Other Provisions_. The exercise of the foregoing registration rights
shall be subject to customary limitations, qualifications and conditions,
which shall be substantially similar to the limitations, qualifications and
conditions applicable to the holders of registration rights under the
Old Registration Rights Agreement. In any demand registration involving an
underwritten offering, Buyer shall have the right to designate the managing
underwriter of such offering, so long as such managing underwriter is
reasonably satisfactory to the parties exercising their demand registration
rights (it being agreed that Merrill Lynch and Co. and Deutsche Bank Securities
shall be acceptable to the Fidelity Funds and the Wayzata Funds). The Fidelity
Funds and the Wayzata Funds shall be entitled to withdraw from the New
Registration Rights Agreement at their sole election.
