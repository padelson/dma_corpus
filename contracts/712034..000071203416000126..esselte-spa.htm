necessary to make it valid and enforceable. 

| 
---|--- 

13.4

|

Without prejudice to Clause 13.3, if any undertaking in this Clause 13 is
found by any court or other competent authority to be void or unenforceable

The Purchaser Guarantor as primary obligor (and not as a surety)
unconditionally and irrevocably:

(a)

|

guarantees by way of continuing guarantee to the Vendor the due and punctual
performance by the Purchaser of its obligations under or pursuant to this
Agreement; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

agrees that if and each time that the Purchaser fails to make any payment when

this Agreement or any right, guarantee, remedy or security from or against the
Purchaser or any other person; or 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

any unenforceability or invalidity of any obligation of the Purchaser, so that
this Clause 14 shall be construed as if there were no such unenforceability or
invalidity, 

provided that, nothing in this Clause 14.4 shall give rise to the Purchaser
Guarantor's obligations under this Clause 14 extending beyond the Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement (as affected by any such matter or thing).

|

|

No variation or amendment of this Agreement shall be valid unless it is in
writing and duly executed by or on behalf of all of the parties to this

provision shall be deemed to be severed from this Agreement and, if possible,

that shall not affect or impair the legality, validity or enforceability in
that, or any other, jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement.

|

ASSIGNMENT 

| 
---|--- 

22.1

|

Except as provided in this Clause 22 or as the parties specifically agree in

or any of its rights under this Agreement nor grant, declare, create or
dispose of any right or interest in it. 

| 
---|--- 

22.2

|

Subject to Clause 22.3, the Purchaser or the Vendor may assign the benefit of
this Agreement and/or of any other Transaction Document to which it is a
party, in whole or in part, to, and it may be enforced by: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any member of the Purchaser Group in the case of the Purchaser, or the Vendor
Group in the case of the Vendor; and 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

in the case of the Purchaser, any bank or financial institution lending money
or making other banking facilities available to the Purchaser (or one of the
members of the Purchaser's Group) to fund (i) the acquisition of the Shares,
(ii) the refinancing of the existing indebtedness of the Group, or (iii)
capital expenditure, acquisitions and general working capital of the Group. 

Any such person to whom an assignment is made under this Clause 22.2 may
itself make an assignment as if it were the Purchaser or Vendor under this
Clause 22.2.

| 
---|--- 

22.3

|

Any assignment made pursuant to this Clause 22 shall be on the basis that: 

 

41

EU-DOCS\\\16547119.1

* * *



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the non-assigning party may discharge its obligations under this Agreement to
the assignor until it receives notice of the assignment; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the liability of the non-assigning party to any assignee shall not be greater
than its liability to the assignor; 

| 
---|--- 

(c)

|

the assignor and the Purchaser or Vendor (as applicable) must procure that, if
an assignee permitted pursuant to Clause 22.2(a) ceases or proposes to cease
to be a member of the Purchaser Group or Vendor Group (as applicable), the
assignee will immediately transfer all of the interest assigned to it to
another member of the Purchaser Group or Vendor Group (as applicable); and 

| 
---|--- 

(d)

|

the assignor will remain liable for any obligations under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

23.

|

PAYMENTS, SET-OFF AND DEFAULT INTEREST 

| 
---|--- 

23.1

|

Any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement by the Purchaser to the
Vendor shall be made to the Vendor's Bank Account and any payment to be made
pursuant to this Agreement by the Vendor to the Purchaser shall be made to the
Purchaser's Bank Account, in each case by way of electronic transfer in
immediately available funds on or before the due date for payment. Receipt of
such sum in such account on or before the due date for payment shall be a good
discharge by the payor of its obligation to make such payment. 

| 
---|--- 

23.2

|

Where any payment is made in satisfaction of a liability arising under this
Agreement (other than pursuant to Clause 3) the amount of the payment shall
be, to the extent lawful, treated as an adjustment to the Final Consideration. 

| 
---|--- 

23.3

|

All payments made by any party to this Agreement under this Agreement, or any
of the other Transaction Documents, shall be made free from any set-off,
counterclaim or other deduction or withholding of any nature whatsoever,
except for deductions or withholdings required to be made by Law. If any
deductions or withholdings are required by Law to be made from any such
payments (excluding payments of interest or the payment of the Initial
Consideration or any payment due under Clauses 3.4, 3.5, 7.7, 7.9 or 11 or
under the Escrow Agreement), the amount of the payment shall be increased by
such amount as will, after the deduction or withholding has been made, leave
the recipient of the payment with the same amount as it would have been
entitled to receive in the absence of any such requirement to make a deduction
or withholding. 

| 
---|--- 

23.4

|

To the extent that any party becomes aware of any requirement to deduct or
withhold any amount of or in respect of Tax from the payment of the Initial
Consideration or any payment due under Clauses 3.4, 3.5 or 11, such party
shall notify the other party as soon as reasonably practicable. If any
deduction or withholding is required by Law, the parties shall cooperate in
good faith and shall use reasonable endeavours to mitigate or counteract any
such deduction or withholding. 

| 
---|--- 

23.5

|

Where the Vendor or the Purchaser default in the payment when due of any
damages or other sum payable by virtue of this Agreement or any other
Transaction Documents the liability of the Vendor or the Purchaser (as the
case may be) shall be increased to include an amount equal to interest on such
sum from the date when payment is due to the date of actual payment (both
before and after judgment) at that annual rate which is 2% per annum above the
base lending 

 

42

rate of HSBC Bank plc from time to time in effect during such period. Such
interest shall accrue from day to day and be compounded quarterly and shall be
payable without prejudice to any other remedy available to the Vendor or the
Purchaser (as the case may be) in respect of such default.
