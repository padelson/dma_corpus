shall not create in any current or former employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries any rights to employment or continued employment with Purchaser,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any right
to any specific terms or conditions of employment.



(b) For at least one year following the Closing Date, any employee
benefit plan of Purchaser or its Affiliates providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits in which employees of the Company as of
the Closing Date are eligible to participate following the Closing Date shall,
except to the extent prohibited by the terms of such plan as in effect on the
date hereof or applicable Law, (i) waive pre-existing condition exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and other limitations or restrictions on
coverage for such employees and their covered dependents to the extent any
such exclusions or requirements were satisfied by the applicable employee or
dependent under a similar Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the

employees and dependents during the current plan year up to and including the
date such employees or dependents participation in the applicable plan of

applicable coinsurance, co-payment, deductible, maximum out-of-pocket
requirements and like adjustments or limitations, to the extent such expenses
were recognized for similar purposes under any similar Employee Benefit Plan.



(c) Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries who continues to be an employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, except to the extent prohibited by
the terms of such plan as in effect on the date hereof or applicable Law,
credit for such employees service with the Company for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (except for



 

31 benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) under the employee
benefit plans and employee compensation policies and practices of Purchaser
or its Affiliates in which such employees participate to the extent prior
service would be credited for similarly situated employees of Purchaser had
they been hired on the date hereof.



§6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly notify each other of (i) any material actions, suits,
claims or proceedings in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement commenced or, to the knowledge of Purchaser or the Knowledge of
Sellers, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, or (ii) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any fact or event
which would be reasonably likely to cause any condition set forth in Article
VII not to be satisfied; _provided_ , that no such notification, nor the
obligation to make such notification, shall affect the representations,
warranties or covenants of any party or the conditions to the obligations of
any party to this Agreement.



§6.7  _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, sales and use, value-added,
registration, documentary, stamp and similar Taxes imposed in connection with
the sale of the Shares or any other transaction that occurs pursuant to this
Agreement shall be borne solely by Purchaser.



§6.8 _Antitrust Laws_. (a) Each party hereto shall take promptly all actions
necessary to make the filings required of it or any of its Affiliates under
any applicable Antitrust Laws in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including filing the Notification and
Report Form required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission no later than the fifth (5th)
Business Day following the date hereof.



(b) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of all filing fees under
the Act against Restraints of Competition, Council Regulation (EEC) No.
4064189, the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws.



(c) Each party hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which
shall include litigation) to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
any Antitrust Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
context of this _Section 6.8_ , "commercially reasonable efforts" shall
include:



(i) if Purchaser or Sellers receive a formal request for additional
information or documentary material from an Antitrust Authority, Purchaser and
Sellers shall substantially comply with such formal request as soon as
reasonably practicable and in any event within sixty (60) days following the
date of its receipt thereof;



 

32 (ii) subject to Purchasers compliance with clause (i) above, Sellers shall
not frustrate or impede Purchasers strategy or negotiating positions with
any Antitrust Authority and promptly upon any filing, Purchaser or Sellers, as
the case may be, shall provide the other party a complete copy of any filing
with any Antitrust Authority (subject to redaction of financial information
in non-overlapping codes and other material not reasonably needed by the other
party or disclosure of which is prohibited by Antitrust Laws) and each of
Purchaser and Sellers shall promptly respond to any request from the other
for information or documentation reasonably requested by the other party in
connection with the development and implementation of a strategy and
negotiating positions with any Antitrust Authorities; provided that access to
any such filing, information or documentation will, at such partys request
be restricted to such other parties, outside counsel and economists or
advisers retained by such counsel;



(iii) Purchaser at its sole cost, shall timely comply with all restrictions
and conditions, if any, specified or imposed by any Antitrust Authority with
respect to Antitrust Laws as a requirement for granting any necessary
clearance or terminating any applicable waiting period, including agreeing to
hold separate, divest, license or cause a third party to purchase, assets
and/or businesses of Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, it
being understood that Purchaser shall be permitted to negotiate in good faith
with the Antitrust Authorities;



(iv) in the event any Antitrust Authority initiates a proceeding before
any Governmental or Regulatory Authority seeking to restrain, enjoin or
prohibit the sale of the Shares, Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
prevent the entry of any order restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the sale
of the Shares, including by retaining all appropriate expert witnesses and
consultants. Sellers shall be permitted to participate in all aspects of the
defense of such proceedings and Purchaser shall use its best efforts to
prevail in the litigation. Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of
its own expenses, including legal fees and expenses, in seeking to prevent the
entry of any such order; and



(v) Purchaser shall not agree with any Antitrust Authority to delay the
Closing, and shall not agree to provide advance notice of the Closing, to
any Antitrust Authority, in each case, without the consent of Sellers.



(d) Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other parties of any material
communication made to, or received by such party from, any Antitrust Authority
or any other Governmental or Regulatory Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that no party
shall be required to take any action waiving the attorney-client privilege.



(e) Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of Sellers and the
Companys expenses in connection with obtaining the approval of any Antitrust
Authority, including legal fees and expenses, in substantially complying with
any formal request for additional information or documentary material from any
Antitrust Authority and in connection with any litigation.

7.3 and 9.7 of this Agreement, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or shall otherwise exist against Sellers Representative.

grants to Sellers Representative, the right, power and authority to (x) take
all actions on behalf of Sellers as provided in Sections 2.3(a), 2.3(b), 7.1,

protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any Seller, or
Purchaser, or any other evidence deemed by the Sellers Representative to be
reliable, and the Sellers Representative shall be entitled to act on the
advice of counsel selected by it. As against any other Seller, Sellers
Representative shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any
action under this Agreement unless it shall have received such advice or
concurrence of such Sellers as it deems appropriate or it shall have been
expressly indemnified to its satisfaction by the Sellers appointing it,
severally according to their respective Applicable Percentages, against any
and all liability and expense that the Sellers Representative may incur by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.



(d) Sellers Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and to incur
such expenses as Sellers Representative deems to be necessary or appropriate
in connection with its performance of its obligations under this Agreement,

34 Representative shall be borne by the Sellers ratably in accordance with their
respective Applicable Percentages and shall be paid, first, from the Purchase
Price Escrow Amount (to the extent available after satisfaction of all
obligations of the Sellers pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_ ) and second, if
necessary, by Sellers ratably in accordance with each Sellers Applicable
Percentage.



(e) Each Seller hereby agrees to severally indemnify Sellers Representative
(in its capacity as such) ratably according to its Applicable Percentage

at any time be imposed upon, incurred by or asserted against Sellers
Representative in such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of its
action or failures to take action pursuant to this Agreement, or
in connection herewith in such capacity.



§6.10 _Tax Elections_. Purchaser shall be permitted to make or cause to be
made an election under Section 338(g) of the Code and Sellers to cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to execute (immediately prior to the Closing and
conditional on the Closing occurring) an IRS Form 8832 provided to the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries by the Purchaser with respect to any change in
the entity classification of Tetra Management GmbH from a corporation to
"disregarded as an entity separate from its owner" pursuant to Treas. Reg.
Section 301.7701-3 of the Code with an effective date prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Sellers shall have any
liabilities to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold each
Seller harmless for any Taxes, losses or expenses resulting from either such
tax election.



§6.11 _No Solicitations_. Sellers shall not, and shall not permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of the directors, officers, employees,
advisors, representatives or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Representatives_ "), to, directly or indirectly, (i)
discuss or enter into any transaction involving a merger, consolidation,
business combination, purchase or disposition of any amount of the assets of
the Company (other than the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of
business) or any of its Subsidiaries or any capital stock of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries other than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (an " _Acquisition Transaction_ "), or (ii) otherwise cooperate in
any way with, or assist or encourage, any effort or attempt by any other
person with respect to an Acquisition Transaction. Sellers agree not to (and
to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to) release any third party from
the confidentiality provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party.



§6.12 _Nondisclosure_. Each of the Sellers hereby covenants and agrees that
each Seller and its Affiliates under its control shall not (A) as to Trade
Secrets, as long as they remain Trade Secrets, and (B) as to Confidential
Information, during the two-year period following the Closing Date, use or
disclose any Trade Secrets or Confidential Information, except for disclosures
to authorized representatives of the Company or Purchaser; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply



 

35 to information that has entered the public domain other than by an
unauthorized disclosure by any Seller or its Affiliates which it controls,
any information required to be disclosed by a Governmental or Regulatory
Authority or under applicable Laws, any information independently developed
without reliance on any Trade Secrets or Confidential Information
or Confidential Information received subsequently from third parties and not
subject to confidentiality restrictions. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "
_Trade Secret_ " means any information which constitutes a trade secret under
applicable Law; and (B) " _Confidential Information_ " is any data or
information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than Trade
Secrets, whether currently existing or hereafter developed or acquired, which
is competitively sensitive and not generally known to the public. For
avoidance of doubt, there shall be no restriction on any Seller or their
Affiliates to use or disclose the residual knowledge that has resulted from
access to or work with the Trade Secrets or Confidential Information. The
term " _residual knowledge_ " as used herein means the general ideas,
concepts, know-how or techniques used by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and retained in the unaided mental impressions of Sellers or
their Affiliates personnel who have had authorized access to such ideas,
concepts, know-how and techniques. For the purposes of this Section, a
recipients mental impressions (or memory) are only "unaided" if that
recipient did not make any intentional effort to memorize the information for
the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing such information
for commercial or non-commercial exploitation.



§6.13 _Foreign Subsidiaries_. Immediately prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Sellers shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to sell certain Subsidiaries of the Company to be mutually and
reasonably agreed by the Sellers Representative and Purchaser (such
entities collectively, the " _Foreign Subsidiaries_ ") to Purchaser or its
Affiliate and Purchaser shall, or shall cause its designated Affiliates to,
purchase the Foreign Subsidiaries, all pursuant to the Share Purchase
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ for aggregate
consideration to be mutually and reasonably agreed between the Sellers
Representative and Purchaser (the " _Foreign Subsidiary Amount_ "), which the
parties hereto acknowledge is being paid as a result of the inclusion of the
Foreign Subsidiary Amount in the definition of Cash. None of the Sellers shall
have any liability to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and
hold each Seller harmless, for any Taxes, losses or expenses resulting from
the sale of the Foreign Subsidiaries (including with respect to the allocation
of value to the Foreign Subsidiaries). The Foreign Subsidiaries shall be
treated as Subsidiaries of the Company on the Closing Date for purposes of
_Section 2.2_ , _Section 2.3_ , the representations and warranties, the
covenants, the conditions, and all other purposes under this Agreement.



§6.14 _Officers and Directors_. If requested by Purchaser, Sellers shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain resignation letters, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, from such officers and/or directors of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as is specified by Purchaser;
_provided_ , that in no event shall Sellers be required to (a) initiate
litigation against any such officer or director, (b) in any manner



 

36 terminate the employment relationship of any such Person with the Company or
any such Subsidiary or (c) otherwise take any action which would reasonably
be expected to result in any liability of any Seller in connection with
obtaining the requested resignation letters, and Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold each Seller harmless for any losses or expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining such resignation letters.

WHEREAS, the parties hereto have agreed upon and wish to set forth herein the
terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to the Escrow Fund
(as defined below) to be held by the Escrow Agent.

"). The Escrow Fund held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall
constitute trust property for the purposes for which it is held.



4\. _Liabilities Secured by Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Fund shall, subject to

provisions but also as to the truth and acceptability of any information
therein contained, which it in good faith believes to be genuine and what it
purports to be.



 

-2- (c) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or for any
act done or step taken or omitted by it, or for any mistake of fact or law or
for anything which it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith,
except for fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct or for any action taken

Indemnitees or any of them for following any instruction or direction upon
which the Escrow Agent is authorized to rely pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. In addition to and not in limitation of the immediately
preceding sentence, Sellers Representative and Purchaser, jointly and
severally, also covenant and agree to indemnify and hold the Indemnitees and
each of them harmless from and against any Damages that may be imposed on,
incurred by, or asserted against the Indemnitees or any of them in connection
with or arising out of the Escrow Agents performance under this Agreement;
_provided_ the Escrow Agent has not acted with fraud, gross negligence or bad
faith or engaged in willful misconduct. The provisions of this Section 7(c)
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal
of the Escrow Agent for any reason. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of
such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. 



(d) In the administration of this Agreement and the Escrow Fund hereunder,
the Escrow Agent may consult with counsel or accountants to be selected and
retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for anything done,
suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or
opinion of any such counsel or accountant.



(e) The Escrow Agent shall have no duties except those which are expressly set
forth herein, and it shall not be bound by any notice of a claim, or demand
with respect thereto, or any waiver, modification, amendment, termination
or rescission of this Agreement, unless in writing received by it.



(f) The Escrow Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof
to each of Sellers Representative and Purchaser, but such resignation shall
not become effective until a successor Escrow Agent mutually agreed to by
Sellers Representative and Purchaser shall have been appointed and shall have
accepted such appointment in



 

-3- writing. In the event that an instrument of acceptance by a successor Escrow
Agent shall not have been delivered to the Escrow Agent within thirty (30)
days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Escrow
Agent may, at the joint and several expense of Sellers Representative and
Purchaser, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to withhold
an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount due and owing to the Escrow
Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe
may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the appointment of a
successor Escrow Agent. Any corporation or association into which the Escrow
Agent in its individual capacity may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent in its
individual capacity shall be a party, or any corporation or association to
which all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Escrow
Agent in its individual capacity may be sold or otherwise transferred, shall
be the Escrow Agent under this Agreement without further act.



(g) The Escrow Agents sole duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and
physical preservation of the Escrow Fund shall be to deal such Escrow Fund in
the same manner as the Escrow deals with similar property for its own account.



8\. _Investment of Escrow Fund_. (a) The Escrow Fund shall be invested and
reinvested by the Escrow Agent in any one or more Permitted Investments
(as defined below) from time to time as maturities occur and as directed in
writing by Seller.



" _Permitted Investments_ " shall mean each of (i) U.S. dollar denominated,
direct, noncallable, full-faith-and-credit obligations of the federal
government of the United States of America, (ii) certificates of deposit,
bankers acceptances or time deposits having maturities of six months or less
from the date of acquisition and issued by a United States commercial bank
which has unsecured senior debt securities or letters of credit rated at
least P-1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or A-1 by Standard and Poors
Corporation, (iii) commercial paper or securities with maturities of 90 days
or less from the date of acquisition rated at least P-1 by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. and A-1 by Standard and Poors Corporation (or, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii) above, if neither of such rating agencies is then
providing ratings, the equivalent thereof by another investor service
of comparable national recognition selected by Sellers Representative and
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) and (iv) a money market mutual fund which
invests primarily in the Permitted Investments set forth in (i), (ii) or
(iii).



(b) The Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Fund in The Wilmington
U.S. Government Portfolio/Service class shares in the absence of written
instructions of Sellers Representative as to the investment of the Escrow
Fund.



(c) Neither Seller nor the Escrow Agent shall have liability for any loss
incurred as a result of investments made in accordance with the provisions
of this Section.



9\. _Investment Income_. (a) All investment income shall be retained and

-4- (b) The Escrow Agent may liquidate any investments made hereunder at such time
as it shall deem necessary to make payments in accordance with the provisions
hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss incurred as a
result of liquidation made by it in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 9(c).



10\. _Amendment and Termination_. This Agreement may be amended or terminated
by and upon written notice to the Escrow Agent at any time given jointly by
Purchaser and Sellers Representative, but the duties or responsibilities of
