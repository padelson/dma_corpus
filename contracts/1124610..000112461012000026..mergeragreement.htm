SECTION 3

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS

3.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any
Company Securityholder:

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become, and shall represent, one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and
shall constitute the only outstanding share of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with immediately preceding sentence.

(b) Conversion of Securities.

(i) Except as otherwise provided herein and in Section 3.1(c) each share of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration
payable to the holder thereof, without interest, upon the surrender of the
certificate representing such share in accordance with the terms hereof and in
the manner provided herein, less the applicable portion of the Escrow Amount
(as set forth in the Securityholder Schedule).

(ii) From and after the Effective Time, each such share of Company Common
Stock converted pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) shall no longer be outstanding
and shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Consideration to be
paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificates in
accordance with Section 3.5, without interest, or, if such share of Company
Common Stock is a Dissenting Share, the right, if any, to receive payment as
determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL or, if
applicable, Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code.

(c) Cancellation. Each share of Company Stock owned by the Company as treasury
stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to exist and
be canceled without any conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution of
any consideration shall be made with respect thereto.

3.2 Dissenting Holders.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
eligible under the DGCL to exercise appraisal or dissenters' rights and held
by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Agreement and the Merger or
consented thereto in writing and who has exercised and perfected appraisal or
dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
or, if Section 2115 of the California Corporations Code applies to the
Company, Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code, and has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or dissenters' rights
(collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the consideration for Company Stock set forth
in Section 3.1(b)(i), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be
entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in
Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California
Corporations Code. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.2(a), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder's appraisal and dissenters' rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California
Corporations Code, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such shares in accordance with Section 3.5, the
consideration for such shares set forth in Section 3.1(b)(i), without
interest, less the applicable portion of the Escrow Amount with respect to
such shares (as set forth in the Securityholder Schedule).

(c) The Company shall (i) comply with the requirements of Section 262 of the
DGCL and, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the California Corporations Code, (ii)
give Parent prompt notice of any written demand received by the Company
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or, if applicable, Chapter 13 of the
California Corporations Code, and of withdrawals of such demands, and provide
copies of any documents or instruments served pursuant to the DGCL or, if
applicable, the California Corporations Code and received by the Company and
(iii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer with respect to any
such demand unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or
settlement offer.

(d) Any amount paid by Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation to any
Person with respect to Dissenting Shares in excess of the amount that would
otherwise be payable pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) for each such Dissenting
Share (such amount, unless determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a
court, being subject to the written approval of the Stockholder
Representative, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), and all interest, costs, expenses and fees incurred by the
Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with the exercise
of all rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and, if applicable, Chapter 13 of
the California Corporations Code, shall constitute "Damages" for purposes of
this Agreement, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
shall, without limiting any other rights, be entitled to indemnification for
such Damages as set forth in SECTION 15 hereof.

3.3 Company Options and Restricted Stock.

(a) Vested Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate action so that each Vested Option shall, immediately
following the Effective Time, be terminated and converted into the right to
receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a cash amount
equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Option and (B) the excess of the Per Share
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Vested Option (the "Vested Option Payment") which amount shall
be subject to applicable tax withholding. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that any payment in cancellation of the Vested Options is for the
benefit of Parent. To the extent that any payment in cancellation of the
Vested Options is paid on, or allocable to, the Closing Date, such payment
shall be treated by the parties hereto for United States federal income tax
purposes, and any similar provisions under state, local or foreign Legal Requirements, as occurring at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date in accordance with the "next day rule" of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B).

(b) Unvested Option Conversion.

(i) Each Unvested Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be assumed by Parent at the Effective Time and substituted with an option
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Unvested Option as granted or issued by the Company (except as provided
below), the number of shares of Class A Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock"), rounded down to the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Unvested Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time by a fraction rounded to five (5)
decimal places (the "Option Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which shall
equal the Per Share Consideration and the denominator of which shall be the
average of the closing prices of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange as reported on www.marketwatch.com for the ten (10) trading days
ending on (and inclusive of) the trading day that is two (2) full trading days
prior to (and not inclusive of) the Closing Date (the "Parent Stock Price"),
at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock equal to the per share
exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable
pursuant to such Unvested Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded
up to the nearest whole cent.

(ii) In the case of any Unvested Option that is intended to qualify as an
incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, as a condition to the
substitution by Parent of such Unvested Option, the holder shall be required
to, prior to the Effective Time, enter into an agreement in a form acceptable
to Parent (an "Assumed Option Agreement") providing that such Unvested Option
will no longer be an incentive stock option after the Effective Time and
providing, that in the case of any Unvested Option that includes in its terms
an early exercise feature, the Assumed Option Agreement will provide that the
holder waives the early exercise provision of such Unvested Option.

(iii) Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary or appropriate to
have available for issuance or transfer a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon the exercise of the Unvested Options
substituted with options to purchase Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
3.3(b)(i) (following the vesting of such converted Unvested Options in
accordance with their terms). Parent will cause the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock necessary to fulfill Parent's obligations under this Section
3.3(b)(iii) to be registered on a registration statement on Form S-8, to the
extent such form is available, (or any successor form) with the Securities and
Exchange Commission at Closing.

(c) Section 409A. Parent shall effectuate such assumption and substitution in
a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code, as
applicable, and Section 409A of the Code. (d) Other Options. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
necessary and appropriate action so that each Out-of-the-Money Option shall,
at the Effective Time, be terminated without consideration and shall be of no
further force and effect.

(e) Required Notices and Consents. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
will take all action necessary or appropriate to effect the treatment of
Company Options provided for under this Section 3.3 under the Company Option
Plans, all Contracts governing the terms of all Company Options and under any
other plan or arrangement to which the Company is a party or by which the
Company may be bound, including giving any required notice and obtaining any
required consent contemplated thereby. The Company shall, at the request of
Parent, send to any holders of Company Options notices drafted by Parent with
respect to the treatment of such instruments under this Agreement. The Company
will not send any notices to any holders of Company Options or solicit any
consents or other approvals from the holders of any Company Options unless and
until Parent has reviewed all notices and related documentation (including any
email messages and notifications) to be sent to such holders.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary and
appropriate actions so that each compensatory grant of shares of Company
Common Stock that is, immediately prior to the Effective Time, outstanding and
subject to forfeiture conditions or repurchase restrictions (including such
awards resulting from the early exercise of a Company Option, each, a "Company
Restricted Stock Award") shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be
forfeited to the Company in exchange for a restricted stock grant (a "Parent
Restricted Stock Award") of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole share) with a fair market value (measured based on
the Parent Stock Price) equal to the product of (1) the Per Share
Consideration and (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
the Company Restricted Stock Award, which Parent Restricted Stock Award shall
vest in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Company Restricted
Stock Award to which it relates pertaining to lapse of forfeiture conditions
or repurchase rights. Parent shall issue the Parent Restricted Stock Awards
required by this Section 3.3(f) promptly following the Effective Time.

(g) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall not make additional
grants of Company Options or any other equity or equity-based awards, except
as contemplated by this Section 3.3(g). The Company shall be permitted to
grant restricted stock units with respect to Company Common Stock ("Company
Restricted Stock Units") to those individuals to whom the Company anticipated
making grants of Company Options but to whom Company Options have not been
granted as of the date hereof as set forth on Section 3.3(g) of the Disclosure
Schedule. Each such grant of Company Restricted Stock Units shall be
conditioned on an acknowledgment by the recipient that the grant is in full
satisfaction of any obligation the Company may have had to make grants of or
with respect to Company Common Stock and shall provide for time-based vesting
with respect to 25% of the total number of shares subject to the award on the
first day of the first calendar month coincident with or next following the
first anniversary of the date of employment and 12.5% of the total number of
shares subject to the award on the first day of the first calendar month
coincident with or next following each subsequent six month anniversary of the
first anniversary of the date of employment, provided that the individual has
continued his or her employment with the Company or an Affiliate. Section 3.3(g) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each individual for whom
a grant of Company Options was anticipated and the number of Company Options
previously anticipated to be granted to such individual. At the Effective
Time, each grant of Company Restricted Stock Units that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a restricted
stock unit grant (a "Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award") with respect to a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) with a fair market value (measured based on the Parent Stock Price)
equal to the product of (1) the Per Share Consideration and (2) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Restricted Stock Unit
award, which Parent Restricted Stock Unit Award shall vest in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the Company Restricted Stock Unit award to which
it relates. Parent shall issue the Parent Restricted Stock Unit Awards
required by this Section 3.3(g) promptly following the Effective Time.

3.4 Escrow. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent, on behalf of the
Indemnifying Holders, shall deliver or cause to be delivered cash in an amount
equal to the Escrow Amount to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to the provisions of the escrow
agreement in the form attached as Exhibit D hereto, subject to any amendments
to such form requested by the Escrow Agent and mutually agreed to by Parent
and the Stockholder Representative (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow
Agreement shall be entered into at the Effective Time, by and among Parent,
the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders and the
Escrow Agent, and shall provide Parent with recourse against amounts held in
escrow by the Escrow Agent with respect to the Indemnifying Holders'
indemnification obligations under SECTION 15, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement and in such SECTION 15 of this
Agreement (the "Escrow Fund"). The Escrow Amount (or any portion thereof)
shall be distributed to the Indemnifying Holders, and Parent at the times, and
upon the terms and conditions, set forth in the Escrow Agreement. The terms
and provisions of the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated
thereby are specific terms of the Merger, and the approval and adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Indemnifying Holders pursuant
to the Stockholder Written Consent shall constitute approval by such
Indemnifying Holders, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable
agreement of such Indemnifying Holders to be bound by and comply with, the
Escrow Agreement and all of the arrangements and provisions of this Agreement
relating thereto, including, the deposit of the Escrow Amount into escrow, the
indemnification obligations set forth in SECTION 15 hereof and the appointment
and sole authority to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders of the
Stockholder Representative, as provided for herein and in the Escrow
Agreement. For Tax purposes, the Escrow Amount shall be treated as being owned
by Parent and Parent will comply with all reporting requirements associated
therewith.

3.5 Surrender of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent.

(i) On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Paying Agent")
for the benefit of the Company Stockholders, cash in an amount equal to the
Total Equity Consideration minus the Escrow Amount minus the aggregate amount
of the Vested Option Payment. Such funds shall be invested as directed by Parent pending
payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the Company Stockholders. Earnings from
such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of the Company Stockholders.

(ii) Prior to the Effective Time and in accordance with the requirements of
the Paying Agent, the Company shall deliver to the Paying Agent and Parent a
schedule in such form as required by the Paying Agent containing such
information as is necessary for the Paying Agent to make the Stock Closing
Payments to the Company Stockholders.

(b) Surrender Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but no later than two (2) Business Days thereafter, Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each Company Stockholder as of the
Effective Time (i) a Company Stockholder Letter of Transmittal and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of certificate(s) representing
all of the shares of Company Stock held by such Company Stockholder in
exchange for the applicable Stock Closing Payment. The payment of the Stock
Closing Payment with respect to each share of Company Stock underlying each
such certificate is conditioned upon (A) the execution and delivery of such
transmittal letter and (B) the delivery of such certificates related thereto.
As soon as practicable after receipt by the Paying Agent of such
certificate(s), properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and
cancellation, together with such duly completed and validly executed Company
Stockholder Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent shall, in exchange
therefor, pay to such Company Stockholder the Stock Closing Payment payable in
respect of the shares of Company Stock formerly represented by the
certificate(s) surrendered, but without interest and less any applicable
withholding taxes, and the certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. If payment of any portion of the applicable Stock Closing Payment is
to be made to a person, firm, entity, partnership, association or any business
organization or division thereof (each a "Person") other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered certificate(s) are registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment (x) shall have
paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of those
amounts to a Person other than the registered holder of the certificate(s)
surrendered, and shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax has been paid, or (y) shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax is not applicable.
From and after the Effective Time, until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.5(b), each certificate formerly representing shares of Company Stock
shall be deemed to represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
applicable consideration as provided pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) hereof, if
any, in respect of such shares of Company Stock formerly represented thereby
in accordance with the terms hereof and in the manner provided herein or
Dissenting Shares as provided in Section 3.2.

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the shares
of Company Stock on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of certificates formerly evidencing ownership of the shares
of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as
otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Legal Requirements. After the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall cancel and exchange, as provided in
this SECTION 3, any presented certificate representing shares of Company Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Termination of Fund; No Liability. At any time following the first
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any earnings received with respect thereto) that had been made available to
the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to Company Stockholders and
thereafter such Company Stockholders shall be entitled to look only to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar Legal Requirements) and only as general creditors thereof with respect
to the applicable portion of the Stock Closing Payment, upon due surrender of
their certificates formerly representing shares of Company Stock, without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a certificate
formerly representing shares of Company Stock for any amounts delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Legal Requirement.

(e) Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payment of
the Stock Closing Payment or any other amounts (or any portion thereof)
payable pursuant to this Agreement to, or on behalf of, any Company
Securityholder, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from payment of any amounts (or any portion thereof) otherwise payable
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement to any Company Securityholder, such amounts
as they may reasonably believe are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts shall
be paid by such withholding party to the relevant taxing authority and shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Company Securityholder to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any certificate(s)
which formerly represented shares of Company Stock shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact
by the Company Stockholder thereof in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such Company Stockholder the
applicable Stock Closing Payment as provided in this SECTION 3; provided,
however, that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its sole discretion and as a
condition precedent to issuing such instruction to the Paying Agent, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate(s) to deliver an
agreement of indemnification in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent with respect to the certificate(s) alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

(g) Dissenting Shares. The provisions of this Section 3.5 shall also apply to
Dissenting Shares that lose their status as such, except that the obligations
of Parent under this Section 3.5 shall commence on the date of loss of such
status and the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for such shares the applicable
amounts provided in SECTION 3.

3.6 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Parent
determines any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time are and will remain fully authorized in the name of the Company and
Merger Sub or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such action.

(a) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement by the Company, the
Company shall duly take all lawful action to obtain the Requisite Stockholder
Approval. Immediately following the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company shall deliver evidence of such approval to Parent.

(b) As expeditiously as possible following the date hereof, the Company shall
(i) complete the preparation of an information statement accurately describing
this Agreement, the Merger and the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the
"Information Statement"), (ii) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Information Statement and (iii) thereafter deliver
the Information Statement to those Company Stockholders that did not execute
the Stockholder Written Consent for the purpose of informing them of the
approval of the Merger, the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL and their rights under Section 262 of the DGCL and
seeking their consent. The information furnished in any document mailed,
delivered or otherwise furnished to the Company Stockholders in connection
with the solicitation or their consent to, and adoption of, this Agreement and
the approval of the principal terms of the Merger, including the statements in
the Information Statement, will not contain, at or prior to the Effective
Time, any untrue statement of a material fact and will not omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall notify the holders of
Company Stock and Company Options of the Transaction contemplated hereby, to
the extent required by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company
Organizational Documents, the Company Plans, any Legal Requirement (including
the DGCL) or other agreements or instruments governing such securities and as
contemplated herein.

7.2 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

(a) Confidentiality. The Company and the Stockholder Representative and each
Company Securityholder that has executed and delivered the Stockholder Written
Consent or a Company Stockholder Letter of Transmittal (collectively, the
"Consenting Securityholders"), and its legal, financial, accounting and other
representatives, will (a) treat and hold any Confidential Information as
confidential, and (b) refrain from disclosing any Confidential Information to
any third party (other than their legal, financial, accounting or other
representatives that have a need to know), provided, however that a Company
Stockholder that is a venture capital fund may make disclosures to its
partners or members, subject to a duty of confidentiality, so long as such
disclosure is limited to the results of such stockholder's or member's
investment in the Company and such other information as is required to be
disclosed to such stockholder or member pursuant to its partnership agreement,
limited liability company agreement or comparable organizational agreement. In
the event that the Company is requested or required pursuant to oral or written question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Company will notify Parent promptly of the request or
requirement so that Parent may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.2(a). If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Company is legally
required to disclose any Confidential Information, the Company may disclose
the Confidential Information to the extent so required (but only to the extent
so required); provided, however, that the Company shall permit, to the maximum
extent possible, Parent to seek, prior to any such disclosure, an order or
other assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the
Confidential Information required to be disclosed. The Company will cooperate
with Parent in seeking such treatment. The provisions of this Section 7.2(a)
shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company may include reference to the existence of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein (but without disclosure of
the terms of the transactions contemplated hereunder including the amount of
the Total Equity Consideration and the Per Share Consideration) in any request
for any third party consent necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated under this Agreement, provided that the text of such reference
shall be approved in advance by Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement or in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, following
Closing, the Stockholder Representative shall be permitted to: (i) following
the public announcement of the Merger, publicly announce that it has been
engaged to serve as the Stockholder Representative in connection with the
Merger as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other terms
of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated herein; and (ii) disclose
information as required by any applicable Legal Requirement or to employees,
advisors or consultants of the Stockholder Representative and to the
Indemnifying Holders, in each case who have a need to know such information,
provided that such persons either (x) agree to observe the terms of this
Section 7.2(a) or (y) are bound by obligations of confidentiality to the
Stockholder Representative of at least as high a standard as those imposed on
the Stockholder Representative under this Section 7.2(a).

Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours to its
premises, properties, books, records, financial, tax and accounting records
(including, the work papers of the Company's independent accountants),
Contracts, personnel, counsel, financial advisors and auditors during the Pre-
Closing Period to obtain all information concerning its business, including
the status of product development efforts, properties, results of operations
and personnel for purposes of this Agreement, as Parent may reasonably
request; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access
to the extent that in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) any applicable Legal Requirement requires the Company to
restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information. In
addition, any information obtained from the Company or by Parent pursuant to
the access contemplated by this Section 7.2(b) shall constitute "Confidential
Information" under the Confidentiality Agreement.

7.3 Public Disclosure. No press release or any public disclosure, either
written or oral, of the transactions contemplated hereby or negotiations
related thereto shall be made by the Company, any Company Securityholder, the
Stockholder Representative or any of the Company's Representatives, without
the express prior written consent of Parent. Parent will consult with the Company prior to issuing any press release or making any
public disclosure related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

7.4 Stockholder Representative. Unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements, the Stockholder Representative agrees that it (and its legal,
financial, accounting and other representatives) shall hold in confidence all
non-public information acquired in accordance with Section 7.2(a) of this
Agreement.

7.5 Regulatory Filings; Exchange of Information; Notification; Reasonable Best
Efforts.

(a) Regulatory Filings. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use all reasonable
best efforts to comply with, and shall each refrain from taking any action
that would impede compliance with, all applicable Legal Requirements, and as

Sub and the Company shall obtain or make all Consents with any Governmental

7.5(a) to comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements.

(b) Exchange of Information. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each shall
(and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to) promptly supply the

obtain any filings or other actions pursuant to Section 7.5(a). Except where
prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and any joint defense agreement entered into between
the parties or their counsel, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
(and shall cause each of their respective Affiliates to) (i) consult with the
others prior to taking a position with respect to any such filing or other
actions, (ii) to the extent reasonably required to permit appropriate
coordination of efforts, permit the others to review and discuss in advance,
and consider in good faith the views of the others in connection with, any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the
foregoing to any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) coordinate with the others in
preparing and exchanging such information, (iv) promptly provide the others
(and their counsel) with copies of all filings, presentations or submissions
(and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party with any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and (v) promptly provide the others (and their counsel)
with advance notice of, and an opportunity to attend (to the extent permitted
by the applicable Governmental Authority), any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, Parent shall have the principal responsibility
for devising and implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary
antitrust or competition clearances and shall take the lead in all meetings
and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection with
obtaining any necessary antitrust or competition clearances, subject to
Parent's obligations to exchange of information with the Company pursuant to
this Section 7.5(b) and Section 7.5(c).

(c) Notification. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will notify the
others promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any Governmental
Authority in connection with any filings or other actions made pursuant hereto
and (ii) any request by any Governmental Authority for amendments or
supplements to any filings or other actions made pursuant to, or for
information provided to comply in all material respects with any Legal
Requirements. Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any filing or other action made pursuant to Section
7.5(a), Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, will promptly
inform the others of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the
applicable Governmental Authority such amendment or supplement.

(d) Reasonable Best Efforts. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, each of the parties hereto agrees to use all reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using all reasonable best efforts to
(i) cause the conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 8, SECTION 9 and
SECTION 10 to be satisfied; (ii) avoid any Action by any Governmental
Authority; (iii) obtain all Consents or waivers from third parties, including
all applicable Consents under the Contracts (provided, that the parties will
discuss in good faith procedures to pursue third party Consents with respect
to the Merger, it being understood that the Company shall not make, or offer
to make, any payment or other commitment in connection with obtaining any such
Consent without the prior written Consent of Parent, which Consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld); (iv) defend any Actions challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby unless Parent
determines, in its reasonable discretion, after consultation with its counsel,
that litigation is not in its best interest; and (v) execute or deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection
with, and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company Board
shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, use all reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of any such Legal Requirement on the Merger,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to
take, or agree to take, any Action of Divestiture. 7.6 Advise of Changes. During the Pre-Closing Period, Parent and the Company
shall promptly advise the other party in writing to the extent it has
knowledge of (a) any event or circumstance that would reasonably be expected
to result in any representation or warranty made by it (and, in the case of
Parent, made by Merger Sub) in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, (b) any event or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to result in the failure by it (and, in the case of Parent, by Merger
Sub) to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
under this Agreement prior to the Effective Time, (c) any Material Adverse
Effect or (d) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
the Consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such
notification will be deemed to prevent or cure any breach of, or inaccuracy
in, amend or supplement any Section of the Disclosure Schedule, or otherwise
disclose an exception to, or affect in any manner, the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties or the
Indemnifying Holders under this Agreement.

7.7 Cooperation. Subject to compliance with applicable Legal Requirements,
from the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company shall confer
periodically with one or more representatives of Parent to report on
operational matters that are material and the general status of ongoing

Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall continue to
operate its business and make business decisions independently of Parent until
the Effective Time.

appropriate notices to the Company's employees and the taking of all actions
by the Company Board to effectuate the termination of the Company's 401(k)

provided that Company shall provide Parent for its review and comment advance
copies of communications with the Company's employees relating to such
termination.

respect to the reinstatement of such Potential 280G Benefits if such payments
or benefits could reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of any
excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code pursuant to documents
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit I; provided, that the Company
shall provide Parent for its review and comment advance copies of its
calculations and communications by which it intends to seek such waiver and
requisite approval.

Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, (a) terminate all
Contracts with any Related Parties (the "Related Party Agreements") (other than (i) those
Contracts set forth on Section 7.9 of the Disclosure Schedule, (ii) employment
related Contracts and (iii) Contracts the continuation of which Parent has
approved in writing) and (b) deliver releases executed by such Persons with
whom the Company or a Company Subsidiary has terminated such Contracts
pursuant to this Section 7.9 providing that such Related Party Agreement has
been terminated and is of no further force and effect and no further payments
are due, or may become due, and neither the Surviving Corporation or Parent

the terminating party or parties:

(a) by mutual written Consent of each of Parent and the Company;

consummated by January 21, 2013 (the "End Date"); provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 13.1(b) shall not be available to
any party whose action or failure to act has been a principal cause of the

failure is incapable of being cured; provided, however that at the request of
the other party the initial End Date may be extended thirty (30) days for the

purposes such extended date.

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if a Governmental Authority shall have
issued or enacted any Legal Requirement or taken any other action (including
the failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which
Legal Requirement is final and nonappealable, as applicable;

(d) by the Company, (i) upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, or
(ii) if any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub shall have
become untrue, in either case such that the conditions set forth in Section
10.1 would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time
such representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that if
such inaccuracy in Parent's or Merger Sub's representations and warranties or
breach by Parent or Merger Sub is curable prior to the End Date through the
exercise of reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 13.1(d) prior to thirty (30) days following the
receipt of written notice from the Company by Parent of such breach (it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 13.1(d) if the Company or a Company Subsidiary shall have materially
breached this Agreement or if such breach by Parent or Merger Sub is cured
such that such conditions would then be satisfied);

agreement set forth in this Agreement by the Company, or (ii) if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided that if such
inaccuracy in the Company's representations and warranties or breach by the
Company is curable by the Company prior to the End Date through the exercise
of reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 13.1(e) prior to the thirty (30) days following the receipt of written
notice from Parent by the Company of such breach (it being understood that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13.1(e) if
Parent shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the
Company or the Stockholder Representative is cured such that such conditions
would then be satisfied);

(f) by Parent, if the Stockholder Written Consents representing the Requisite
Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained immediately following the
execution of this Agreement or shall have been rescinded, revoked or changed
such that the Company no longer has the Requisite Stockholder Approval; or

(g) by Parent, if a Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred, or Parent
first becomes aware of a Material Adverse Effect, after the date hereof.

Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement under Section 13.1 above will be
effective immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice of the
terminating party to the other parties hereto.

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 13.1(b) and

promptly, but in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date of
termination, the amount set forth on Section 13.2(b) of the Disclosure
Schedule, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Company. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company shall receive payment
pursuant to this Section 13.2(b), the receipt of such amounts shall be deemed
to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by the Company or any of its Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination thereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the
basis for such termination, and none of the Company, its Affiliates or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, Action or proceeding against Parent or Merger Sub arising out of this Agreement (and the
termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination.

(c) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section
13.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect without Liability
(other than any payment required pursuant to Section 13.2(b)) on the part of
any party hereto; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary (i) the provisions set forth in Sections 7.2(a), 7.3, 7.4, this
Section 13.2, SECTION 14 and SECTION 19, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from Liability for any willful breach of this Agreement or willful failure to
fulfill any condition set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.
No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

SECTION 14

FEES AND EXPENSES; OPERATING COSTS

14.1 General. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) all fees,
costs and expenses of Parent or Merger Sub incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees and
expenses of financial advisors, financial sponsors, legal counsel and other
advisors, shall be paid by Parent or Merger Sub whether or not the Merger is
consummated and (b) all fees, costs and expenses of the Stockholder
Representative and all Company Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the
Company Securityholders whether or not the Merger is consummated, except that,
if the Merger is consummated, all amounts included in Estimated Transaction
Expenses shall be paid by Parent or its Subsidiaries.

14.2 Operating Costs. The parties hereto agree to comply with the obligations
set forth on Section 14.2 of the Disclosure Schedule.

SECTION 15

INDEMNIFICATION

15.1 Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties. Each Indemnifying Holder
shall be deemed to have agreed upon surrender of his, her or its
certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
shares of Company Stock, and hereby agrees, to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates (including, following
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries)
and their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders, agents,
representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified
Parties") from and against, and such Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to be compensated and reimbursed for, any and all Damages based upon,
arising from or related to any of the following (each a "Parent Claim"): (a) any misrepresentation or breach or failure of any representation or
warranty made by the Company or the Stockholder Representative in this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or in any certificate required to be delivered
by the Company pursuant to Sections 11.1(a), (l) and (p) under this Agreement
to be true, complete and correct in all respects as of the date hereof and as
of the Closing Date (in each case, as such representation or warranty would
read if all qualifications as to Knowledge and materiality, including each
reference to the defined term Material Adverse Effect, were deleted
therefrom);

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement made or to be
performed by the Company in this Agreement;

(c) any amount of Company Transaction Expenses, except to the extent that such
Company Transaction Expenses have been included in Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses;

(d) any amount of Change in Control Payments, except to the extent that such
Change in Control Payments have been included in the calculation of the
Estimated Change of Control Payments;

(e) any amount of Company Debt, except to the extent that such Company Debt
has been included in the calculation of the Estimated Company Debt;

(f) any amount by which the Estimated Company Cash Amount exceeds the Company
Cash Amount;

(g) any fraud in connection with this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
entered into by the Company in connection with this Agreement;

(h) any amounts that a Company Securityholder is entitled to receive in
connection with the Merger pursuant to the Company Organizational Documents,
any written or oral agreement with the Company or any other Legal Requirements
in excess of the amount indicated on the Securityholder Schedule (as updated
pursuant to Section 11.1(p)) as the amount such Company Securityholder is
entitled to receive in connection with the Merger;

(i) any inaccuracy in the Securityholder Schedule delivered to Parent pursuant
to Section 11.1(p).

15.2 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of the Company.

(a) During the period ending six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent
will ensure that the Company fulfills its obligations to the present and
former members of the Company Board and present and former officers of the
Company ("Covered Persons") pursuant to the terms of the Company's
Organizational Documents and any indemnification or other agreements as in
effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in the event the Company
does not have the resources to honor the foregoing obligations, Parent shall
honor such obligations. (b) No Indemnifying Holder (solely in their capacity as such) will have any
right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with any indemnification
obligation pursuant to the terms of the Company's Organizational Documents and
any indemnification or other agreements as in effect on the date hereof.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will purchase a prepaid
directors' and officers' liability insurance "run-off policy" with a claims
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date, and on terms and conditions no
less favorable to the Covered Persons than those in effect under the Company's
existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect on the
date hereof, for the benefit of the Covered Persons with respect to their acts
and omissions as directors, officers and employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries occurring prior to the Closing Date.

15.3 Remedy; Essential Terms.

(a) Other than with respect to Damages arising from or related to any
misrepresentation or breach or failure of any Fundamental Representation, with
respect to which the Basket shall not apply, the Indemnifying Holders will
have no obligation to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to
Section 15.1(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages incurred
or suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties subject to indemnification under
Section 15.1 exceeds $500,000 (the "Basket") (at which point the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the entire amount of such
Damages from the first dollar of loss as if such Basket did not exist). Except
for indemnification in respect of Parent Claims related to fraud, the
aggregate amount of indemnification available hereunder for any damages for
any matters relating to this Agreement and any certificate or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto shall be restricted to the amount of the Escrow Fund
and recovery from the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy at
law of the Parent Indemnified Parties. The Liability of the Indemnifying
Holders for indemnification hereunder shall be joint and several. In the case
of Parent Claims related to fraud, no Indemnifying Holder shall be
individually liable for more than the aggregate amount of the Per Share
Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying Holder (including all
amounts distributed to such Indemnifying Holder from the Escrow Fund, if any).

(b) Nothing in this Section 15.2 shall limit any remedy Parent may have
against any Person for fraud, except that any Liability of the Indemnifying
Holders for fraud shall be several and not joint and the aggregate Liability
of any Indemnifying Holder for any and all claims shall be the aggregate
amount of the Per Share Consideration actually received by such Indemnifying
Holder (including all amounts distributed to such Indemnifying Holder from the
Escrow Fund, if any).

(c) Notwithstanding the remedies available to the Parent Indemnified Parties
hereunder, the right of Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Parties to
pursue any action for any other remedies or relief under the Escrow Agreement,
the Non-competition Agreements, the Indemnifying Holder Joinder Agreements,
the DandO Release or the Offer Letters against the counterparties thereto will
not be limited hereby. (d) The terms and conditions of this SECTION 15 constitute essential terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Merger, and approval of this Agreement by
the Company Securityholders shall constitute the express agreement of each
Indemnifying Holder with respect to the obligations of Indemnifying Holders
pursuant to this SECTION 15.

15.4 Notification of Claims. During the Escrow Period, if a Parent Indemnified
Party is of the opinion that any Parent Claim has occurred or will occur, an
authorized officer or representative of such Parent Indemnified Party, as
applicable, shall notify the Stockholder Representative; provided that, no
delay in a Parent Indemnified Party to give notice to the Stockholder
Representative pursuant to this Section 15.4 will adversely affect any of the
other rights or remedies that any Parent Indemnified Party has under this
Agreement or alter or relieve the obligations of the Indemnifying Holders to
indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this SECTION 15, except
and to the extent that such delay has actually prejudiced such parties. Each
such notice shall be in writing and shall describe in reasonable detail, to
the extent known by the applicable Parent Indemnified Party, the basis for any
anticipated liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach
of warranty or breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related
(and the relevant section of this Agreement under which indemnification is
sought) and to the extent known by the applicable Parent Indemnified Party,
the amount of such Parent Claim.

15.5 Third Party Actions. In the event any Action is instituted by any third
party against a Parent Indemnified Party ("Third Party Action") which involves
or appears reasonably likely to involve a Parent Claim for which
indemnification may be sought, Parent will, promptly after receipt of notice
of any such Action, notify the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying
Holder, such Indemnifying Holder) of the commencement thereof. The failure to
so notify the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is
being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Holder, such Indemnifying
Holder) of the commencement of any such Action will not relieve the
Indemnifying Holders from Liability in connection therewith, except to the
extent that such failure materially and adversely affects the ability of the
Indemnifying Holders to defend their interests in such Action. Parent shall
have the right in its sole discretion to assume and control the defense or
settlement of such Action; provided that, the Stockholder Representative (or,
in the event indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from an
Indemnifying Holder, such Indemnifying Holder) and its counsel (at such
party's, or in the case of the Stockholder Representative, at the Indemnifying
Holder's, sole expense) may participate in (but not control the conduct of)
the defense of such Action, provided further that, except with the reasonable
Consent of the Stockholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is
being sought hereunder directly from an Indemnifying Holder, such Indemnifying
Holder), no settlement of any such Action with third party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Damages relating to such matter. In the event
that the Stockholder Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Holders shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this SECTION 15 to the amount of any such Parent Claim against
the Escrow Fund, or against the Indemnifying Holders directly, as the case may
be, with respect to such settlement. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, any costs and expenses of defense and investigation, including
court costs and attorneys fees incurred or suffered by the Parent Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense of any third-party claim alleging matters that would constitute a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty or any other matter specified in Section 15.1, whether or not it is
ultimately determined that there was such a breach or inaccuracy, will
constitute Damages subject to indemnification under Section 15.1.

15.6 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The Company Securityholders, the
Stockholder Representative and Parent agree to treat (and cause their
Affiliates to treat) any payments received pursuant to SECTION 15 as
adjustments to the Total Equity Consideration for all Tax purposes, to the
maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirements.

15.7 Investigation; No Company Recourse.

(a) The right to indemnification or any other remedy based on representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company in this Agreement or the
certificate required to be delivered by the Company pursuant to Sections
11.1(a), (l) and (p) shall not be affected by any investigation conducted by
any Parent Indemnified Party of any other Person at any time, or any knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) by any Parent Indemnified Party or any
other Person at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or the Effective Time, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement.

(b) An Indemnifying Holder shall have no right of contribution or other
recourse against Parent Indemnified Parties, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, assigns or
successors, for any indemnification claims asserted by any Parent Indemnified
Parties, it being acknowledged and agreed that the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the Company are solely for the benefit
of the Parent Indemnified Parties.

SECTION 16

TAXES

16.1 Pre-Closing Tax Period; Straddle Period. All Tax Returns for any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period, to the
extent filed or required to be filed after the Closing Date, shall be prepared
and filed by Parent. The Company and each Company Subsidiary will, unless
prohibited by applicable Tax Law, close its taxable period as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. If applicable Tax Law does not permit the
Company or a Company Subsidiary to close its taxable year on the Closing Date,
or in any case in which a Tax is assessed with respect to a taxable period
which includes the Closing Date (but does not end on that day) (a "Straddle
Period"), the Taxes, if any, attributable to a Straddle Period shall be
allocated (i) to the Company Stockholders for the period up to and including
the close of business on the Closing Date, and (ii) to the Parent for the
period subsequent to the Closing Date. Any allocation of income or deductions
required to determine any Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be
made by means of a closing of the books and records of the Company and each
Company Subsidiary as of the close of the Closing Date, provided that,
exemptions, allowances, deductions or periodic Taxes (such as property or
similar ad valorem Taxes) that are calculated on an annual or other periodic
basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number
of days in each such period.

16.2 Transfer Taxes. Any sales, use, transfer, gains, stamp, duties, recording
and similar Taxes incurred as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne by the Company
Stockholders. Parent shall prepare and file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (the "Transfer Tax
Returns") and timely remit all such Transfer Taxes; provided, for the
avoidance of doubt, that Parent may seek indemnification with respect to the
Transfer Taxes for which the Company Stockholders are liable pursuant to the
preceding sentence. If required by applicable Tax Law, the Company
Stockholders or the Stockholder Representative will join in the execution of
any Transfer Tax Return.

16.3 Dispute Resolution. Any dispute, controversy, or claim between Parent, on
the one hand, and the Indemnifying Holders or the Stockholder Representative,
on the other hand, arising out of or relating to the provisions of this
Agreement that relate to Taxes that cannot be resolved by negotiations between
Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall be submitted to KPMG LLP (or
if KPMG LLP cannot or will not serve, such other nationally recognized firm
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Stockholder Representative, the
"Accounting Firm") for resolution. The Accounting Firm shall control the
proceedings related to the dispute resolution and may request such evidence
and information as it deems necessary. The Accounting Firm shall promptly
determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the
Accounting Firm shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator),
based solely on written submissions by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
and shall render a written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the
resulting computation of any Tax, fee, deduction or other amount in dispute
which, absent manifest error, shall be conclusive and binding on Parent, the
Stockholder Representative, the Indemnifying Holders and their respective
Affiliates. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign
a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such items claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such items claimed by either
party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated
to and borne by Parent and the Indemnifying Holders, based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Accounting Firm's determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in
dispute total an amount equal to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in
favor of the Stockholder Representative's position, 60% of the costs of its
review would be borne by Parent and 40% of the costs would be borne by the
Indemnifying Holders.

SECTION 17

STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE

17.1 Powers of the Stockholder Representative.

(a) The Stockholder Representative shall have and may exercise all of the

any Action before a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, which
notice must be given to each Indemnifying Holder individually, as applicable),

and each of them, under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other such
agreement, document or instrument;

(iii) The power (subject to the provisions of Section 17.2 hereof) to (A)

hereby by arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and (E) take or forego any or

the judgment of the Stockholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing and all of the other terms, conditions and limitations of this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement;

(iv) The power to consult with legal counsel, independent public accountants
and other experts selected by it, solely at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Holders;

(v) The power to review, negotiate and agree to and authorize any payments
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any payment obligation, in each case,
on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders, as contemplated thereunder;

(vi) The power to waive any terms and conditions of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement providing rights or benefits to the Indemnifying Holders
(other than the payment of the consideration payable to such Indemnifying
Holders pursuant to SECTION 3 of this Agreement) in accordance with the terms
hereof and in the manner provided herein; and

(vii) The power to take any actions on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders in
regard to such other matters as are reasonably necessary for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or as the Stockholder Representative
reasonably believes are in the best interests of the Indemnifying Holders. (b) The Stockholder Representative represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:

(i) The Stockholder Representative has all necessary limited liability company
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and to carry out his, her or its obligations hereunder and
thereunder;

(ii) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Stockholder
Representative and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of the Stockholder Representative, enforceable
against the Stockholder Representative in accordance with its terms, subject
to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general
application affecting the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general
equity principles; and

(iii) At or prior to the Closing, the Escrow Agreement will be duly executed
and delivered by the Stockholder Representative and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of the Escrow Agreement by Parent and
the Escrow Agent, upon the Stockholder Representative's execution thereof, the
Escrow Agreement will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of
the Stockholder Representative, enforceable against the Stockholder
Representative in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar laws of general application affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors, and to general equity principles.

17.2 Claims by Parent.

(a) Upon receipt or notice of any Parent Claim pursuant to Sections 15.4 or
15.5, the Stockholder Representative shall give prompt notice of the amount
and details thereof (to the extent of the information in his, her or its
possession) to the Indemnifying Holders that are parties to that certain
Engagement Agreement (the "Engagement Agreement") to be entered into by and
among the Stockholder Representative, the Company and certain of the
Indemnifying Holders.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall have the discretion to take such
action as he, she or it shall determine to be in the best interest of all of
the Indemnifying Holders, taken as a whole, including authorizing the
distribution to any Parent Indemnified Party of any portion of the Escrow
Fund; provided, however, that, in any event, all Indemnifying Holders are
treated in substantially the same manner.

17.3 Notices. Any notice given to the Stockholder Representative will
constitute notice to each and all of the Indemnifying Holders at the time
notice is given to the Stockholder Representative. Any action taken by, or
notice or instruction received from, the Stockholder Representative will be
deemed to be action by, or notice or instruction from, each and all of the
Indemnifying Holders. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation may, and the Escrow Agent will, disregard any notice or
instruction received from any one or more individual Indemnifying Holders. 17.4 Agreement of the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder
Representative hereby agrees to do such acts, and execute further documents,
as shall be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement.

17.5 Reimbursement and Liability of Stockholder Representative.

(a) The Stockholder Representative shall serve as the Stockholder
Representative without compensation except as provided in the Engagement
Agreement; provided, however, that each Indemnifying Holder agrees to
reimburse the Stockholder Representative for such Indemnifying Holder's pro
rata share of all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in the performance of his, her or its duties
hereunder. Each Indemnifying Holder agrees that such Indemnifying Holder's pro
rata share of such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses may be distributed to the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of the Indemnifying Holders, from the
Escrow Fund at the request of the Stockholder Representative in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any Indemnifying
Holder for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative
while acting in good faith and without gross negligence or willful misconduct.
The Indemnifying Holders shall severally (but not jointly) indemnify and
defend the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder Representative
harmless against 100% (notwithstanding any other baskets, caps or other
limitations on the liability of the Indemnifying Holders, which the parties
acknowledge are not applicable to this Section 17.5(b) or to the
indemnification provisions contained in the Engagement Agreement) of any and
all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages,
obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and
court costs) (collectively, "Representative Losses") arising as a result of or
incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be taken by the
Stockholder Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, in each case as such Representative Loss is incurred or
suffered; provided, that in the event it is finally adjudicated that a
Representative Loss or any portion thereof was primarily caused by the bad
faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder
Representative, the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Indemnifying
Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss attributable to
such bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly
to the Stockholder Representative by the Indemnifying Holders, any such
Representative Losses may be recovered by the Stockholder Representative from
the amounts in the Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Indemnifying
Holders pursuant to the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of
distribution in accordance with written instructions delivered by the
Stockholder Representative to the Escrow Agent; provided, that while this
Section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the Escrow Fund,
this does not relieve the Indemnifying Holders from their obligation to
promptly pay such Representative Losses as such Representative Losses are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise.

17.6 Reliance on Stockholder Representative. Parent, Merger Sub, their
respective affiliates (including after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on the appointment
of Shareholder Representative Services LLC as Stockholder Representative and
treat such Stockholder Representative as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of each Indemnifying Holder and as having the
duties, power and authority provided for in this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement. None of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective affiliates (including
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) or the Escrow Agent shall
be liable to any Indemnifying Holder for any actions taken or omitted by them
in reliance upon any instructions, notice or other instruments delivered by
the Stockholder Representative. No resignation of the Stockholder
Representative shall become effective unless at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice of the replacement or resignation of such Stockholder
Representative shall be provided to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Parent,
Merger Sub, their respective affiliates (including after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely at
any time after receipt of any such notice on the most recent notice so
received. If the Stockholder Representative shall be unable or unwilling to
serve in such capacity, his, her or its successor who shall serve and exercise
the powers of the Stockholder Representative hereunder shall be appointed by a
written instrument signed by Indemnifying Holders holding a majority interest
in the Escrow Fund held in escrow at such time.

SECTION 18

RELEASE

18.1 Release. Effective for all purposes as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Consenting Securityholder, on behalf of itself and each
of its agents, trustees, beneficiaries, directors, officers, Affiliates,
Subsidiaries, estate, successors and assigns (each, a "Releasing Party"),
shall be deemed to have, and hereby does, unconditionally release and forever
discharge Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation (each, a "Beneficiary")
and each of such Beneficiary's respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, representatives, agents, members, stockholders, successors,
predecessors and assigns (each, a "Released Party") from any and all claims of
any nature and extent whatsoever such Releasing Party may have or assert
against any Released Parties relating to or arising out of facts and
circumstances occurring at any time on or prior to the Closing Date from (i)
any and all obligations or duties the Company or any Company Subsidiary might
have to such Consenting Securityholder, (ii) any and all claims of Liability,
whether legal or equitable, of every kind and nature, which such Consenting
Securityholder ever had, now has or may claim against any Released Party, in
each case, in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) any and all claims of Liability, whether legal or equitable,
of every kind and nature, which such Consenting Securityholder ever had, now
has or may claim against the Company, in each of clauses (i) through (iii)
whether such claim is known or unknown or whether or not the facts that could
give rise to or support such claim are known or should have been known (each
of the foregoing, a "Claim"). Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18.1,
the foregoing release shall not apply to any Claims (i) relating to Parent's
failure to pay the Total Equity Consideration in accordance with the Merger
Agreement or any related agreement to which Parent is a party and (ii) to the
extent applicable with respect to any Consenting Securityholder who is a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, for
(a) compensation not yet paid (including any amounts payable in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), (b)
reimbursement for expenses incurred by any such Consenting Securityholder in the ordinary course of his or her employment
which are reimbursable under the Company's or the applicable Company
Subsidiary's expense reimbursement policies, (c) accrued vacation, subject to
the Company's or the applicable Company Subsidiary's policies on accrual and
carry forward, and (d) indemnity by officers and directors of the Company in
their capacity as such whether pursuant to the Charter, an indemnification
agreement, this Agreement, an insurance policy or otherwise.

18.2 Specific Term of Agreement. The terms and provisions of this SECTION 18
are specific terms of the Merger, and the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Securityholders pursuant
to the Stockholder Written Consent shall constitute approval by such Company
Securityholders, as specific terms of the Merger, and the irrevocable
agreement of such Company Securityholders to be bound by such terms and
provisions.

aforesaid. Any notice to be given to any Indemnifying Holders hereunder shall
be given to the Stockholder Representative or, if for any reason there ceases
to be a Stockholder Representative, to each Indemnifying Holder.

19.2 Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements and other provisions
set forth in this Agreement and made by or on behalf of any of the parties
hereto shall bind and inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs and
permitted assigns of such party, whether or not so expressed. None of the
parties may assign, transfer or delegate any of their respective rights or
obligations under this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without
the Consent in writing of the Company, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative provided that, Parent and Merger Sub (including the Surviving
Corporation) may, without obtaining the prior written Consent of the Company
or the Stockholder Representative, assign any of its rights, or delegate any
of its obligations under this Agreement to (a) any Affiliate of Parent or (b)
any successor of such party by merger, by purchase of all or substantially all
of the assets or stock of Parent or otherwise. The Company and Stockholder
Representative shall execute such acknowledgments of such assignments in such
forms as Parent or Merger Sub (including the Surviving Corporation) may from
time to time reasonably request. Any purported assignment or delegation of
rights or obligations in violation of this Section 19.2 is void and of no
force or effect. 19.3 Severability. In the event that any one or more of the provisions
contained herein is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for
any reason in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining provisions
hereof shall not be in any way impaired or affected (so long as the economic
or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party), it being intended that each of
the parties' rights and privileges shall be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, and any such invalidity,
illegality and unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction (so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any party). If any court of
competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such court is hereby irrevocably authorized
to fashion and enforce another provision (instead of the provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that is valid, legal and enforceable and
carries out the intentions of the parties hereto under this Agreement and, in
the event that such court does not exercise such power, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith in an attempt to agree to another provision
(instead of the provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) that
is valid, legal and enforceable and carries out the parties' intentions to the
greatest lawful extent under this Agreement.

19.4 Third Parties. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended or shall
be construed to confer upon or give to any Person, other than the parties
hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, any rights or remedies
under or by reason of this Agreement or any other certificate, document,
instrument or agreement executed in connection herewith nor be relied upon
other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors or assigns. The
Parent Indemnified Parties not party hereto are entitled to the rights and
remedies of third party beneficiaries with respect to SECTION 15.

19.5 Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and all
matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement and any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with to any matter which is
the subject of this Agreement, including the validity hereof and the rights
and obligations of the parties hereunder, shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to Contracts
made and to be performed entirely in such State (without giving effect to the
conflicts of laws provisions thereof); provided, however, that the Merger
shall be governed by the DGCL. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any court of competent civil jurisdiction
sitting in the State of Delaware over any Action arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or related to any matter which is the subject of this Agreement and each party
hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of such Action may
be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waive any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of such Action brought in such court or any claim that such Action
brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a judgment in such Action may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by any
applicable Legal Requirement. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
consents to process being served by any party to this Agreement in any Action
by delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section
19.1 and consents to the exercise of jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware over it and
its properties with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of
or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
or the enforcement of any rights under this Agreement.

19.6 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

19.7 Entire Agreement, Not Binding Until Executed. This Agreement, including
the Disclosure Schedule, Schedules and Exhibits and the other agreements
referred to herein (including, the Offer Letters, the Escrow Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement), is complete, and all promises, representations,
understandings, warranties and agreements with reference to the subject matter
hereof, and all inducements to the making of this Agreement relied upon by all
the parties hereto, have been expressed herein or in such Disclosure Schedule,
Schedules, Exhibits or such other agreements and this Agreement, including
such Disclosure Schedule, Schedules, Exhibits and such other agreements,
supersede any prior understandings, negotiations, agreements or
representations by or among the parties, written or oral, to the extent they
related in any way to the subject matter hereof or thereof. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof is binding upon or
enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is executed and
delivered by all of the parties hereto.

19.8 Amendments; No Waiver. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, any
provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Effective
Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in
the case of an amendment, by each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a
waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided
that, after approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Company Stockholders and without their further approval, no amendment or
waiver shall reduce the amount or change the kind of consideration to be
received in exchange for any share of Company Stock. No course of dealing and
no failure or delay on the part of any party hereto in exercising any right,
power or remedy conferred by this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof
or otherwise prejudice such party's rights, powers and remedies. The failure
of any of the parties to this Agreement to require the performance of a term
or obligation under this Agreement or the waiver by any of the parties to this
Agreement of any breach hereunder shall not prevent subsequent enforcement of
such term or obligation or be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach
hereunder. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or remedy
conferred by this Agreement shall preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
