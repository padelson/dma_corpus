                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     Agreement (the "Agreement") entered into as of August 9, 2000 by and among
Sapient Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), Houston Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and Human Code,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). The Buyer, the Transitory
Subsidiary and the Company are referred to collectively herein as the "Parties."

     This Agreement contemplates a merger of the Transitory Subsidiary into the
Company. In such merger, the stockholders of the Company will receive common
stock of the Buyer in exchange for their capital stock of the Company.

     The Buyer, itself or through a wholly-owned overseas subsidiary of the
Buyer, has established the Transitory Subsidiary in order to effectuate the
merger of the Transitory Subsidiary into the Company. The Buyer, or such
overseas subsidiary, will contribute the Merger Shares (as defined below) into
the Transitory Subsidiary in order to effectuate the payment of the common stock
of Buyer to the Company Stockholders (as defined below) in exchange for their
Company Shares (as defined below).

     The parties intend, by executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code (defined below) and
to cause the Merger (defined below) to qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368 of the Code.

     Now, therefore, in consideration of the representations, warranties and
covenants herein contained, the Parties agree as follows.

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

     1.1 THE MERGER. Upon and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Transitory Subsidiary shall merge with and into the Company (with
such merger referred to herein as the "Merger") at the Effective Time (as
defined below). From and after the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving
Corporation"). The "Effective Time" shall be the time at which the Surviving
Corporation files a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents
prepared and executed in accordance with Section 251(c) of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the

Company ("Common Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below) and Common
Shares held in the Company's treasury) shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive (subject to the provisions of Section 1.9) such number of

Stock") as is equal to the Common Conversion Ratio (as defined in Section
1.5(c)).



                                      -2-

<PAGE>   9

        (b) Each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value
per share, and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share,
of the Company (collectively, the "Preferred Shares"; and, together with the
Common Shares, the "Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Preferred Shares held in
the Company's treasury) shall be converted into and represent the right to
receive (subject to the provisions of Section 1.9) such number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the Preferred Conversion Ratio (as defined
Section 1.5(c)).

        (c) The "Common Conversion Ratio" is .0995738. The "Preferred Conversion
Ratio" shall be the result obtained by multiplying the Common Conversion Ratio
by the number of Common Shares into which each Preferred Share is convertible

event of any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock split or similar event
affecting the Buyer Common Stock between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time. Company Stockholders shall be entitled to receive immediately
90% of the shares of Buyer Common Stock into which their Company Shares were
converted pursuant to this Section 1.5 (the "Initial Shares") pro rata based on
their respective percentage ownership of Company Common Stock assuming
conversion of Company Preferred Stock; the remaining 10% of the shares of Buyer
Common Stock into which their Company Shares were converted pursuant to this
Section 1.5, rounded to the nearest whole number (the "Escrow Shares") pro rata
based on their respective percentage ownership of Company Common Stock assuming
conversion of Company Preferred Stock, shall be deposited in escrow pursuant to

referred to herein as the "Merger Shares."

to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without payment of any
consideration therefor.

        (e) Each share of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of the
Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into and thereafter evidence one share of common stock,
$.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

     1.6 DISSENTING SHARES.

        (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenting Shares" means Company
Shares held as of the Effective Time by a Company Stockholder who has not voted
such Company Shares in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger
and with respect to which appraisal shall have been duly demanded and perfected
in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and not
effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior to the Effective Time. Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger
Shares, unless such Company Stockholder shall have forfeited his, her or its
right to appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation Law or properly
withdrawn, his, her or its demand for appraisal. If such Company Stockholder has
so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to appraisal of Dissenting
Shares, then (i) as of the occurrence of such event, such holder's Dissenting
Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted into and
represent



                                      -3-
<PAGE>   10

the right to receive the Merger Shares issuable in respect of such Company
Shares pursuant to Section 1.5, and (ii) promptly following the occurrence of
such event, the Buyer shall deliver to such Company Stockholder a certificate
representing 90% of the Merger Shares to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 1.5 (which shares shall be considered Initial Shares for all purposes
of this Agreement) and shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate
representing the remaining 10% of the Merger Shares to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.5 (which shares shall be considered Escrow Shares
for all purposes of this Agreement).

        (b) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to direct, with the assistance of the Company, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
Delaware General Corporation Law. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of the Buyer, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     1.7 FRACTIONAL SHARES. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Merger Shares shall be issued to former Company Stockholders upon the surrender
for exchange of certificates that, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented Company Shares converted into Merger Shares pursuant to Section 1.5
(including any Company Shares referred to in the last sentence of Section
1.6(a)) ("Certificates"), and such former Company Stockholders shall not be
entitled to any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions
or other rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any fractional
Merger Shares that would have otherwise been issued to such former Company
Stockholders. In lieu of any fractional Merger Shares that would have otherwise
been issued, each former Company Stockholder that would have been entitled to
receive a fractional Merger Share shall, upon proper surrender of such person's
Certificates, receive such whole number of Merger Shares as is equal to the
precise number of Merger Shares to which such person would be entitled, rounded
up or down to the nearest whole number (with a fractional interest equal to .5
rounded to the nearest odd number); provided that each such holder shall receive
at least one Merger Share.

     1.8 OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.

        (a) As of the Effective Time, all options to purchase Common Shares
issued by the Company pursuant to its stock option plans or otherwise
("Options"), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by the Buyer.
Immediately after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Option at the Effective
Time, such number of shares of Buyer Common Stock as is equal to the number of
Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of such Option multiplied by
the Common Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such
multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number). The exercise
price per share of each such assumed Option shall be equal to the exercise price
of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Common
Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The term,
exercisability, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, the "Code"), if
applicable, and all of the other terms of the Options shall otherwise remain
unchanged. To the extent that one of the individuals listed on Schedule 1.8



                                      -4-
<PAGE>   11

hereto exercises an Option or a New Option (as defined in Section 4.10) after
the Effective Time but prior to the termination of the Escrow Agreement, shares
representing 10% of the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued upon such
exercise, rounded to the nearest whole number (the "Escrow Option Shares"),
shall be deposited in escrow pursuant to Section 1.9 and shall be held and
disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Buyer shall be
entitled to deliver any Escrow Option Shares directly to the Escrow Agent.

        (b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time but in no event
later than 15 business days after the Effective Time, the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Options appropriate notices setting
forth such holders' rights pursuant to such Options, as amended by this Section
1.8, and the agreements evidencing such Options shall continue in effect on the
same terms and conditions (subject to the amendments provided for in this
Section 1.8 and such notice).

        (c) The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Options assumed in accordance with this Section 1.8. Within 15
business days after the Effective Date, which period shall be extended to the
extent necessary to enable the Buyer to obtain any required consents from
independent public accountants, the Buyer shall file a Registration Statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended,
the "Securities Act") with respect to all shares of Buyer Common Stock subject
to such Options that may be registered on a Form S-8, and shall use its
Reasonable Best Efforts (as defined in Section 4.1) to maintain the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement for so long as such Options remain
outstanding.

        (d) The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing, the consent from
each holder of an Option or a warrant for the purchase of any Company Shares
("Warrant") to the assumption (in the case of Options) or termination (in the
case of Warrants) of such Option or Warrant pursuant to this Section 1.8 (unless
such consent is not required under the terms of the applicable agreement,
instrument or plan).

     1.9 ESCROW.

        (a) On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate (issued in the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee as custodian
for the Company Stockholders) representing the Escrow Shares, as described in
Section 1.5, for the purpose of securing the indemnification obligations of the
Company Stockholders set forth in this Agreement. From time to time after the
Effective Date, Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent certificates (issued in
the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee as custodian for the Company
Stockholders) representing any Escrow Option Shares to be deposited in escrow
pursuant to Section 1.8. The Escrow Shares and the Escrow Option Shares shall be
held by the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms
thereof. The Escrow Shares and the Escrow Option Shares shall be held as a trust
fund and shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any
other judicial process of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and
disbursed solely for the purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.



                                      -5-
<PAGE>   12

        (b) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Company Stockholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of
all of the arrangements relating thereto, including without limitation the
placement of the Escrow Shares and Escrow Option Shares in escrow and the
appointment of the Indemnification Representatives.

     1.10 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, BY-LAWS, OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

Environmental Laws (as hereinafter defined) adopted, imposed or promulgated by

(i) neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries have ever and do not currently
generate, use, transport, handle or store any Hazardous Materials (as
hereinafter defined), the proper disposal of which has or will require any
material expenditure by the Company, (ii) there has been no generation, use,
handling, storage or disposal of any Hazardous Materials in violation of common
law or any applicable Environmental Law, or which would impose an obligation
under any Environmental Law, at any site or premises owned, occupied or leased,
at any time, by the Company or the Subsidiaries, nor (iii) has there been or is
there threatened any release of any Hazardous Materials on or at any such site
or premises in violation of common law or any applicable Environmental Law or

the Company or the Subsidiaries has been disposed of according to the
requirements of Environmental Laws, and neither the Company nor the Subsidiaries

the Company's business have all been obtained by the Company and are in full
force and effect. The Company has no knowledge that any property at any time

Governmental Entity or third party any requests for information, notices of
claim, demand letters, or other notification that they or it are or is or may be
potentially responsible with respect to any investigation or clean-up of
Hazardous Materials. There is no fact or circumstance that to the knowledge of
the Company would be likely to involve the Company, the Subsidiaries or the
Buyer in any litigation or proceeding brought with respect to an Environmental
Law or impose any liability upon the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Buyer
under any Environmental Law.

        (b) Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and the conduct and
operations of their respective businesses, are in compliance with, and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has received any notices of violation with
respect to, each applicable law (including rules, regulations, ordinances and
codes thereunder) of any federal, state, local or foreign government, or any
Governmental Entity (including without limitation any Environmental Law), except
for such violations or failures to comply as would not have or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

        (c) As used in this Agreement, the term "Hazardous Materials" shall mean
any pollutant, contaminant, hazardous substance, hazardous material, hazardous
waste or toxic waste, as defined in or regulated by any current Environmental
Law. The term "Environmental Laws" means any federal, state or local statute,
law, regulation, rule or ordinance, any judicial or administrative
interpretation thereof and the common law, regulating the use, generation,
handling, storage, transportation, discharge, emission, spillage, release or
threatened release of Hazardous Materials or relating to the protection of human
health or the environment.

     2.20 PERMITS. Each of the Company and the Subsidiaries possesses all
permits, licenses, registrations, certificates, orders, approvals, franchises,
variances and similar rights ("Permits") issued by or obtained from any
Governmental Entity or any other third party, that are required to conduct the
business of the Company or such Subsidiary as presently conducted, except where
the failure to obtain such Permit would not have or would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and each Permit is listed in
Section 2.20 of the Disclosure Schedule. Each Permit is in full force and effect
and will be in full force and effect immediately following the Closing and will
not expire or terminate solely as a result of the transactions contemplated by

gross revenues during either of the two most recent fiscal years or during the

customer for each such period. As of the date hereof, no Significant Customer
has canceled or otherwise terminated, or made any written threat to the Company
or any Subsidiary to cancel or otherwise terminate its relationship with the
Company or any Subsidiary for any reason including, without limitation the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or has at any time on or
after the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date decreased materially its usage of the
services or products of the Company or any Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has not knowingly breached, so as to provide a benefit to the
Company or any Subsidiary that was not intended by the parties, any agreement
with, or




                                      -21-

<PAGE>   28

engaged in any fraudulent conduct with respect to, any customer of the Company
or any Subsidiary. No Significant Customer has violated or breached any payment
obligation in excess of $25,000 to the Company or any Subsidiary (including any
violation or breach waived by the Company or any Subsidiary) or has indicated to
the Company or any Subsidiary that it wishes to return or receive a refund or
credit in excess of $25,000 for any services previously provided by the Company
or such Subsidiary. To the knowledge of the Company, no unfilled customer order
or commitment obligating the Company or any Subsidiary to perform services will
result in a loss to the Company or any Subsidiary upon completion of
performance.

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE BUYER
                          AND THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY

     Each of the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary represents and warrants to
the Company as follows.

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" means a
material adverse effect on the assets, business, condition (financial or
otherwise), results of operations or future prospects of the Buyer and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

     3.1 ORGANIZATION, QUALIFICATION AND CORPORATE POWER. Each of the Buyer and
the Transitory Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in corporate and tax good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The
Buyer is duly qualified to conduct business and is in corporate and tax good
standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and each other
jurisdiction in which the nature of its businesses or the ownership or leasing
of its properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.
The Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on the
businesses in which it is engaged and to own and use the properties owned and
used by it. The Buyer has furnished to the Company complete and accurate copies
of its Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws. The Buyer is not in default
under or in violation of any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or
By-laws.

     3.2 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the Buyer consists of
(a) 200,000,000 shares of Buyer Common Stock, of which 59,198,438 shares were
issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2000, and (b) 5,000,000 shares of
Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share, of which no shares are issued or
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock are
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of all
preemptive rights. All of the Merger Shares will be, when issued in accordance
with this Agreement, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
and free of all preemptive rights.

     3.3 AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTION. Each of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and (in the case of the Buyer) the Escrow Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Buyer
and the Transitory Subsidiary of this Agreement and (in the case of the Buyer)
the Escrow Agreement and the consummation by the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Buyer and Transitory Subsidiary, respectively. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Boards of Directors of the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary, at meetings duly called and held, by the unanimous vote of all
directors (i) determined that the Merger is fair and in the best interests of
the Buyer and its stockholders and (ii) adopted this Agreement in accordance
with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Buyer and the Transitory
Subsidiary and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms.

Merger as required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, neither the
execution and delivery by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary of this
Agreement or (in the case of the Buyer) the Escrow Agreement, nor the
consummation by the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, will (a) conflict with or violate any provision
of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary, (b) require on the part of the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary
any filing with, or any permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any
Governmental Entity, (c) with the exception of the loan agreement between Buyer
and Fleet National Bank dated June 30, 2000, conflict with, result in breach of,
constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default
under, result in the acceleration of obligations under, create in any party any
right to accelerate, terminate, modify or cancel, or require any notice, consent
or waiver under, any contract or instrument to which the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary is a party or by which either is bound or to which any of their
assets are subject, except for (i) any conflict, breach, default, acceleration,
termination, modification or cancellation which would not adversely affect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) any notice, consent
or waiver the absence of which would not adversely affect the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, or (d) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets and which would
adversely affect the Buyer's or the Transitory Subsidiary's performance under
this Agreement.

this Article VI and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the
defense of a suit or proceeding involving criminal liability or in which
equitable relief is sought against the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall
control such defense. The party not controlling such defense (the
"Non-controlling Party") may participate therein at its own expense; provided
that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the
Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or different defenses available
with respect to such suit or proceeding, the reasonable fees and expenses of one
counsel to the Indemnified Party in each jurisdiction shall be considered
"Damages" for purposes of this Agreement. The party controlling such defense
(the "Controlling Party") shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the
status of such suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in
good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect
thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such
information as it may have with respect to such suit or proceeding (including
copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served on
such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document
evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist
the Controlling Party in the defense of such suit or proceeding. The
Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the
entry of any judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

        (b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VI, an
Indemnified Party shall give written notification (a "Claim Notice") to the
Indemnifying Party which contains (i) a description and the amount (the "Claimed
Amount") of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred in
connection with the commencement of any suit or proceeding relating to a third
party claim or in connection with any claim which could reasonably be accounted
for as a contingent liability under GAAP by the Indemnified Party, (ii) a
statement that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this
Article VI for such Damages and a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor,
and (iii) a demand for payment (in the manner provided in paragraph (c) below)
in the amount of such Damages. If the Indemnified Party is the Buyer, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver a copy of the Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent.

        (c) Within 20 days after receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying
Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response (the "Response")
in which the Indemnifying Party shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response shall
be accompanied by a payment by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party
of the Claimed Amount, by check or by wire transfer; provided that if the
Indemnified Party is the Buyer, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent and the Buyer, as part of the Response, a written notice executed
by the Indemnifying Party instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute to the
Buyer such number of Escrow Shares as have an aggregate Value (as defined in the
Escrow Agreement) equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the
"Agreed Amount") (in which case the Response shall be accompanied by a payment
by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of the Agreed Amount, by
check or by wire transfer; provided that if the Indemnified Party is the Buyer,
the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Escrow Agent and the Buyer, as part
of the Response, a written notice executed by the Indemnifying Party instructing
the Escrow Agent to distribute to the Buyer such number of Escrow Shares as have
an aggregate Value equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If the
Indemnifying Party in the Response disputes its liability for all or part of the
Claimed Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good
faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 30
days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such Response, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right, after
first complying with the requirements of Section 9.9(a), to commence litigation
for purposes of resolving the dispute.

        (d) For purposes of this Section 6.3 and the last two sentences of
Section 6.4, (i) if the Indemnifying Stockholders comprise the Indemnifying
Party, any references to the Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to
an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments provided for in Section
6.3 or Section 6.4) shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnification
Representatives, and (ii) if the Indemnifying Stockholders comprise the
Indemnified Party, any references to the Indemnified Party (except provisions
relating to an obligation to make or a right to receive any payments provided
for in Section 6.3 or Section 6.4) shall be deemed to refer to the
Indemnification Representatives. The Indemnification Representatives shall have
full power and authority on behalf of each Indemnifying Stockholder to take any
and all actions on behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and
execute or waive any and all rights of, the Indemnifying Stockholders under this
Article VI. The




                                      -39-

<PAGE>   46

Indemnification Representatives shall have no liability to any Indemnifying
Stockholder for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Indemnifying
Stockholders pursuant to this Article VI.

     6.4 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, the Company Certificate or the Buyer
Certificate shall (a) survive the Closing and any investigation at any time made
by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party and (b) shall expire on the date one
year following the Closing Date except the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 2.12 (and the portion of the Company certificate relating
thereto) shall survive until 30 days following expiration of all statutes of
limitation applicable to the matters referred to therein. If an Indemnified
Party delivers to an Indemnifying Party, before expiration of a representation
or warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation or
warranty, or a notice that the Indemnified Party reasonably expects to incur
Damages as a result of a breach of such representation or warranty (an "Expected
Claim Notice"), then such representation or warranty shall survive until the
resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding or
written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim Notice has been given is
definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly so notify the Indemnifying Party; and if the
Indemnified Party has delivered a copy of the Expected Claim Notice to the
Escrow Agent and Escrow Shares have been retained in escrow after the
Termination Date (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) with respect to such
Expected Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
promptly deliver to the Escrow Agent a written notice executed by both parties
instructing the Escrow Agent to distribute such retained Escrow Shares to the
Indemnifying Stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

     6.5 LIMITATIONS.

        (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the aggregate
liability of the Indemnifying Stockholders, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on
the other hand, for Damages under this Article VI shall not exceed the Escrow
Shares, and (ii) neither the Indemnifying Stockholders nor the Buyer shall be
liable under this Article VI unless and until the aggregate Damages for which
they or it would otherwise be liable exceed $250,000 (at which point the
Indemnifying Stockholders and the Buyer shall become liable for the aggregate
Damages, and not just amounts in excess of $250,000); provided that the
limitation set forth in clause (ii) above shall not apply to (A) a claim
pursuant to Section 6.1(a) relating to a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 2.6(d) or (B) a claim pursuant to Section 6.1(b)
or (d).

        (b) Except with respect to claims based on fraud or pursuant to Section
6.1(b), the Escrow Agreement and the New Options shall be the exclusive means
for the Buyer to collect any Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification
under this Article VI.

        (c) Except with respect to claims based on fraud or pursuant to Section
6.1(b), after the Closing, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this
Article VI, the Escrow Agreement and the New Options shall be the exclusive
remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to claims resulting from or
relating to any breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform
any covenant contained in this Agreement and no Company Stockholder or any
former stockholder, optionholder, warrantholder, director, officer, employee or
agent of the




                                      -40-

<PAGE>   47

Company shall have any personal liability to the Buyer of the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing in connection with the Merger.

        (d) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party under this
Article VI with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by any net
proceeds received by such Indemnified Party or an Affiliate, with respect to the
Damages to which such indemnity claim relates, from an insurance carrier,
indemnities from third parties or in the case of third party claims, by any
amount actually recovered by the party or parties seeking indemnification or
their affiliates pursuant to counterclaims made by them directly relating to the
facts giving rise to such third party claim.

        (e) No Indemnifying Stockholder shall have any right of indemnification
or contribution against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
any breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties or covenants
under this Agreement.

        (f) The liability of the Company Stockholders under this Article VI (i)
for any claim for Damages that is satisfied pursuant to the Escrow Agreement
shall be allocated among the Company Stockholders as provided in the Escrow
Agreement, (ii) for any claim against an individual Company Stockholder based
upon Section 6.1(b) or fraud that is not satisfied pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement shall be several and not joint, and (iii) for any other claim shall be
joint and several among the Company Stockholders.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                               REGISTRATION RIGHTS

     The provisions of this Article VII shall not apply in the event that an S-4
Registration Statement is required to be filed by the Buyer pursuant to Section
4.3(f).

     7.1 REGISTRATION OF SHARES.

        The Buyer shall file with the SEC, within 15 business days following
the Closing, which period shall be extended to the extent necessary to enable
the Buyer to obtain any required consents from independent public accountants, a
registration statement on Form S-3 covering the resale to the public by the
Company Stockholders of the Merger Shares (the "Stockholder Registration
Statement"). The Buyer shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to cause the
Stockholder Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon
as practicable after the filing thereof and to cause the Stockholder
Registration Statement to remain effective until the date two years after the
Closing Date or such earlier time as all of the Merger Shares covered by the
Stockholder Registration Statement have been sold pursuant thereto.

     7.2 LIMITATIONS ON REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

        (a) The Buyer may, by written notice to the Company Stockholders, (i)
delay the filing or effectiveness of any registration statement filed or to be
filed pursuant to this Article VII or (ii) suspend any registration statement
filed pursuant to this Article VII after effectiveness and require that the
Company Stockholders immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to such
registration statement, in the event that:





                                      -41-

<PAGE>   48

              (x) the Buyer is engaged in any activity or transaction or
preparations or negotiations for any activity or transaction which the Buyer
desires to keep confidential and the Board of Directors of the Buyer determines
in good faith that it would be detrimental to the Buyer for such registration to
be effected at such time; provided that the Buyer shall have the right to defer
or suspend the filing or effectiveness of a registration statement only once and
only for a period of not more than 90 days; provided, further, however, that the
Buyer may not exercise its right under this subparagraph (1) unless all
directors and executive officers of the Buyer are also prevented from trading in
the securities of the Buyer during such period that the Company Stockholders are
prevented from trading in the securities of the Buyer hereunder and (2) unless
the Buyer has also delayed or suspended all other registration statements of the
Buyer (other than any registration statements on Form S-8); or

              (y) the Buyer is preparing to file a registration statement (other
than a registration statement on Form S-8 or any successor form) with the SEC
for the purpose of registering under the Securities Act any securities to be
publicly offered and sold by the Buyer, provided that the Buyer pursues the
preparation, filing and effectiveness of such registration statement with
diligence, the lead underwriter determines that it is necessary to delay or
suspend a registration statement filed (or to be filed) for the benefit of
Company Stockholders pursuant to this Article VII in order to effect such Buyer
registration statement and Buyer agrees to register all outstanding Merger
Shares on such registration statement..

        (b) If the Buyer delays or suspends a registration statement filed
pursuant to this Article VII or requires the Company Stockholders to cease sales
of shares pursuant to paragraph (a) above, the Buyer shall, subject to Section
7.2(c), as promptly as practicable following the earlier of termination of the
90 day period referenced in Section 7.2(a) above or the circumstance which
entitled the Buyer to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to file or
reinstate the effectiveness of such registration statement and/or give written
notice to all Company Stockholders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to
such registration statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in
the registration statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of
the Securities Act, the Buyer shall enclose such revised prospectus with the
notice to Company Stockholders given pursuant to this paragraph (b), and the
Company Stockholders shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to any
registration statement other than by means of such revised prospectus.

     7.3 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

        (a) In connection with the filing by the Buyer of any registration
statement to be filed pursuant to this Article VII, the Buyer shall furnish to
each Company Stockholder such number of copies of the prospectus in conformity
with the requirements of the Securities Act as reasonably requested by such
Company Stockholder.

        (b) The Buyer shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to register or
qualify the Merger Shares covered by any registration statement filed pursuant
to this Article VII under the securities laws of each state of the United
States; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Buyer shall not be required in connection
with this paragraph (b) to qualify as a foreign corporation or execute a general
consent to service of process in any jurisdiction.






                                      -42-

<PAGE>   49


        (c) If the Buyer has delivered preliminary or final prospectuses to the
Company Stockholders and after having done so the prospectus is amended or
supplemented to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Buyer
shall promptly notify the Company Stockholders and, if requested by the Buyer,
the Company Stockholders shall immediately cease making offers or sales of
shares under the registration statement and return all prospectuses to the
Buyer. The Buyer shall promptly provide the Company Stockholders with revised or
supplemented prospectuses and, following receipt of the revised or supplemented
prospectuses, the Company Stockholders shall be free to resume making offers and
sales under the registration statement.

        (d) The Buyer shall pay the costs and expenses incurred by it in
complying with its obligations under this Article VII, including all
registration and filing fees, Nasdaq listing fees, fees and expenses of counsel
for the Buyer, and fees and expenses of accountants for the Buyer, but excluding
(i) any brokerage fees, selling commissions or underwriting discounts incurred
by the Company Stockholders in connection with sales under any registration
statement filed pursuant to this Article VII and (ii) the fees and expenses of
any counsel retained by Company Stockholders.

     7.4 REQUIREMENTS OF COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS. The Buyer shall not be required
to include any Merger Shares in any registration statement filed pursuant to
this Article VII unless:

        (a) the Company Stockholder owning such shares furnishes to the Buyer in
writing such information regarding such Company Stockholder and the proposed
sale of Merger Shares by such Company Stockholder as the Buyer may reasonably
request in writing in connection with such registration statement or as shall be
required in connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities law
authorities;

        (b) such Company Stockholder shall have provided to the Buyer its
written agreement:

           (i) to indemnify the Buyer and each of its directors and officers
against, and hold the Buyer and each of its directors and officers harmless
from, any losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable
attorneys fees) to which the Buyer or such directors and officers may become
subject by reason of any statement or omission in any registration statement
filed pursuant to this Article VII made in reliance upon, or in conformity with,
a written statement by such Company Stockholder furnished pursuant to this
Section 7.4; and

           (ii) to sell no more than 50% of the Initial Shares received by such
Company Stockholder during the two week period following the date the
Stockholder Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC.

        (c) As a condition to including Merger Shares in any registration
statement to be filed pursuant to this Article VII, the Buyer may require each
Company Stockholder to agree to engage Goldman, Sachs & Co., to act as such
Company Stockholder's broker, dealer or other intermediary in connection with
sales to be made pursuant to this registration statement.

     7.5 INDEMNIFICATION. The Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Company Stockholder whose shares are included in a registration statement to be
filed pursuant to this Article VII against any losses, claims, damages, expenses
or liabilities to which such Company Stockholder may become subject by reason of
any untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration statement
or any omission to state therein a fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of or are based upon
information furnished to the Buyer by or on behalf of such Company Stockholder
for use in such registration statement. The Buyer shall have the right to assume
the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for which the Buyer may be
responsible for indemnification under this Section 7.5.

     7.6 ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS. A Company Stockholder may not assign any of its
rights under this Article VII except in connection with the transfer of some or
all of his, her or its Merger Shares to a child or spouse, or trust for their
benefit or, in the case of a partnership, to the partners of such partnership
pursuant to a pro rata distribution, PROVIDED each such transferee agrees in a
written instrument delivered to the Buyer to be bound by the provisions of this
Article VII.

the Buyer in the event the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary is in breach of

<PAGE>   51

        (d) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to

failed to receive the Requisite Stockholder Approval;

        (e) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before September 30,
2000 by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under Section 5.1 or
5.2 hereof (unless the failure results primarily from a breach by the Buyer or
the Transitory Subsidiary of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement);

        (f) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
the Buyer and the Transitory Subsidiary if the Closing shall not have occurred

contained in this Agreement); or

        (g) the Company may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to

of this Agreement or the Merger, in which case Buyer shall reimburse the
Company, upon receipt of written bills, for all the reasonable legal and

incurred by the Company in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and provided that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this paragraph 8.1(g) shall not be available to the Company when the
Company is at that time in material breach of the Agreement.

     8.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If any Party terminates this Agreement pursuant

     9.1 PRESS RELEASES AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Neither the Company nor any
Company Stockholder shall issue any press release or other public disclosure
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement without the prior written
approval of the Buyer. The Buyer will not issue a press release announcing the
signing of this Agreement without first providing the Company with an
opportunity to review and comment on the proposed release; provided, however,
that this provision shall not be deemed to restrict the right of the Buyer to
make any public announcement that it reasonably determines is required by law or
stock market regulations to be made.

     9.2 NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. This Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any person other than the Parties and their respective

Party, as the case may be, desiring to commence litigation will provide written
notice to the other side demanding that the parties engage, for a period of 30
days from the date of such demand notice, in non-binding mediation for purposes
of seeking to resolve such dispute. Such mediation shall be coordinated through
J.A.M.S./Endispute or its successor, or if no such successor exists, through a
mediator mutually agreed upon by the parties to the dispute. The cost of any
mediation shall be borne one-half by each of the parties to the mediation.
Following the expiration of such 30-day period, any Party, the Indemnifying
Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, may commence litigation with
respect to the subject matter of the dispute and any related matters.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 9.9 shall be construed as
limiting in any way (i) the right of a Party to seek injunctive relief from any
court of competent jurisdiction or (ii) the right of a Party to commence
litigation without complying with the requirements of this Section if doing so
is necessary to avoid the expiration of an applicable statute of limitations.

        (b) If any Party, the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party
wishes to commence litigation relating to the subject matter of or under this
Agreement, such party will commence such litigation exclusively in the state or
federal courts sitting in the State of Delaware. Each of the Parties (i) submits
to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought pursuant to this Section 9.9(b) and (ii) agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or





                                      -47-

proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each of the parties
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or
proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might
be required of any other party with respect thereto.

        (c) Any Party may make service on another Party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be served at the address and in
the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.7. Nothing in this
Section, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by law.

     9.10 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The Parties may mutually amend any provision
of this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that any amendment effected subsequent to the Requisite Stockholder Approval
shall be subject to any restrictions contained in the Delaware General
Corporation Law. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all of the Parties. No waiver
of any right or remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall be in
writing and signed by the Party giving such waiver. No waiver by any Party with
respect to any default or breach of any representation or warranty or covenant
hereunder shall be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default or breach
of any representation or warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any
rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

     9.11 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the body making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified.

     9.12 CONSTRUCTION.

        (a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Party.

        (b) Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.

     9.13 INCORPORATION OF EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES. The Exhibits and Schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

     9.14 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that
the other Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific
terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly,





                                      -48-

<PAGE>   55

each of the Parties agrees that the other Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof.

     9.15 FURTHER ASSURANCES. In case at any time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
Parties will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
such further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may
request, all at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the
requesting Party is entitled to indemnification therefore under Article 8
above).
