Corporation and until such officers successor is duly elected and qualified,
or such officers earlier resignation or removal.

 

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Outstanding Capital Stock._

 

(a) _Conversion of Outstanding Capital Stock and Membership Interests_.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, the Company or any Stockholder:

 

(i) each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Purchase Price
Measurement Time, other than any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
and represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the Closing
Per Share Cash Consideration and (B) with respect to any future Distribution,
the Distribution Per Share Amount _minus_ the Closing Per Share Cash
Consideration received with respect to such share _minus_ the amount of
Distributions received with respect to such share in connection with any prior
Distribution (the "Adjusted Share Distribution Amount"), in each case payable
when and as provided herein (all amounts referred to in clause (i) of this
_Section 2.2(a)_ , the "Merger Consideration"); and

 

(ii) each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Merger
Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section_ _ _ _2.2(a)_ , shares of
Common Stock outstanding as of the Purchase Price Measurement Time and held
by a holder who has demanded appraisal for such shares ("Dissenting Shares")
in accordance with the DGCL shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the applicable Merger 

 



16  Consideration, unless such holder withdraws or otherwise loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) its right to appraisal, and each holder of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to such rights with respect to such
Dissenting Shares as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL. If after the Effective Time such holder withdraws or loses (through
failure to perfect or otherwise) its right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto,
and any right of such holder to a judicial appraisal of the Dissenting Shares
shall be extinguished.

Section 2.3 _Option Payments._

 

(a) The Company will take all action necessary such that at the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Option shall terminate and be cancelled and,
thereafter, the holder of each outstanding Company Option shall only be
entitled to the payments (if any) set forth in this _Section 2.3_ with respect
to such cancelled Company Options. Each Holder of a Vested Company
Option shall be entitled to receive the following:

(i) if such Vested Company Option is an In-the-Money Company Option at
the Purchase Price Measurement Time (without regard to any future
Distributions), an amount in cash equal to (A) (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option _times_ (y) the
Closing Per Share Cash Consideration _minus_ (z) the aggregate exercise price
of such In-the-Money Company Option as of the Purchase Price Measurement Time,
and (B) with respect to any future Distribution, an amount in cash equal to
(1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company
Option _times_ the difference between (x) the Distribution Per Share Amount
_minus_ (y) the Closing Per Share Cash Consideration, _minus_ (2) the amount
of Distributions received with respect to such In-the-Money Company Option in
connection with any prior Distribution;

(ii) if such Vested Company Option is not an In-the-Money Company Option at
the Purchase Price Measurement Time but becomes an In-the-Money Company Option
at the time of any Distribution, an amount in cash equal to (I) (x)the number
of shares of Common Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Option _times_
(y)(A) the Distribution Per Share Amount _minus_ (B) the per share exercise
price of such In-the-Money Company Option as of the Purchase Price Measurement
Time, minus (II) the amount of Distributions received with respect to such
In-the-Money Company Option in connection with any prior Distribution (the
amount payable pursuant to this _Section 2.3(ii)_ or pursuant to _Section
2.3(a)(i)(B)_ , as applicable, the "Adjusted Option Distribution Amount"); or

(iii) if such Vested Company Option is at no time an In-the-Money Company
Option, then no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(b) If a Company Option is not a Vested Company Option, then no payment shall
be made with respect thereto.

 



17 (c) The payments described in _Section_ _ _ _2.3(a)_ hereof are referred
to herein as the "Option Payments" and each an "Option Payment"
Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
when an Option Payment becomes payable at the Closing or at any other
time (including when such Option Payment is to be made from the Stockholder
Reserve Account), such Option Payment shall be paid to the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for payment through its payroll system
to the applicable Holder of the Company Option giving rise to such Option
Payment, less all applicable withholding Taxes. The amount of any such
withholding Taxes shall be treated as having been received by the recipient of
the Option Payment for all purposes of this Agreement. 

(d) Until a Person entitled to an Option Payment submits an instruction letter
within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date or, with respect to
Distributions as provided by _Section 2.3(a)(ii)_ , within sixty (60) days
after the date of the first such Distribution, in the form and substance
substantially similar to _Exhibit_ _ _ _F_ attached hereto (an "Instruction
Letter"), neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Stakeholder Representative
shall be required to pay such Person the cash to which it would otherwise have
been entitled.

 

Section 2.4 _Computation of the Closing Cash Consideration._

 

No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent an estimated consolidated
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Purchase Price Measurement
Time (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") and a certificate signed on
behalf of the Company by an executive officer of the Company (the "Closing
Date Statement"), setting forth, in each case as of the anticipated Purchase
Price Measurement Time, a good faith estimate of (a) Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Net Working Capital"), (b) the Cash of the Acquired Companies (the
"Estimated Closing Cash"), (c) Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing
Indebtedness"), (d) the Unpaid Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Unpaid
Transaction Expense Amount"), (e) Current Income Tax Liabilities (f) the
Transaction Tax Benefits Amount, (g) calculations in reasonable detail of the
Net Working Capital Difference (the "Estimated Net Working Capital
Difference"), (h) the Closing Cash Consideration calculated from the
foregoing (the "Estimated Closing Cash Consideration") and (i) the Closing Per
Share Cash Consideration calculated from the foregoing (the "Estimated Closing
Per Share Cash Consideration") and the components thereof, which in each case
have been prepared in good faith in accordance with the Accounting
Methodology. Parent shall be entitled to review, comment on and request
reasonable changes to the Closing Date Statement, and, subject to _Section
6.4_ , the Company shall provide Parent and its representatives with
reasonable access to all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared by or available to the Company or its representatives in
connection with its preparation of the Closing Date Statement and its
calculation of the amounts shown in the Closing Date Statement and to finance
personnel of the Acquired Companies and any other information which
Parent reasonably requests, and the Company shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, cooperate with Parent and its representatives in
connection therewith. The Company shall consider Parents proposed changes to
the Closing Date Statement in good faith but shall not be required to accept
any such proposed changes. If the Company accepts any changes, references to
the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Cash, the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness, the Estimated Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount, the
Estimated Closing Cash Consideration and the Estimated Closing Per Share Cash
Consideration shall be deemed to be references to such items as set forth in
the Closing Date Statement but revised to reflect the changes accepted by the
Company.

 



18 Section 2.5 _The Closing._

 

(a) _The Closing; The Closing Date_. The closing of the transactions
contemplated hereby (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Dechert LLP, 2929 Arch Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104 at 10:00 a.m.
local time no later than on the third (3rd) (subject to the next sentence)
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in _Article_ _ _ _VII_ (excluding those conditions which by their
terms must be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction

date as Parent and the Stakeholder Representative may agree in writing;
_provided_ that, without the written consent of the Stakeholder
Representative, the Closing shall not take place prior to July 1, 2016. If
the Company estimates no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, that Cash of the Acquired Companies as of the anticipated
Purchase Price Measurement Time would otherwise exceed Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000.00), the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
use the excess to reduce Indebtedness, and may extend the date by which
Closing is otherwise required to occur for up to two Business Days. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date." For
financial accounting and Tax purposes, to the extent permitted by Law, the
Closing shall be deemed to have become effective as of the Purchase Price
Measurement Time. 

(b) _Deliveries by Parent at Closing_. At the Closing, Parent shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Stakeholder Representative

(i) each of the Transaction Agreements to which Parent is contemplated to be a
party, duly executed by Parent;

(iii) such other agreements and documents as may be reasonably requested by
the Company or the Stakeholder Representative.

to be a party, duly executed by the Company;

(vi) evidence of the termination of the Affiliate Contracts listed on Section
2.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms thereof
(including the delivery of all required notices) effective as of and
contingent upon the Closing in each case without any remaining Liability of
any kind on the part of any Acquired Company, Parent or any of their
respective affiliates as a result of or in connection with such termination or
such Contract;

 

(vii) evidence of the repayment and extinguishment in full of all Closing
Indebtedness of any Acquired Companies at or as of the Closing effective as
of the Effective Time without any further Liability to the Acquired Companies,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to the extent not so repaid
and extinguished prior to Closing: (A) executed payoff letters or final
invoices, as applicable, from each lender, creditor, noteholder or other
counterparty to which such Indebtedness is owing (whether or not then due and
payable) (or such counterpartys agent), in each case (1) setting forth the
amount to be paid at Closing, together with wire transfer instructions, (2)
evidencing that the payment of such amount would result in the full repayment,
satisfaction, release and discharge of all current and future obligations of
the Acquired Companies (and, in the case of hedging, swap or similar
agreements, the complete unwinding and settlement of such arrangements) in
respect of such item and of all current and future Encumbrances relating to
such item, other than any inchoate liability that survives the repayment,
satisfaction, release and discharge under the terms of such Indebtedness, and
(3) contemplating the delivery of UCC-3 termination statements and mortgage
releases that when filed or recorded, as the case may be, will be sufficient
to release any and all Encumbrances relating to such item, if applicable, and
(B) at the Closing, all UCC-3 termination statements and mortgage releases, if
any, relating to assets, properties or rights secured by such Indebtedness (
_provided_ that, in respect of the letter of credit identified in item 2 of
Section 3.14(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (or renewal thereof, the
"LC") Parent shall as of the Closing procure a new letter of credit,
post cash collateral, provide a guaranty or make similar credit support
arrangements, reasonably satisfactory to the Agents and lenders under the
Credit Agreement, to backstop the full amount of such LC);

 

(viii) a non-solicitation and confidentiality agreement attached hereto as
_Exhibit G_ (the "Non-Solicitation Agreements") duly executed by each of the
CSC Stockholders; and

(ix) such other agreements and documents as may be reasonably requested by
Parent.

Section 2.6 _Payments at Closing._

 

(a) _Payment of the Closing Cash Consideration_. At the Closing, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall pay to the Paying Agent an amount in cash equal
to the product of (x) the Closing Per Share Cash Consideration multiplied by
(y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, which amount 

 



20  shall be held by the Paying Agent for the benefit of the Holders to make the
payments contemplated by this _Section 2.6(a)_ to each Holder of Common Stock
(following such Holders delivery of a duly completed and validly executed
Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_ ), of
an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number of shares of Common Stock held
by each such Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, times (y) the
Closing Per Share Cash Consideration. Such payments are to be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with instructions
specified by the Paying Agent at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Common Stock shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company, except as provided
herein or by Law. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Common Stock shall
thereafter be made.

(b) _Other Payments_. At the Closing, in addition to the payments required to
be made pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.6(a)_ , Parent shall, or shall cause the
Company to, pay at the direction of and on behalf of the Company, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to payment instructions
provided by the Company, (i) the Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies listed
in _Section_ _ _ _2.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, as indicated in
payoff letters from the holders thereof, (ii) the Unpaid Transaction Expenses
for which the Company has delivered to Parent an invoice and payment
instructions and (iii) all Option Payments payable at the Effective Time
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.3_  (with all such Option Payments to be paid
through the payroll system of the Surviving Corporation or one of its
Subsidiaries within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time).

 

(c) _Procedures for Payment_. The Paying Agent shall effect the exchange of
cash for certificates which, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented shares of Common Stock entitled to payment pursuant to _Section_ _
_ _2.2(a)_ (the "Certificates"). Within ten (10) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to each Stockholder a letter of
transmittal, in form and substance substantially similar to _Exhibit_ _ _ _H_
attached hereto (the "Letter of Transmittal") and instructions for use in
surrendering certificates to the Paying Agent (or otherwise complying with
the final sentence of this _Section 2.6(c)_ ) in exchange for the Closing Per
Share Cash Consideration and the rights as specified in _Section 2.2(a)_ , in
each case with such changes thereto as are required by the Paying Agent, and
the information required by Section 262 of the DGCL in a form that is
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Prior to or as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, each Stockholder who has not already
delivered such documents prior to the Effective Time, shall surrender to the
Paying Agent Certificates representing the shares of Common Stock held by such
Stockholder at the Effective Time, and each Stockholder shall deliver to the
Paying Agent a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions therein and any other documents as may be
reasonably required pursuant to such instructions. The Paying Agent
shall promptly provide a copy of each Letter of Transmittal, and deliver the
Certificates and any related stock powers, to Parent. Promptly following the
later to occur of (x) the Effective Time and (y) delivery by a Stockholder of
its Certificates and executed Letter of Transmittal to the Paying Agent, the
Paying Agent shall deliver to such Stockholder the payment to which such
Stockholder is entitled under _Section_ _ _ _2.6(a)_. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate shall represent solely the right to receive the payment
to which such Stockholder is entitled under _Section_ _ _ _2.6(a)_ , without
interest, and, with respect to any future Distributions, the Adjusted
Share Distribution Amount in accordance with _Section 2.2(a)(i)_.
Notwithstanding the

 



21  foregoing, if any such Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then, upon the making of an affidavit of such fact by the
Stockholder claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the
providing of an indemnity by such Stockholder to the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent against any claim that may be made against the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the payment contemplated by _Section_ _ _ _2.6(a)_ , without
interest, and, with respect to any future Distributions, the Adjusted Share
Distribution Amount in accordance with _Section 2.2(a)(i)_.

(d) _Return of Funds_. Any portion of the amounts deposited with the
Paying Agent that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall, upon request by Parent,
be delivered by the Paying Agent to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent (or Guarantor) for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claims for the payment to Stockholders
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent will be liable to any Person with respect to any cash delivered to a
public official in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law. If any amounts payable in accordance with this _Article II_
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such amounts, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior
to the date on which such amounts would otherwise escheat or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, will become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.7 _Adjustment of Pre-Closing Estimates._

(a) _Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet_. No later than sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Stakeholder Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the Purchase Price Measurement
Time (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared by the Company in
good faith in accordance with the Accounting Methodology, (ii) a certificate
of an executive officer on behalf of the Company, certifying that the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Methodology and (iii) a reasonably detailed calculation as of the
Purchase Price Measurement Time by the Company of (A) the Net Working Capital
(the "Preliminary Net Working Capital"), (B) the Cash of the Acquired
Companies (the "Preliminary Closing Cash"), (C) the Indebtedness (the
"Preliminary Closing Indebtedness"), (D) the Unpaid Transaction Expenses (the
"Preliminary Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount"), (E) the calculation in
reasonable detail of the Net Working Capital Difference (the "Preliminary Net
Working Capital Difference"), (E) the Preliminary Adjusted Closing Cash
Consideration calculated from the foregoing and (F) such Preliminary Adjusted
Closing Cash Consideration _minus_ the Closing Cash Consideration, in each
case as determined in a manner consistent with the Preliminary Closing Balance
Sheet (the "Preliminary Closing Statement").

 



22 (b) _Review by the Stakeholder Representative_. The Stakeholder Representative
shall have forty-five (45) days following receipt of the Preliminary Closing
Statement to review the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the amounts
shown in the Preliminary Closing Statement and to notify the Company in
writing if it disputes any of the items or amounts shown in the Preliminary
Closing Statement (a "Dispute Notice"), specifying the items and amounts in
dispute and the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and, to the extent
known, the values that it believes in good faith to be correct. Only such
items included in the Dispute Notice as originally delivered or any items that
result therefrom may be disputed by the Stakeholder Representative. In
connection with the Stakeholder Representatives review and any disputes
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.7(c)_ , the Stakeholder Representative and its
representatives shall have reasonable access to all relevant work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by the Company or its
representatives in connection with its preparation of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and its calculation of the amounts shown in the Preliminary
Closing Statement and to finance personnel of the Acquired Companies and any
other information which the Stakeholder Representative reasonably requests,
and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, cooperate with the
Stakeholder Representative and its representatives in connection therewith.

 

(c) _Dispute Notice_. In the event the Stakeholder Representative does not
timely deliver a Dispute Notice within forty-five (45) days following receipt
of the Preliminary Closing Statement, then the Preliminary Closing
Indebtedness, the Preliminary Net Working Capital and the Preliminary Unpaid
Transaction Expense Amount shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Indebtedness, the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Unpaid Transaction
Expense Amount, respectively. In the event that the Stakeholder Representative
timely delivers a Dispute Notice to the Company, the Company and the
Stakeholder Representative shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute as promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any
adjustments to the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet and the amounts shown in
the Preliminary Closing Statement shall be made in accordance with the
agreement of the Company and the Stakeholder Representative. If the Company
and the Stakeholder Representative are unable to resolve any such dispute
within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Company and
the Stakeholder Representative shall mutually agree in writing) of the
delivery to the Company of such Dispute Notice, the remaining items in such
dispute shall promptly thereafter be submitted to the Independent Accounting
Firm for resolution, and the resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall consider only those items and amounts as to which the Company and the
Stakeholder Representative have disagreed within the time periods and on the
terms specified above. In making such determination, the Independent
Accounting Firm may rely only upon information submitted to it by the Company
or the Stakeholder Representative. In resolving any disputed item, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to deliver to the Company and the Stakeholder
Representative a written report setting forth the resolution of each disputed
matter within thirty (30) days of submission of the Preliminary Closing
Balance Sheet and the Preliminary Closing Statement to it and, in any case, as
promptly as practicable after such submission. The Independent Accounting Firm
will determine the allocation of the cost of its review and report based on
the inverse of the percentage its determination (before such

 



23  allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. For example, should
the items in dispute total $1,000 and the Independent Accounting Firm awards
$600 in favor of the Stakeholder Representatives position, sixty percent
(60%) of the costs of its review would be borne by the Company and forty
percent (40%) of the costs would be borne by the Stakeholder Representative.
The Stakeholder Representative (on behalf of the Holders) and the Company
shall pay the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm as so
allocated.

 

(d) _Final Determination_. The Final Adjustment Amount shall be calculated
using the final determination of the Net Working Capital (the "Final Net
Working Capital"), the Cash of the Acquired Companies (the "Final Closing
Cash"), the Indebtedness (the "Final Closing Indebtedness"), the Unpaid
Transaction Expenses (the "Final Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount"), the Net
Working Capital Difference (substituting for purposes of the Final Adjustment
Amount, "Final Net Working Capital" for "Net Working Capital"), which amount
may not exceed the Adjustment Cap Amount (the "Final Net Working Capital
Difference"), and the Final Adjusted Closing Cash Consideration calculated
from the foregoing, in each case as of the Purchase Price Measurement Time,
whether because no Dispute Notice is timely delivered by the Stakeholder
Representative or because any disputes are resolved as provided above in
_Section 2.7(c)_. No item shall be included or otherwise provided for in more
than one of the Final Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash, Final Closing
Indebtedness or Final Unpaid Transaction Expense Amount.

(i) If the Final Adjustment Amount is negative, then the Stakeholder
Representative shall, within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination thereof, pay the absolute value of the Final Adjustment Amount
(up to the Adjustment Cap Amount) out of the Stockholder Reserve Account to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Parent; which such payment unless otherwise agreed by the
Stakeholder Representative shall be satisfied solely out of Stockholder
Reserve Account and in no event unless otherwise agreed by the Stakeholder
Representative will the Stakeholder Representative, holders of Common Stock
and Company Options be required to make any payment in excess of the
Adjustment Cap Amount or from a source other than the Stockholder Reserve
Account.

(ii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is positive, then Parent shall, within
five (5) Business Days after the final determination thereof, pay or cause to
be paid the Final Adjustment Amount (up to the Adjustment Cap Amount) for the
benefit of the Holders as follows: (A) to the Paying Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Stakeholder
Representative, for distribution to each Holder of Common Stock, an amount
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder as of the
Purchase Price Measurement Time _times_ the Adjusted Share Distribution
Amount and (B) to the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries for
distribution through its payroll system to each Holder of a Vested Company
Option that is an In-the-Money Company Option at the time of
such Distribution, with respect to each such In-the-Money Company Option, an
amount equal to the Adjusted Option Distribution Amount relating to such
Distribution (less any applicable withholding Taxes).

 



24 (iii) If the Final Adjustment Amount is zero, then no payments shall be
made with respect thereto.

(iv) All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _2.7_ shall be
made without deduction, set-off, counterclaim or, other than with respect to
payments in respect of Company Options as set forth in _Section 2.3(c)_ or
pursuant to _Section 6.10(b)_ , withholding. Any payments made to or by the
Stockholders or holders of Company Options pursuant to this _Section 2.7_
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration and Option
Payments.

 

Section 2.8 _Withholding_. __

 

Each Party shall be entitled to deduct from any payment made hereunder any
amounts if and to the extent that any such amounts are required to be
withheld and deducted under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted shall be
remitted by the withholding Party to the appropriate Governmental Entity and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Party in respect of which such deduction was made.

constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Acquired Company party

general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in
equity) and the discretion of a court before which any proceeding therefor may
be brought, (ii) no Acquired Company is or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
is alleged in writing to be in breach of or default in any material respect

domain proceedings of any kind pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against any parcel of Real Property.

not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or for such non-compliance as would
not be required to be remedied by any Acquired Company under any Real
Property Law or under Company Lease. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of

violation of any Real Property Law and there is no basis for the issuance of
any such notice or the taking of any action for such violation.

its authorized representatives during normal business hours reasonable access
to all books, records and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to furnish Parent with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
business and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from
time to time reasonably request. All of such information shall be treated
as "Evaluation Materials" pursuant to the terms of, and as such term is
defined in, the Confidentiality Agreement. At or as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing, the Company will deliver a copy of all
documents in the Data Room to Parent on compact disc, DVD or USB flash drive.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no such access between
the date hereof and the Closing Date shall be permitted to the extent that it
would require any Acquired Company to disclose information subject to
attorney-client or similar privilege (if such disclosure would waive such
privilege) or of which such access is restricted by contract or applicable
Law, (ii) except for contact made in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices and unrelated to any of the
Transaction Agreements or any transactions contemplated thereby, neither
Parent nor its representatives shall contact any suppliers to, or customers
of, the Company regarding the Company prior to the Closing without first
obtaining the written consent of the Company, (iii) no such access shall be
permitted for any environmental testing, sampling or other invasive
environmental investigations and (iv) no such access shall be permitted to
the extent that it would require any Acquired Company to disclose information
that is classified or for which

 



54  disclosure is prohibited by the terms of any contract or Law. The Company
may, as it deems advisable and necessary, designate any sensitive materials
provided to Parent and its authorized representatives under this _Section
6.4(a)_ as "outside counsel only" to the extent competitively sensitive with
Parent. Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of Parent and its representatives and will not be
disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
Parent without the advance written consent of the Company.

claims made against or incurred by the Holders, the Company or any of their
respective affiliates or for any other purpose, for the five (5)-year period
commencing on the Closing Date, the Company (or its successor) will provide
the Stakeholder Representative and its authorized representatives
access (including the right to make photocopies) to all books and records of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their successors) and other written
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their
successors) as the Stakeholder Representative may from time to time request.
The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to preserve and keep all
material books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to the
period prior to the Closing for a period of at least five (5) years from the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) no such
access shall be permitted to the extent that it would require any Acquired
Company to disclose information that is classified, subject to attorney-
client or similar privilege (if such disclosure would waive such privilege) or
for which disclosure is prohibited by the terms of any Contract or Law. The
obligations of the Company under this  _Section_ _ _ _6.4(b)_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Holder
without the express written consent of such affected Holder (it being
expressly agreed that the Holders shall be third-party beneficiaries of this
_Section_ _ _ _6.4(b)_ ). The Company may, as it deems advisable and
necessary, designate any sensitive materials provided to the Stakeholder
Representative and its authorized representatives under this _Section 6.4(b)_
as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained
therein shall be given only to outside counsel of the Stakeholder
Representative and its representatives and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the Stakeholder
Representative without the advance written consent of the Company.

 

Section 6.5 _Filings and Authorizations, Including HSR Act Filing._

 

(a) Each Party shall or shall cause its ultimate parent entity as that term is
defined in the HSR Act to (i) make the filings required of it or any of its
Affiliates under the HSR Act in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, as soon as practicable, but in any event no
later than ten (10) Business Days following the date hereof, (ii) comply at
the earliest practicable date and after consultation with the Company or
Parent, as applicable, with any reasonable request for additional information
or documentary material received by the other or any of its Affiliates from
any applicable Governmental Entity in connection with filings required under
the HSR Act, (iii) cooperate with one another (including furnishing all
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request) in
connection with any filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving
any investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement initiated by any Governmental Entity, (iv) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to secure the early termination of any waiting periods
under the HSR Act to permit the consummation of the transactions

 



55  contemplated hereby at the earliest possible date, and (v) not take, or
cause to be taken, any actions or do, or cause to be done, any things that
would be reasonably expected to materially delay the obtaining of any
approval or to extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable merger control Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby or to cause any Governmental Entity to object to such transactions.
Each Party shall promptly inform the other Parties of any material
communication (whether oral or written) made to, or received by, such Party
from any Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and promptly provide a copy of any such written communication, or a
written summary of any such oral communication, to the other Parties. Each of
the Company and Parent agrees not to initiate or agree to participate in any
substantive meeting, telephone call, or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults
with the other Parties in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other Parties the opportunity to participate.
Parent and the Company shall each be responsible for one-half (1/2) of all
filing fees in connection with filings required under the HSR Act.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Parents undertaking pursuant to this
_Section_ _ _ _6.5_ , Parent agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under the HSR Act that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other party so as to enable
the Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby at the
earliest possible date, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, trusts or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its assets, properties or
businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to be acquired by it
pursuant to this Agreement, as are required to be divested in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order in any suit or
proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of delaying or preventing
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to propose,
negotiate, commit to or effect any divesture, disposition, sale or licenses
of any of its, its Subsidiaries or the Acquired Companies assets or
businesses or to take or agree to take any action involving divestures,
dispositions, licensing, or hold separate arrangements or limitations to its
freedom of action or that of any Acquired Company that would be reasonably
expected to (i) give rise to a material adverse effect on the business of (A)
the Parent, (B) the Acquired Companies taken as whole, or (C) the combined
businesses of Parent and Acquired Companies taken as a whole after the
Closing, or (ii) involve a material amount or portion of the assets or
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (collectively, a "Parent
Adverse Consequences"). In addition, Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits (including the
taking and defending of appeals related thereto) any claim asserted in court
by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated,
any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
consummation of the Closing. The entry by any Governmental Entity in any legal
proceeding of an order permitting the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby but which is subject to certain conditions or that
requires Parent or any of its Affiliates to take any action, including any
restructuring of the assets or lines of business of the Acquired Companies or
lines of business of Parent or any of its Affiliates or any changes to the
existing business of Parent or any of its Affiliates, shall not be deemed a
failure to satisfy the conditions specified in _Section_ _ _ _7.1(a)(ii)_ or 
_7.1(c)_ unless such conditions amount collectively to a Parent Adverse
Consequences. References in this _Section 6.5_ to "Parent" and "Party" shall
also be deemed to refer to the Guarantor as the ultimate parent entity of
Parent, where relevant.

 



56 (c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations,
memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of
any Party before any Governmental Entity or the staff or regulators of any
Governmental Entity, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be disclosed to the other Parties in advance of any filing, submission
or attendance, it being the intent that the Parties will consult and cooperate
with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals.
Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 6.5(c)_ , no Party will be
obligated to share with the other Party any documents that it produces with
its HSR notification that are or could be responsive to Item 4(c) or Item
4(d) of the HSR notification. Each Party shall give sufficient notice to the
other Parties with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact
with any Governmental Entity or the staff or regulators of any Governmental
Entity in order to provide the other Parties with the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact if
acceptable to the Governmental Entity. The Parties may, as they deem
advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive materials
provided to the other under this _Section 6.5_ as "outside counsel only." Such

outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the
advance written consent of the Party providing such materials. Nothing in
this  _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ shall require either party to provide the other
party with access to, or disclose any information to, the other party if such
access or disclosure, in the good faith reasonable belief of the producing
party, (x) would cause significant competitive harm to the producing party if
the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, (y) would waive any
legal privilege of the producing party or (z) would be in violation of
applicable Laws of any Governmental Entity (including the HSR Act) or the
provisions of any agreement to which any producing party is a party.

Letter (an "Indemnity Agreement"), shall survive the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and continue in full force and
effect on equal or more favorable terms and be honored by Parent and the
Acquired Companies after the Closing. Without the prior written consent of
such Company Indemnitee, Parent shall not, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies not to, settle any matter for which it or they are providing
indemnification to any Company Indemnitee, other than any settlement
exclusively requiring the payment of monetary damages to be paid entirely by

obtaining, at Parents sole expense, a "tail" policy (the "Tail Policy") from
an insurer with a Standard and Poors rating of at least A under the Current
Policies, which (i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Closing
Date, (ii) covers each Person currently covered by the Current Policies for
actions and omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing and (iii) contains

otherwise alter the terms thereunder unless such amendment, repeal or
modification is required by applicable Law. From and after the Closing, the
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, timely submit any and
all claims that may be covered by the Tail Policy.

Action (whether arising before, at or after the Closing) is made against any
Person covered by the Tail Policy or claim for indemnification is made by a
Company Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing, the
provisions of this  _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ shall continue in effect until the
final disposition of such Action or claim.

any of their respective successors or assigns transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper provision
shall be made so that the successor, assign or acquirer of the Company or

written consent of such affected Company Indemnitee (it being expressly
agreed that the Company Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ _ _ _6.6_ ).

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide Parent, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of each
calendar month, with an unaudited balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as

cash flow for the period then ended. From and after the date hereof until the
Closing Date, as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of

extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (B) the Company to prepare or deliver any
financial statements not previously provided to Parent other than unaudited
financial statements of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries for the
three (3)- and six (6)-month periods ended March 29, 2015 and March 27, 2016
and as of March 27, 2016, and June 28, 2015 and June 26, 2016 and as of June

or cause the delivery of any legal opinions or any certificate as to solvency.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to bear any out-of-pocket
cost or expense, pay any fee or incur any Liability or make any commitment or
agreement effective in connection with the Financing. Parent shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Acquired Companies against, and promptly advance
to the Company cash in the amount of, any Liabilities (except for Liabilities
arising as a result of any breach of any Contractual Representations), fees,
costs and expenses that are incurred by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with their compliance with this _Section_ _ _
_6.8_.

 



59 Section 6.9 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._

 

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, and without limiting the obligations of
the Parties under _Section_ _ _ _6.5_ , each of the Parties agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, to
do or cause to be done and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in
doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including: (a)
the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
Parties hereto; (b) the obtaining or filing, as the case may be, of applicable
consents, waivers or approvals of or notices to, any third parties (other than
Governmental Entities, which are governed by _Section 6.5_ ), including those
required in order for an Acquired Company to maintain any Permit after the
Closing; (c) subject to _Section 6.5_ , the defending of any Actions, whether

otherwise pay any consideration to any third party to obtain any applicable
consent, waiver or approval or incur any Liability or make any commitment or
agreement effective in connection with the Financing.

 

Section 6.10 _Tax Matters._

 

(a) If any Transfer Taxes are incurred by any Acquired Company in connection
with the consummation of the Merger, such Transfer Taxes (including any costs
or expenses related thereto) shall be paid by Parent. Any Tax Returns related
to such Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed (or caused to be prepared
and filed) by Parent.

 

(b) On or before the Closing, the Company shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Parent a certificate prepared in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) of the Code certifying that the
Company has not been a United States real property holding corporation within
the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period
specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code; _provided_ , that in the
event the Company does not so deliver (or cause to be delivered) such
certificate, Parents sole recourse under this Agreement (or otherwise) will
be to make the withholdings required under Section 1445 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

(c) Before the Closing, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) obtain, with respect to each Person who is a "disqualified

his or her right to receive or retain any payments of money or other property,
acceleration of benefits, or provision of other rights that have been or will
be made hereunder, under any agreement contemplated herein, or under
any Company Plans, in each case, that are "contingent" (within the meaning of
Code Section 280G) on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that would otherwise result in the imposition of an excise
tax under Section 4999 of the Code on such Person and (ii) submit any such
waived payments and benefits for approval by the Stockholders in a manner that

 



60  complies with the requirements under Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and
Treasury Regulations § 1.280G-1. The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to review and provide comments on all 280G related materials,
including all waivers and stockholder approval materials in advance of the
delivery of such materials to the Stockholders, and the Company shall consider
Parents comments thereon in good faith. This  _Section 6.10(c)_ shall not be
construed to require any specific outcome of the vote described herein and the
failure to obtain any waiver referred to in _Section 6.10(c)(i)_ shall not be
construed as a failure of any condition to Closing. 

(d) Each Acquired Company shall timely prepare (or cause to be prepared) and
timely file (or cause to be filed) all Tax Returns for Tax periods ending
before the Closing Date that are required to be filed on or before the Closing
Date and shall timely pay (or cause to be paid) to the relevant Governmental
Entity all Taxes shown as due on all such Tax Returns. Each such Tax
Return shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice unless
otherwise required by applicable Law. Prior to the filing of any such Tax
Return relating to Taxes applicable to income of the Acquired Companies, the
Company shall deliver to Parent, for its review and approval, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, such Tax Returns a
reasonable period of time (such reasonable period of time to be not less than
thirty (30) days prior to the applicable filing deadline (taking into account
applicable extensions), together with such other information as may reasonably
be requested by Parent to facilitate its review of such Tax Return.

 

(e) None of the Acquired Companies shall amend any material Tax Returns
outside of the ordinary course of business with respect to any Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed. The Acquired Companies shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide to Parent such information as is reasonably requested by Parent in
order to enable Parent to exercise its rights hereunder in an informed manner.

further information, (b) execute and deliver to each other such other
documents and (c) do such other acts and things, all as the other Parties may
reasonably request for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this
Agreement and the Transaction Agreements to which they are a party and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
either: (A) maintain or increase (but not reduce) the employee

the Contingent Litigation Proceeding a revised engagement letter providing
that if the Closing occurs (i) the Stakeholder Representative shall be solely
responsible for all fees and expenses incurred by the Acquired Companies
in connection with the Contingent Litigation Proceeding, (ii) all related
invoices will be sent directly to the Stakeholder Representative and (iii) the
payment of such invoices shall be the sole responsibility of the Stakeholder
Representative (the "Current Revised Engagement Letter"). If the Stakeholder
Representative engages any legal counsel in connection with the Contingent
Litigation Proceeding other than the Acquired Companies current legal counsel
as of the date of this Agreement, the Stakeholder Representative shall take
all actions necessary to enter into a written agreement with such legal
counsel providing for similar terms and conditions regarding payment and

Company (other than ministerial obligations of the Acquired Companies with
respect to such settlement or compromise).

 



64 (e) The Stakeholder Representative shall reimburse Parent or any of the

voting or dividend rights in the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries
in connection with the right to receive any portion of the Contingent
Litigation Proceeds. Contingent Litigation Proceeds shall not accrue interest
in any event. The right to receive any portion of the Contingent Litigation
Proceeds shall not constitute any equity or ownership interest in the Company

(h) The right to receive any portion of the Contingent Litigation Proceeds
shall not be evidenced by a certificate or any other instrument.

out-of-pocket cost or expense, pay any fee or incur any Liability or make
any commitment or agreement effective in connection with obtaining the RWI
Policy; (b) none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any Acquired Company or any of
their respective Affiliates shall obtain an insurance policy that permits the
insurer to seek to or enforce any subrogation rights it might have against
any of the Holders as a result of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby other than (to the extent such rights exist under
applicable Law) in the event of fraud; (c) the obtaining of the RWI Policy is
not a condition to the Closing and Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall remain
obligated, subject

 



65  only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII, to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement even if the RWI Policy is not obtained at or prior to the Closing;

date of this Agreement (the "Outside Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section_ _ _ _9.1(b)_ shall

obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have
resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such date;
_provided_ , _further_ , that if any condition set forth in _Section_ _ _
_7.1(a)_ has not been satisfied as of the Outside Date, the Company may, in
its sole discretion, extend the Outside Date on one or more occasions for an

court of competent jurisdiction or other competent Governmental Entity shall
have issued an Order or taken any other Action permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Order or other Action shall have become final and non-
appealable, unless the failure to consummate the Closing because of such

Merger Subsidiary, if Parent is seeking to terminate this Agreement, or
of the Company, if the Company is seeking to terminate this Agreement, to
have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement;

(e) by written notice of the Company to Parent if (x) Parent or Merger

breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ that the

satisfied and, in the case of (x) or (y), such breach is incapable of being
cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ that Parent may not terminate pursuant
to this _Section_ _ _ _9.1(f)_ if the Companys breach has been primarily
caused by a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Parent.

69 ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.1 _Assignment; Binding Effect._

This Agreement and the rights hereunder are not assignable unless (a) such
assignment is consented to in writing by Parent, the Company and the
Stakeholder Representative, or (b) Parent assigns its rights, in whole or in
part, to one or more Affiliates of Parent and provides written notice of same
to the Company, but in the case of clause (b) above, no such assignment will
relieve the Company or Parent of their respective obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may without such consent and
upon written notice to the Company assign its rights hereunder or under any
instrument executed or delivered in connection herewith as collateral security
to any lender or any other debt financing source providing financing in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, which assignment shall
not relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement and all the
provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 10.2 _Release._

 

This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claim or cause of action
based upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby may only be brought against, the Persons that are
signatories as parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Person. For the avoidance of
doubt, except to the extent a signatory party to this Agreement (and then
only to the extent of the specific obligations undertaken by such signatory
party herein and not otherwise), and except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement or any Transaction Agreement, Parent and the Company agree and
acknowledge that no recourse under this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or
agreement, covenant or any other documents or instruments delivered in
connection with this Agreement or other obligation or liabilities of any one
or more of the Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the Stakeholder
Representative under this Agreement) or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be had against any Related Persons of the Company, any Holder or any
Affiliate or assignee thereof, as such, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law, it being expressly agreed and
acknowledged that, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any
Transaction Agreement, no personal liability whatsoever shall attach to, be
imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Related Persons of the Company,
any Holder, any Affiliate or the Stakeholder Representative or assignee
thereof, as such, for any obligation under this Agreement, or pursuant to any
documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation. Each party hereto waives and releases all such liabilities, claims
and obligations against any such Related Persons. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Party or Holder shall be relieved of any Liability for Fraud by
such Person. This _Section_ _ _ _10.2_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect any beneficiary of this  _Section_ _ _
_10.2_ without the express written consent of such affected beneficiary (it
being expressly agreed that the Related Persons of this _Section_ _ _ _10.2_
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section_ _ _ _10.2_ ).

AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY (I) ACCEPT GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THESE COURTS; (II) WAIVE ANY
OBJECTIONS WHICH SUCH PARTY MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING OF VENUE
OF ANY OF THE AFORESAID ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT BROUGHT IN THE COURTS REFERRED TO IN CLAUSE (I) ABOVE AND
HEREBY FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH
COURT THAT SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN
BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM; (III) AGREE THAT SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN
ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT MAY BE MADE BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED
MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, TO SUCH PARTY AT THEIR RESPECTIVE ADDRESSES
PROVIDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH _SECTION 10.5_; AND (IV) AGREE THAT SERVICE AS
PROVIDED IN CLAUSE (III) ABOVE IS SUFFICIENT TO CONFER PERSONAL JURISDICTION
OVER SUCH PARTY IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT, AND OTHERWISE
CONSTITUTES EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT. THE
PARTIES UNCONDITIONALLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN

Section 10.6 _Headings._

 

The headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not be considered in interpreting or construing any of the provisions
contained in this Agreement.

Section 10.7 _Fees and Expenses._

 

Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, each Party hereto shall bear
its own costs and expenses (including investment advisory and legal fees and
expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, it being agreed that Transaction Expenses may
be paid by the Company prior to the Closing or after the Closing so long as
any Transaction Expenses that are not paid prior to the Closing are taken
into account in computing Unpaid Transaction Expenses.

Section 10.8 _Entire Agreement._

This Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto and the Company Disclosure
Letter) and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement
between the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matters hereof and
thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings between the
Parties with respect to such subject matters;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements shall not supersede the
terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive and
remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in accordance with
its terms and this Agreement.

Section 10.9 _Interpretation._

 

(a) When a reference is made to an Article or Section, such reference shall be
to an Article or Section of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

 



73 (b) Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation."

(c) Unless the context requires otherwise, words using the singular or plural
number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, and the use
of any gender herein shall be deemed to include the other genders.

 

(d) References to "dollars" or "$" are to U.S. dollars.

 

(e) The terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby," "hereto" and derivative or similar
words refer to this entire Agreement.

(f) This Agreement was prepared jointly by the Parties hereto and no rule that
it be construed against the drafter will have any application in its
construction or interpretation.

(g) References to documents or other materials "provided" or "made available"
to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or similar phrases shall mean that such
documents or other materials were delivered to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or
their respective representatives or were present in the online data room (the
"Data Room") maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 10.10 _Disclosure._

 

The inclusion of information in any Section of the Company Disclosure Letter
shall not be construed as an admission that such information is material or
that such matter actually constitutes noncompliance with, or a violation of,
any Law, Permit or Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is
applicable. The disclosure of any matter in one section of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed with respect to any other section
of the Company Disclosure Letter, notwithstanding the omission of a cross
reference thereto, to the extent the relevance of such matter to such section
is reasonably apparent. The Company Disclosure Letter is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the specific provisions of this Agreement and nothing
contained therein constitutes a representation, warranty or covenant of any
Party, except as and to the extent provided in the Agreement.

Section 10.11 _Waiver and Amendment._

 

This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by a written
mutual agreement executed and delivered by the Company, Parent and the
Stakeholder Representative; provided, however, that after the Company
Stockholder Consent is executed and delivered by the CSC Stockholders, there
shall be no amendment or waiver that, pursuant to applicable law, requires
further approval of the CSC Stockholders, without the receipt of such further
approvals. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any failure of any
Party to comply with any obligation, covenant, agreement or condition herein
may be waived by the Party entitled to the benefits thereof only by a written
instrument signed by the Party granting such waiver, but such waiver or
failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligations, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 



74 Section 10.12 _Third-Party Beneficiaries._

 

This Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto and their
permitted assigns and, except for _Sections 6.4(b)_ , _6.6_  and _6.19_ ,
_Article VIII_ and _Sections 10.2_ and _10.19_ , nothing herein express or
implied shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
Parties and such permitted assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder.

Section 10.13 _Enforcement._

 

Each of the Company, on one hand, and Parent and Merger Subsidiary, on the
other hand, acknowledges that the rights of each Party to consummate the
Merger are unique and recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of
this Agreement by any Party, money damages will be inadequate and the non-
breaching Party will have no adequate remedy at Law. Accordingly, the
Parties agree that such non-breaching Party shall have the right to obtain,
in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor at Law or
in equity, specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable relief
(without posting of bond or other security) to enforce their rights and the
other Parties obligations hereunder. In the event that any Action should be
brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, no Party
will allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense, that there is an
adequate remedy under applicable Law. Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge
that, prior to the Closing or the earlier valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1_ , the Company will have the right to specifically
enforce the obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
Merger on the terms and pursuant to the conditions of this Agreement. Except
as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies of the parties to this
Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither any failure nor any
delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this
Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. If any Action for the
enforcement of this Agreement is brought with respect to or because of an
alleged dispute, breach, default or misrepresentation in connection with any
of the provisions hereof, the successful or prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover reasonable attorneys fees and other costs incurred in that
Action, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

Section 10.14 _Severability._

 

If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any such provision to
any Person or circumstance shall be held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof.

 

Section 10.15 _Counterparts; Signatures._

 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which
when executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together
shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument binding upon all of the
Parties notwithstanding the fact that all Parties are not signatory to the
original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, e-mail,
facsimile or other electronic signatures shall be deemed originals, and the
Parties agree to exchange original signatures as promptly as possible.

 



75 Section 10.16 _No Right of Setoff._

 

No Party hereto nor any Affiliate thereof may deduct from, set off, holdback
or otherwise reduce in any manner whatsoever any amount owed to it hereunder
against any amounts owed hereunder by such Persons to the other Parties or any
of such other Parties Affiliates.

 

Section 10.17 _Time is of the Essence._

 

Time is of the essence for each and every provision of this Agreement.
Whenever the last day for the exercise of any privilege or the discharge or
any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day which is not a Business Day, the
Party having such privilege or duty may exercise such privilege or discharge
such duty on the next succeeding day which is a Business Day.

 

Section 10.18 _Stakeholder Representative._ __

 

(a) The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the
Stockholders of Common Stock shall constitute the grant to the Stakeholder
Representative of the full power and authority to act as agent and attorney-
in-fact, with full power of substitution to act in the name, place and of each
Represented Partys stead with respect to the transactions contemplated
by, and all the terms and provisions of, this Agreement and to act on such
Represented Partys behalf in any dispute, litigation or arbitration involving
this Agreement and to do or refrain from doing all such further acts and
things, and execute all such agreements, certificates, instruments or other
documents, as the Stakeholder Representative shall deem necessary or
appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the power to (i) interpret the terms and provisions of
this Agreement and the documents to be executed and delivered in connection
herewith, (ii) execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements,
certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions,
waivers, undertakings, amendments and other documents required or permitted
to be given in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) receive service of process in connection
with any claims under this Agreement, (iv) agree to negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, assume the defense of claims, demand
arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with
respect to such claims and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the sole judgment of the Stakeholder Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing, (v) conduct, control, prosecute and settle the Contingent
Litigation Proceeding, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in
the sole judgment of the Stakeholder Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing, (vi) give and receive notices and communications, (vii)
authorize delivery to Parent of funds from the Stockholder Reserve Account or
any portion thereof in satisfaction of any claims brought by Parent, (viii)
receive and distribute the consideration payable hereunder, including payments
from the Stockholder Reserve Account and any earnings and proceeds thereon,
(ix) pay expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby out of the Stockholder Reserve Account, (x) holdback from the
consideration payable hereunder any amounts necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stakeholder Representative, including any expenses to be paid

 



76  to the Stakeholder Representative by the Stockholders and (xi) take all
actions (or refrain from taking actions) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Stakeholder Representative as agent for and on behalf of the
Represented Parties in connection with this Agreement.

(b) The appointment of the Stakeholder Representative shall be deemed coupled
with an interest and is hereby irrevocable. The provisions of this _Section_ _
_ _10.18_ are independent and severable, shall constitute an irrevocable power
of attorney, coupled with an interest and surviving death or dissolutions,
granted by the Represented Parties to the Stakeholder Representative, and
shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives, successors
and assigns of each such Represented Party.

 

(c) From time to time when the Stakeholder Representative determines, in the
sole judgment of the Stakeholder Representative, that it is holding on behalf
of the Holders (through the Stockholder Reserve Account) amounts in excess of
that needed to cover the Stakeholder Representative for any Damage, fees,
costs or expenses arising (or that may arise) from the performance of
the duties of the Stakeholder Representative hereunder, the Stakeholder
Representative shall distribute to each Holder such Holders Adjusted Share
Distribution Amount or Adjusted Option Distribution Amount, as the case may
be, of such excess amounts.

(d) The Stakeholder Representative shall act for the Represented Parties on
all of the matters set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Stakeholder
Representative reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the
Represented Parties and consistent with their obligations under this
Agreement, and shall not waive, amend or otherwise modify this Agreement,
waive any condition contained herein, enter into or execute any agreement,
certificate, instrument or other document, or do or refrain from doing any
other act or deed, that has the effect of adversely and disproportionately
impacting any Represented Party relative to the other Represented Parties in
a manner that is inconsistent with the relative rights of such
disproportionately impacted Represented Party under this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of such Represented Party. The Stakeholder
Representative shall not be responsible to the Represented Parties for any
Damages they may suffer by reason of the performance by the Stakeholder
Representative of the duties of the Stakeholder Representative under this
Agreement, other than Damage arising from a willful and knowing violation of
the Law or this Agreement by the Stakeholder Representative.

(e) Each Represented Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Stakeholder Representative from, and promptly reimburse the Stakeholder
Representative for, any Damages arising from the performance of the duties of
the Stakeholder Representative hereunder, including the cost of any legal
counsel or accountants retained by the Stakeholder Representative on behalf of
the Represented Parties or otherwise, but excluding any Damages arising from a
willful and knowing violation of the Law or this Agreement by the Stakeholder
Representative.

(f) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Stakeholder Representative
taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the Stakeholder
Representative pursuant to this _Section_ _ _ _10.18_ shall be conclusive and
binding upon each Represented Party, and no Represented Party shall have the
right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same.

 



77 (g) Parent and the Company shall be entitled to rely exclusively upon the
communications of the Stakeholder Representative relating to the foregoing as
the communications of the Represented Parties. Neither Parent nor the Company
(x) need be concerned with the authority of the Stakeholder Representative to
act as agent for and on behalf of all Represented Parties hereunder or (y)
shall be held liable or accountable in any manner for any act or omission of
the Stakeholder Representative in such capacity.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ _ _ _10.18_ ,
the provisions of this  _Section_ _ _ _10.18_ do not affect any right of
Parent hereunder or create any obligation on the part of Parent. The
Represented Parties shall bear full responsibility for any and all obligations
arising pursuant to this  _Section_ _ _ _10.18_.

Section 10.19 _Conflict Waiver._ __

 

Each of Dechert LLP and Perkins Coie LLP has represented the Company and
certain Stockholders. All parties to this Agreement recognize the commonality
of interest that exists and will continue to exist between the Company and the
Stockholders until Closing, and the parties agree that such commonality of
interest should continue to be recognized after the Closing. Specifically,
Parent and the Company hereby agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of
their Subsidiaries, directors, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns (the "Waiving Parties"),
that (a) it shall not, and shall not cause the Company to, seek to have
Dechert LLP or Perkins Coie LLP disqualified from representing any Stockholder
or any Stockholders Affiliate (the "Stockholder Group") in connection with
any Action that may arise between the Stockholder Group and Parent or the
Company primarily in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution
and delivery of the Transaction Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, and (b) in connection with any such
Action, any member of the Stockholder Group involved in such Action (and not
Parent or the Company) will have the right to decide whether or not to waive
the attorney-client privilege that may apply to any communications between
the Company and Dechert LLP and/or Perkins Coie LLP that occurred prior to the
Closing. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company, for itself and the
Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that
all communications between the Stockholder Group and their counsel, including
Dechert LLP and Perkins Coie LLP, made primarily in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, the
Transaction Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby shall be
deemed privileged communications between the Stockholder Group and such
counsel, and such privilege shall survive the Closing and shall remain in
effect, provided that any such privilege, from and after the Closing, shall
belong to the Stockholder Group (excluding the Acquired Companies) and shall
not pass to or be claimed by the Company or any of its Affiliates, and none of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company or any of the Waiving Parties or
any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through any of them, will seek
to obtain the same by any process. Parent and the Company acknowledge that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not Dechert LLP or Perkins Coie LLP
provides legal services to the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date. The
Parties understand and specifically agree that Dechert LLP and Perkins Coie
LLP may

 



78  withdraw from representing the Acquired Companies and continue to represent
the Stockholder Group (subject to applicable Law and ethical obligations and
requirements), even if the interests of the Stockholder Group, and the
interests of the Acquired Companies are or may be adverse, including in
connection with any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, and even though Dechert LLP and Perkins
Coie LLP may have represented the Acquired Companies in a matter substantially
related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for the Acquired
Companies, and Parent hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of
interest arising therefrom. Each of Dechert LLP and Perkins Coie LLP shall be
an express third-party beneficiary of this _Section 10.19_.
