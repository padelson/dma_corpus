year ended December&nbsp;31, 1998, ALL was organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) under the Code, and its actual and proposed method of operation up to and including the

enabled it and will enable it to satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT up to and including the Acceptance Time. We express no opinion with respect to any taxable year of ALL ended prior to 1998. ALL&#146;s qualification and taxation
as a REIT depend upon its ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, certain requirements, including requirements with respect to the source of its income, the composition of its assets, distribution levels and diversity of stock
ownership, and various other requirements imposed under the Code, the results of which are not reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results of ALL&#146;s operation for any one taxable year satisfy the requirements
for taxation as a REIT under the Code. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%;padding-bottom:3px;line-height:95%; vertical-align:top"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Although the opinion expressed herein
relates to the satisfaction of the REIT qualification requirements through the Acceptance Time, the REIT qualification requirements (including those relating to a REIT&#146;s gross income, assets, and distributions) are normally tested at the end of

composition of ALL&#146;s stockholders, or the absence of any distribution) occurs or does not occur on or after the Acceptance Time that adversely affects ALL&#146;s qualification as a REIT. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing, the
opinion expressed herein shall not be rendered or be effective if ALL shall fail to meet its (i)&nbsp;distributions (and deduction for dividends paid) requirement under Section&nbsp;857(a) of the Code (which requirement is tested on a taxable year
basis), or (ii)&nbsp;REIT stockholder requirements under Sections 856(a)(5), (a)(6) and (h)&nbsp;of the Code, for any taxable period ending after the Acceptance Time.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT><FONT
