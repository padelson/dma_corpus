Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of a "subsequent offering
period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this Section 1.1(f).

respects with the provisions of all applicable Federal and other securities

Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Each of
Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall correct promptly any information
provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such
information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or
as otherwise required by applicable Law. Parent and Purchaser further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if
applicable), to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of the
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the
Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and

reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Purchaser shall use their
reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Offer Documents. The Company hereby consents to the
inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation, as such
Company Recommendation may be amended and until such Company Recommendation
may be withdrawn, in each case as permitted by this Agreement. If Purchaser
terminates or withdraws the Offer, or this Agreement is terminated prior to
the purchase of Shares in the Offer, Purchaser shall promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all
tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. The Company



 

\- 4 - and the Purchaser shall hire a mutually acceptable information agent in
connection with the Offer.

any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common
Stock), cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
combination or other like change with respect to Common Stock occurring on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time Purchaser accepts for
payment and pays for any Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), if any.

respects with the provisions of all applicable Federal and other securities
Laws. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9
to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case
as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company shall correct promptly any information provided by it for use
in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law. The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Purchaser and
their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Purchaser and

a reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses, and the Company
shall give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions

misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Proxy Statement, as so

and their counsel a reasonable opportunity to review any such written
responses, and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable

Shares as of the most recent practicable date, as well as mailing labels
containing such names and addresses and (ii) all lists of stockholders,
security position lists, computer files and all other information identifying
the beneficial owners of Shares as of the most recent practicable date which

information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon the
Companys written request, promptly deliver to the Company the original and
all copies of such information then in its possession or control.



 

\- 6 - Section 1.3 _Board of Directors_.

(a) Upon the Acceptance Time, and from time to time thereafter as Shares are
acquired by Parent or Purchaser, subject to compliance with the provisions
of the Constituent Documents of the Company, applicable Law and the
applicable rules of the NYSE, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board of
Directors of the Company as is equal to the product of (i) the total number
of directors on the Board of Directors of the Company (after giving effect to
the directors elected or designated by Purchaser pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by (ii) the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser and any of their affiliates bears to
the total number of Shares then outstanding (disregarding any unvested and
unexercisable Company Stock Options and all other unvested rights to acquire
shares of the Company Common Stock). The Company shall, upon any exercise of
such right by Purchaser, take all such actions as are necessary or desirable
to (A) elect or designate to the Board of Directors of the Company
the individuals designated by Purchaser and permitted to be so elected or
designated by the first sentence of this Section 1.3(a), including promptly
filling vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors of
the Company, promptly increasing the size of the Board of Directors of the
Company (including by action of the Board of Directors of the Company and by
the amendment of the by-laws of the Company, if necessary, so as to increase
the size of the Board of Directors of the Company) and/or promptly securing
the resignations of such number of its incumbent directors as are necessary or
desirable to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected or designated to
the Board of Directors of the Company, and (B) cause the Persons designated
by Purchaser to constitute the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the Board of Directors of the Company of the members of (I)
each committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (II) each board of
directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary, and (III) each
committee (or similar body) of each such board of directors (or similar body),
in each case to the full extent permitted by the provisions of
the Constituent Documents of the Company and each such Company Subsidiary,
applicable Law and the applicable NYSE rules. From and after the Acceptance
Time and until the Effective Time, the Company shall take all action necessary
to elect to be treated as a "controlled company" as defined by applicable
NYSE rules and make all necessary filings and disclosures associated with such
status. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take all
actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section
1.3(a), including mailing to stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9)
the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder to enable Purchasers designees to be elected or
designated to the Board of Directors of the Company. Purchaser shall supply
the Company with information with respect to Purchasers designees and
Parents and Purchasers respective officers, directors and affiliates to the
extent required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The provisions of this Section 1.3(a) are in addition
to and shall not limit any rights that any of Purchaser, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares
as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

(b) In the event that Purchasers designees are elected or designated to the
Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to Section 1.3(a), then, subject
to the Constituent Documents of the Company, until the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause the Board of



 

\- 7 - Directors of the Company to maintain at least such number of "independent
directors," as defined by the applicable NYSE rules, as may be required by
the applicable NYSE rules or the federal securities Laws, at least one of whom
shall be an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 401(h) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (any such "independent directors"
as of the date of this Agreement (and their successors as provided below), the
" _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability or
resignation, the Company, Purchaser and Parent shall take all necessary action
(including creating a committee of the Board of Directors of the Company) so
that the entire Board of Directors of the Company shall be entitled to
designate another Person or Persons to fill such vacancy or vacancies, and
such Person or Persons thereafter shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director
for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director then remains, the
other directors shall designate Persons to fill such vacancies and such
Persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if
Purchasers designees constitute a majority of the Board of Directors of the
Company after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, then the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required
(i) to authorize any agreement between the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent, Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates (other than the Company or any Company Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, (ii) for the Company to amend or terminate this Agreement, (iii) to
exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or remedies hereunder,
(iv) to extend the time for performance of Parents or Purchasers obligations
hereunder or (v) to amend the Constituent Documents of the Company.

Section 1.4 _The Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company and the Company Partnership hereby grant to Purchaser an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase that number of
Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of Shares
that, when added to the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their
respective affiliates at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one
Share more than the number of Shares necessary for the Company to be merged
with the Purchaser pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL at a price per Share
equal to the Offer Price (a " _Short Form Merger_ ").

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once at any time after the
Acceptance Time and prior to the earlier to occur of (A) the Effective
Time and (B) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable if (i)
any provision of any applicable Law or any judgment, injunction, order or
decree of any Governmental Entity shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect to such
exercise, (ii) the number of Top-Up Option Shares would exceed the sum of the
number of authorized but unissued Shares and any treasury shares available for
issuance or (iii) after issuance of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option, the
number of shares will be less than the amount required for Purchaser to
effect the Short Form Merger and; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Top-Up
Option shall terminate concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1.



 

\- 8 - (c) In the event Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Purchaser
shall so notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice
(i) the number of Shares owned by Parent, Purchaser and their respective
affiliates immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and
(ii) the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, notify Parent and Purchaser in writing of
the number of Shares then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares.
At the Top-Up Closing, Purchaser shall pay the Company or the Company
Partnership, as the case may be, the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Option Shares by delivery of, at Purchasers option, (A)
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the
Company, (B) immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account
designated by the Company in an amount equal to not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Option Shares and a promissory note, bearing interest
at the USD LIBOR Rate, and due six months after the Top-Up Closing, or (C) any
combination thereof, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a
certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. If the Purchaser exercises
the Top-Up Option, then the parties shall cause the Short Form Merger to be
consummated immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Shares.

(d) Parent and Purchaser acknowledge that the Shares which Purchaser may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the
U.S. securities laws and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and
Purchaser represent and warrant to the Company that Purchaser is, or will be
upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor," as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Purchaser agrees
that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Purchaser for
the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection
with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

Section 1.5 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged
with and into the Purchaser and the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall thereupon cease. The Purchaser shall be the surviving entity in
the Merger (with respect to all post-closing periods, the "
_Surviving Entity_ "). At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving
Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Purchaser
shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Entity.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, upon prior written
notice by the Purchaser to the Company, the direction of the Merger shall be
reversed such that the Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company
and the separate corporate existence of the Purchaser shall thereupon cease
and the Company shall be the surviving entity in the Merger. If the Merger is
reversed pursuant to the preceding sentence, then all references herein
to "Surviving Entity" shall be deemed to refer to the Company rather than the
Purchaser and all references herein to "Merger" shall be deemed to refer to
the Merger as reversed.



 

\- 9 - Section 1.6 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VII, take place at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 203 North
LaSalle Street, Suite 1900, Chicago, Illinois 60601 at 10:00 a.m. Chicago time
on the second Business Day after all of the conditions set forth in Article
VII have been fulfilled or waived (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) in accordance with this Agreement,
or at such other place and time and/or on such other date as the Company and
Parent may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.7  _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a
certificate of merger as contemplated by the DGCL (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ "), together with any required related certificates, with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with, the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of
State on the Closing Date, or at such later time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. As used herein, the "
_Effective Time_ " shall mean the time at which the Merger shall become
effective.

Section 1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Entity (the " _Certificate of Incorporation_ "), until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.9 _By-Laws_. The by-laws of the Company in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of the Surviving Entity (the "
_By-Laws_ ") until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law.

Section 1.10  _Directors_. The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors
of the Surviving Entity until their successors have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and the By-Laws.

Section 1.11  _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers

Section 1.12  _Stockholder s Meeting_.

(a) The Company, acting through (or upon authorization by) the Board of
Directors of the Company, shall, in accordance with and subject to the
requirements of the Companys Constituent Documents and applicable Law and
subject to Section 1.2(b):

(i) (A) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, duly set a record
date for, call and give notice of a special meeting of its stockholders (the "
_Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and taking action upon



 

\- 10 - this Agreement, and (B) as promptly as practicable after the date hereof
convene and hold the Special Meeting;

(ii) cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as possible after the date that the SEC staff advises that it has no
further comments thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the proxy

(iii) use its reasonable best efforts to secure any approval in favor of the
approval and adoption of the Agreement by the stockholders of the Company that
is required by the Companys Constituent Documents and the DGCL and any other
applicable Law to effect the Merger.

(b) The Company shall not postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting except
that, after receiving the written consent of the Parent, the Company shall
adjourn or postpone the Special Meeting to the extent legally necessary to
ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is
provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the
Special Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement)
there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Special Meeting.
After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall prepare and distribute as
promptly as practicable any such required supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement and following any such adjournment or postponement of the Special
Meeting, the Company shall take all action necessary to reconvene the Special
Meeting as promptly as practicable after such adjournment or postponement.

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned by it,
Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates in favor of the approval and
adoption of this Agreement and deliver or provide, in its capacity as a
stockholder of the Company or otherwise, any other approvals that are required
by the DGCL and any other applicable Law to effect the Merger.

Section 1.13 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded
Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive a
cash amount equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), subject to any applicable withholding Taxes.

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares or Dissenting
Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired, and
each certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented (or
upon issuance would represent) any such shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) formerly represented thereby. 



 

\- 11 - (c) Each Excluded Share at the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be
outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

(d) Each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding as a share of Series A
Preferred Stock of the Surviving Entity having the same powers, rights and
preferences and shall otherwise be unaffected by the Merger.

(e) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder thereof, each share of the capital stock of Purchaser
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of the
Surviving Entity and such shares shall constitute the only issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of the Surviving Entity.

Section 1.14  _Treatment of Company Stock Options_.

(a) The Company promptly shall notify each holder of the Company Stock
Options, in writing, of the Transactions in accordance with the Company Stock
Plans (the " _Option Holder Notice_ "). The Option Holder Notice shall (i)
apprise the holders of outstanding Company Stock Options of their ability to
exercise the Options in accordance with the Company Stock Plan prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) disclose that, if not exercised, such Company Stock
Options will terminate at the Effective Time and (iii) disclose that if any
Company Stock Options are not exercised prior to the Effective Time or
terminated as contemplated in clause (ii), the holders of such Company Stock
Options will be entitled to receive the Option Merger Consideration in respect
of such Company Stock Options. As of the Effective Time, each outstanding
Company Stock Option shall be terminated by virtue of the Merger and each
holder of a Company Stock Option shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, other than the right to receive, in respect of each such terminated
Company Stock Option, a single lump sum payment (without interest and subject
to the deduction and withholding of such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law) in cash an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of (i) the Merger Consideration over (ii) the per share
exercise price for such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Merger
Consideration_ "). Payment of the Option Merger Consideration to each of the
holders of Company Stock Options entitled thereto shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement. Any amounts withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the Company Stock Option in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
was made. If the per share exercise price of any such Company Stock Option is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option
shall be canceled with a cash payment of $0.001 per share being made in
respect of each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option, for each Company Stock Option rounded to the next highest full cent.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions required by
the Company Stock Plans under which such Company Stock Options were granted to
cause such Company Stock Plans and all Company Stock Options granted
thereunder to terminate at the Effective  



 

\- 12 -  Time, including adopting any plan amendments and resolutions and obtaining
any required Consents, without paying any consideration or incurring any debts
or obligations on behalf of the Company or the Surviving Entity.

Section 1.15 _OP Units_.

(a) At or prior to commencement of the Offer, the Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, shall either:

(i) direct the Company Partnership (with a written notice to such effect) to
give each holder of units of limited partnership interest of the Company
Partnership (the " _OP Units_ ") an opportunity to redeem their OP Units for
cash in an amount per OP Unit equal to the Offer Price. Such redemption shall
be conditioned on (x) the Purchasers acceptance for payment and payment for
Shares tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or (y) the
effectiveness of the Merger, and such other terms as the Purchaser and each
redeeming holder of OP Units may agree. At or prior to the earlier to
occur of the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time, Purchaser shall loan to
the Company Partnership sufficient funds (as requested by the Company) for the
Company Partnership to satisfy such redemption obligations. Such loan shall be
pursuant to a promissory note that provides for interest at a rate of 5% per
annum, matures in two years, does not require any payments of interest or
principal until maturity and may not be prepaid in whole or in part at any
time; or

(ii) make a tender offer to acquire the outstanding OP Units upon the same
terms and conditions as the Offer. The redemption option in clause (i) above
and the tender offer described in this clause (ii) are herein referred to as
the " _OP Offer_."

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase one OP Unit of
the Company Partnership for a cash purchase price equal to the Offer Price and
Parent shall become a limited partner of the Company Partnership.

Section 1.16 _Escrow of Deposit_. On the date hereof, the Purchaser
has deposited with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Deposit Escrow Agent_ ")
(a) cash in the amount of $5,000,000 and (b) a note payable to the Company
(the " _Deposit Note_ ") in the amount of $5,000,000 due 12 business days
after execution of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Deposit_ ") to be held
in escrow pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement among the parties
hereto and the Deposit Escrow Agent in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_ "). Upon delivery of an additional
$5,000,000 to the Deposit Escrow Agent, the Deposit Note shall be cancelled
and returned to Purchaser. At the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the
Closing, the Deposit Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit, together with all
interest earned thereon, if any, to the paying agent for the Offer or Exchange
Agent, as applicable.

Section 1.17 _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the outstanding Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a



 

\- 13 - different number of shares or different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination or
exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities shall be declared with a record date within such period, or any
similar event shall have occurred, the Offer Price shall be appropriately
adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
Section 1.17 is intended to modify the restrictions and requirements of
Article V of this Agreement or to permit any of the events described in this
Section 1.17 except as permitted by Article V.

Section 1.18 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder (a
" _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who is entitled to demand, and who properly
demands, appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to any Merger Consideration in respect of such Dissenting Shares
unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to seek appraisal of
its Dissenting Shares under the DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any
Person who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have
failed properly to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost the
right to seek appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such Dissenting Shares had been
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.14. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of Dissenting Shares,
offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of
any such demands.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint
a commercial bank or trust company to act as exchange agent hereunder for the
purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, an amount of cash representing the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.13, less (a) any amounts to
be delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.16 and (b) an amount
equal to the Merger Consideration for each Share with respect to which a
Dissenting Stockholder has exercised dissenters rights. If any Person who
otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed properly
to perfect or shall have effectively



 

\- 14 - withdrawn or lost the right to seek appraisal with respect to any Dissenting
Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as though such
Dissenting Shares had been converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 1.13, Purchaser shall promptly deposit an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration for each such Share held by such stockholder. Any cash
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, of a Certificate (i)
a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be
in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to
the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed
and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in
the amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.13 and this Article II. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section
1.13. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check in the proper
amount of any Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.13 may be issued
with respect to such Company Common Stock, as the case may be, to such a
transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock
is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid.

Section 2.3 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II shall be deemed to
have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares.

Section 2.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or otherwise on the
instruction of Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
Parent for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled
pursuant to Section 1.13. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Entity free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the
Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person
in respect of any Merger



 

\- 15 - Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

Section 2.6 _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily
basis; _provided_ that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Article I or this
Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

Section 2.7 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Entity, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such reasonable amount as the Surviving Entity may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

Section 2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Entity and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or any other equity rights in the Company such amounts as it is

budgets for such Company Properties delivered to Parent prior to the date
hereof.

free and clear of all Liens, except such Liens (i) reflected on Section 3.9

Company as of December 31, 2007, and the notes thereto, (ii) which are normal
to the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and are not,
in the aggregate, material in relation to the assets of the Company on a
consolidated basis, or (iii) that would not, individually or in the aggregate,

Section 3.10 _Tax Matters_.

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed. All such Tax Returns are accurate and complete in all
material respects. The Company and each Company Subsidiary have paid all Taxes
shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns. The financial statements
contained in the most recent Company SEC Report reflect an adequate reserve
for all Taxes payable or accrued by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date of such
financial statements.

(b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have complied with all applicable
Laws relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding
of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446, and 3402 of the Code or
similar provisions under any foreign Laws) and have duly and timely withheld
and have paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authorities all amounts
required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof
under all applicable Laws.

(c) No deficiencies for Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing or, to

material and that have not  



 

\- 27 -  been paid or otherwise resolved. No waivers of the time in which to assess
Taxes have been executed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and no

Company or the Company Subsidiaries except for statutory Liens for Taxes not
yet due. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is subject to any
existing examination by any Governmental Entity and no such examination has
been scheduled.

(d) The Company or its predecessor (i) has been subject to taxation as a real
estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of Section 856 of

years, (ii) has operated, and will continue to operate, in such a manner as to
qualify as a REIT until the Acceptance Time and (iii) has not taken or omitted
to take any action which would reasonably be expected to (A) result in any
material amount of rents paid by the tenants of the Properties to be excluded
from the definition of "rents from real property" under Section 856(d)(2)(C)
of the Code, or (B) otherwise result in a challenge to its status as a REIT,
and no such challenge is pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened.
Each Company Subsidiary which is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company (i) has been since its formation and continues to be
treated for federal income tax purposes as either a partnership or
disregarded as a separate entity and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation, as the case may be, and (ii) has not since its
formation owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that
would cause the Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each Company
Subsidiary which is a corporation or treated as an association taxable as a
corporation has been since the date of its formation a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code, a "taxable REIT subsidiary"
within the meaning of Section 856(l)(1), or a REIT. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary holds any asset (x) the disposition of which would be
subject to rules similar to Section 1374 of the Code as a result of an
election under Sections 1.337(d)-5 or 1.337(d)-6 of the Treasury Regulations
or (y) which is subject to a consent filed pursuant to Section 341(f) of the
Code and the regulations thereunder. All former Company Subsidiaries, if such

Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code or Sections
1.337(d)-5 or 1.337(d)-6 of the Treasury Regulations, including any material
Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of
the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred
any liability for Taxes other than (i) in the ordinary course of business, or
(ii) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the sales of
property.

(f) The Company has no earnings and profits attributable to any non-REIT year
within the meaning of Section 857 of the Code.

(g) Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each Tax Protection
Agreement to which the Company or a Company Subsidiary is a party. Copies of
all such agreements have been delivered to Parent. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under a Tax Protection
Agreement.



 

\- 28 - (h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
understanding or arrangement described in Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii) of the
Code or treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) or is a material advisor as
defined in Section 6111(b) of the Code.

(i) The Company has the right to make or to require, and, after the Acceptance
Time will continue to have the right to make or to require, each
Company Subsidiary that is subject to federal income taxation as a
partnership to make an election under Section 754 of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under state or local law) to adjust the basis of its
property as provided in Sections 734(b) and 743(b) of the Code.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its predecessors in interest has breached
any representations, warranties and covenants of, and the Company and its

agreements (the " _REMIC Transfer Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the
Company (or its predecessors) transferred certain REMIC interests, whole
loans, or certificates issued by GNMA, FNMA, or FHLMC to the Structured
Mortgage Trust 1997-1 or any other trust or pool of assets (collectively, the
" _CMBS Pools_ ") and obligations payable from such trust or pool of assets,
including certificates of beneficial interest, notes, bonds, or comparable
instruments were issued, and (ii) those certain agreements (the " _Servicing
Agreements_ ") pursuant to which the Company (or its predecessor) provided
certain mortgage servicing, administrative, and other services to issuers of
REMIC interests, collateralized mortgage obligations, or other notes or
certificates payable from the proceeds of mortgage loans (including
certificates issued by GNMA, FNMA, or FHLMC) or REMIC regular interests. After
the date hereof, the Company has no material liability or obligations under
any such agreements. In connection with any issuance of securities described
in this Section 3.10(j), the Company and its predecessor in interest complied
with all relevant laws. Set forth on Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure
Letter is a list of all CMBS Pools in which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary owns an ownership interest.

benefit, group insurance, profit sharing, deferred compensation, stock option,
stock loan, bonus, incentive, vacation pay, tuition reimbursement, severance
pay, or other employee benefit plan, trust, agreement, contract, arrangement,

1974, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("
_ERISA_ ") (" _Pension Plan_ "), and any welfare plan as defined in Section
3(1) of ERISA (" _Welfare Plan_ ")), whether any of the foregoing is funded,
insured or self-funded, written or oral, (i) sponsored or maintained by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (each a " _Controlled Group Member_ ") and
covering any Controlled Group Members active or former employees (or their
beneficiaries), (ii) to which any Controlled Group Member is a party or by
which any Controlled Group Member (or any of the rights, properties or assets
thereof) is bound or (iii) with respect to  



 

\- 29 -  which any Controlled Group Member has made any payments, contributions or
commitments or may otherwise have any liability (whether or not such
Controlled Group Member still maintains such Employee Plan). Each Pension
Plan, Welfare Plan and any other material Employee Plan is listed on Section
3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(b) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date

Controlled Group Member sponsors, maintains, has established or has any
continuing liability under any Welfare Plan which provides for continuing
benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant
after such participants termination of employment, except as may be required
by Section 4980B of the Code or Section 601 ( _et_ _seq_.) of ERISA, or

requirements of ERISA and any other applicable Law governing such Employee
Plan, and each Employee Plan has at all times been properly administered in
all respects in accordance with all such requirements of law, and in
accordance with its terms and the terms of any applicable collective
bargaining agreement to the extent consistent with all such requirements of
law, except, in each of the foregoing cases, to the extent that any
noncompliance has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Employee Plan which is intended to be
qualified is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS stating that such Employee Plan
meets the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code and that the trust
associated with such Employee Plan is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the
Code (or the Employee Plan is a volume submitter or prototype plan that has an

has occurred which would jeopardize the qualified status of any such Employee
Plan or the tax exempt status of any such trust under Section 401(a) and
Section 501(a) of the Code, respectively. No lawsuits, claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) or complaints to, or by, any person or
governmental entity have been filed or are pending, the Company has received
no written notice of such a lawsuit, claim or complaint and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, there is no fact or contemplated event which would be
expected to give rise to any such lawsuit, claim (other than routine claims
for benefits) or complaint with respect to any Employee Plan, except to the
extent any of the foregoing has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing,
except as disclosed on Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
following are true with respect to each Employee Plan:

(i) except for those not yet required to be filed or distributed, all
Controlled Group Members have filed or caused to be filed every material

reports, as are required under Title I of ERISA, the Code, or both, and no
Controlled Group Member has incurred any material unsatisfied liability in

Code;

Annual Reports (and all schedules and reports relating thereto) and actuarial
reports and (D) all related trust agreements, insurance contracts or other

compliance in all material respects with COBRA and the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and any related regulation or
applicable similar state law.

408 of ERISA.

(e) There has not been any "Reportable Event," as described in Section 4043 of
ERISA, with respect to any Employee Plan (other than such events for which
the thirty (30) day notification period has been waived by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (" _PBGC_ ")) subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(f) No Controlled Group Member has incurred: (i) any liability to the PBGC or
to a trust (for plan terminations instituted prior to December 18, 1987)
described in Section 4049 of ERISA (prior to its repeal), (ii) any
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA ("Multiemployer

withdrawal (within the meaning of Sections 4203 or 4205 of
ERISA, respectively) from, or on behalf of, a Multiemployer Plan, or (iii)
any other liability under Title IV of ERISA.

4069(b), has engaged in a transaction described in ERISA Section 4069\.

ERISA (other than a Multiemployer Plan) equal or exceed the present value of
"Benefit Liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) of each
such Employee Plan as of the last day of the plan year most recently ended
using PBGC termination actuarial assumptions currently in effect or other
actuarial assumptions certified by the Employee Plans actuary as reasonable
for purposes of a standard termination (as described in 4041(b) of ERISA)
with respect to any defined benefit pension plan.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
with respect to each Pension Plan and Welfare Plan maintained by any
Controlled Group Member, such Pension Plan and Welfare Plan, as the case may
be, provides the plan sponsor the authority to amend or terminate such
Pension Plan or Welfare Plan at any time and without liability, subject to
applicable requirements of ERISA and the Code.

(j) No assets of, and no assets managed by, the Company constitute "plan
assets" as defined in 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101, and none of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including those transactions

party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or other labor organization, nor

investment trust duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the State of Maryland and has all requisite power and authority to
own, lease, encumber and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such
proper authority would not, when taken together with all other such failures,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Purchaser is
a Delaware corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. As of the date hereof, all
of the shares of capital stock of Purchaser have been duly authorized, validly
issued and are owned by Parent free and clear of any Liens.

Statutory Approvals, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Purchaser of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by
all necessary action on the part of Parent and Purchaser. This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Purchaser, and
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company
and the Company Partnership, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Parent and Purchaser, enforceable against them in accordance with its terms,
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors rights and general principles of equity.

(b) _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Purchaser does not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby,



 

\- 39 - will not, violate or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both), under, or result
in the termination or modification of, or accelerate the performance required
by, or result in a right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of any
obligation or the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation
of any Violation of Parent or Purchaser pursuant to any provisions of (i) the
Constituent Documents of Parent or Purchaser, (ii) any Law applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets or (iii) any easement or other similar right to use or access real
property, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise,
permit, concession, contract, lease or other instrument, obligation of
agreement of any kind to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any joint
venture of Parent is now a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets may be bound or affected, excluding from the foregoing clauses (ii) and
(iii) such Violations that would not, in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) _Statutory Approvals_. Except as described in the Parent Disclosure
Letter, as provided in this Agreement and the filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State, no declaration, filing or

Governmental Entity is required to be obtained, made or given by or on behalf
of Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of Parent for the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary
of Parent or the consummation by Parent, Purchaser or any other Subsidiary of
Parent of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation,
the Offer and the Merger, the failure of which to obtain, make or give would
have, in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (the " _Parent
Required Statutory Approvals_ ," it being understood that references in this
Agreement to "obtaining" such Parent Required Statutory Approvals shall mean
making such declarations, filings or registrations; giving such notices;
obtaining such authorizations, consents or approvals, and having such waiting
periods expire as are necessary to avoid a violation of Law).

Section 4.3 _Litigation_. There is no claim, suit, action or proceeding
pending, or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any investigation or review pending or threatened, relating to or
affecting Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that could reasonably be expected
to prevent the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 4.4 _Available Funds_. Parent has commitments (the " _Commitments_ ")
pursuant to which certain persons (the " _Investors_ ") have committed to
provide Parent with an amount of capital in excess of the amount required to
purchase Shares pursuant to the Offer, and to pay the Merger Consideration and
the Option Merger Consideration. The Commitments are in full force and effect
and there are no conditions precedent to the respective obligations of the
Investors under the Commitments that would materially and adversely affect the
obligations of the Investors under the Commitments.

entitled to any brokers, finders or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on

to this Agreement will not adversely affect the Companys compliance with the
stock ownership requirements applicable to REITs as contained in Sections
856(a)(5), (a)(6) and (h) of the Code.

\- 46 - Section 6.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company
Subsidiary or any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly
or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly cause, facilitate or knowingly

Proposal or (B) requires Parent or the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Offer, the Merger or any other Transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to, but not after, the
Acceptance Time, the Company may, in response to a _bona fide_ written
Takeover Proposal that was unsolicited and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 6.4(a), and subject to compliance with Section 6.4(c):

(x) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality
agreement containing terms and conditions that, in the aggregate, are not
materially less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement shall not contain
any provisions that would prevent the Company from complying with its
obligation to provide the required disclosure to Parent pursuant to Section
6.4(b), and _provided_ _further_ , that all such information provided to such
Person has previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior
to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; and

(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal;

_provided_ , in each case, that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor, that (i) the failure to furnish such information or
participate in such discussions or negotiations is inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law, and (ii) such Takeover Proposal would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 6.4(f)). The Company
shall (A) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons or their
Representatives conducted prior to the date of this Agreement with respect to
any Takeover Proposal and will request the prompt return or destruction of
any confidential information previously furnished to such Persons in
connection therewith and (B) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to
inform its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.4.

this Section 6.4 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not such person is purporting to act on behalf



 

\- 47 - of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 6.4 by the Company. 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the receipt by the Company of any
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, and in any case within 24 hours
after the receipt thereof, the Company shall provide oral and written notice
to Parent of (i) such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, (ii) the identity of the
Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and (iii) the material
terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any
amendments or modifications thereto). The Company shall keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis of the status of any such Takeover Proposal,
including any changes to the terms and conditions thereof, and promptly
provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence or other
communications and other written materials, and summaries of all oral
correspondence or other communications, sent or provided to or by the Company
and its Representatives in connection with any Takeover Proposal.

(c) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall, directly or indirectly, (i) effect a Change in the Company
Recommendation (subject to the next following sentence in this Section
6.4(c)), (ii) approve any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to,
or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or (iii)
grant any waiver of the ownership limitations contained in the Companys
Constituent Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to,
but not after, the Acceptance Time, the Board of Directors of the Company may,
in response to a Superior Proposal, effect a Change in the Company
Recommendation, _provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and _provided_
, _further_ , that the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect such a
Change in the Company Recommendation unless (i) the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is
prepared to effect a Change in Company Recommendation in response to a
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the facts, circumstances and
other conditions giving rise to such Superior Proposal, and (ii) Parent does
not make, within three Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a
proposal that the Board of Directors determines in good faith, is at least as
favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Proposal. The
Company agrees that, during the three Business Day period prior to its
effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation, the Company and
its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives (if they desire to negotiate) regarding any revisions to the
terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent.

(d) The Company agrees that it will deliver to Parent a new written notice of
Takeover Proposal with respect to each Takeover Proposal that has
been materially revised or modified prior to taking any action to recommend
or agreeing to recommend such Takeover Proposal to the stockholders of the
Company and that a new three Business Day period shall commence for purposes
of this Section 6.4 with respect to each such materially revised or modified
Takeover Proposal from the time Parent receives the written notice of the

complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
in respect of any Takeover Proposal or making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would breach its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, _provided_ ,
_however_ that neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by Section 6.4(c),
effect a Change in Company Recommendation or approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve or recommend, a Takeover Proposal.

stockholders of the Company than the Transactions, taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement), and (y) is
reasonably capable of being consummated on the terms so proposed, taking
into account all financing and financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects

commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice to Parent to the extent
that it acquires actual knowledge of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of

satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied

hereof or as of the Closing Date and (ii) any failure of Parent or Purchaser
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied

(b) If the Company is required to pay Parent a Termination Fee, such
Termination Fee shall be paid into escrow immediately prior to termination of
this Agreement in the event of termination by the Company, and not later than
one Business Day after the receipt by the Company of a notice of termination
from Parent in the event of termination by Parent, in each case by wire

accordance with this Section 8.3(b) (except that, in the case of termination
pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(b)(iii), 8.1(c)(iv) or 8.1(c)(v), such
payment shall be made on the date of the first to occur of either of the
events referred to in clause (B) of Section 8.3(a)(iii)). If the Company is
required to pay Parent a Termination Fee or this Agreement is terminated (A)
pursuant to Sections 8.1(b)(ii), 8.1(b)(iii), 8.1(c)(iv) or 8.1(c)(v) under
the circumstances described in Section 8.3(a)(iii)(A) or (B) pursuant
to Section 8.1(b)(iii) as a result of the Companys failure to use its
commercially reasonable good faith efforts to obtain the Company Required
Consents, the Company shall, in addition to any Termination Fee that may be
payable, reimburse Parent and Purchaser for all of their Expenses, up to a
maximum amount of $1,000,000, within one Business Day of receipt of written
notice from Parent requesting payment thereof. In the event that the Company
is obligated to pay Parent the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to
Parent, from the Termination Fee deposited into escrow in accordance with this
clause (b), an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) the Termination Fee, and
(ii) the sum of: (A) the maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without
causing Parent to fail to meet the  



 

\- 59 -  requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2)(H) or 856(c)(3)(I) of the Code ("Qualifying Income"), as
determined by Parents independent public accountants, plus (B) in the event
Parent receives either (x) a letter from Parents counsel indicating
that Parent has received a ruling from the IRS described below in this
Section 8.2(b) or (y) an opinion from Parents outside counsel as described
below in this Section 8.2(b), an amount equal to the excess of the Termination
Fee less the amount payable under clause (A) above. To secure the Companys
obligation to pay these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Termination Fee with an escrow agent selected by
the Company on such terms (subject to this Section 8.2(b)) as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment
or deposit into escrow of the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)
shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay Parent such amounts
pursuant to Section 8.2 by wire transfer. The escrow agreement shall provide
that the Termination Fee in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be
released to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of
the following: (i) a letter from Parents independent public accountants
indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent
without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute Qualifying Income, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that
(A) Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Parent
of the Termination Fee would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code or (B) Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Fee would either
constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within
the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the
escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Fee to Parent. The
Company agrees to amend this Section 8.2(b) at the reasonable request of
Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination Fee that may be
distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve Parents
chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 8.2(b) or
(iii) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside
counsel as described in this Section 8.2(b).

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), the Company
shall be entitled to retain the Deposit as the Companys liquidated damages
(and not as a penalty) and as the Companys exclusive remedy for the
Purchasers default in the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(i), it being agreed by the parties that it would
be impracticable and extremely difficult to ascertain the actual damages
suffered by the Company as a result of the Purchasers failure to complete the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, under the circumstances
existing as of the date hereof, the liquidated damages provided for herein
represent a reasonable estimate of the damages which the Company would incur
as a result of such failure. If this Agreement is terminated for any reason
other than pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i), the Deposit, together with all
interest earned thereon, if any, shall forthwith be paid to the Purchaser.

(d) The parties each agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.3
are an integral part of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails  



 

\- 60 -  promptly to pay any amounts due under this Section 8.3 and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment
against the Company for such amounts, the Company shall pay interest on such
amounts from the date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual
payment at the prime rate plus 4% of Northern Trust in effect on the date such
payment was due, together with the costs and expenses of Parent (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, without regard to the limitation contained
in Section 8.3(b) in connection with such suit.

     | (c) | Subject to Section 4(d) below, upon Escrow Agents receipt
by Purchaser of a copy of written notice of Companys default under the Merger
Agreement, Escrow Agent shall deliver the Fund to Purchaser after five (5)
business days prior written notice to the Parties. Notification hereunder
shall be in the same manner set forth in paragraph 4(a) above. 
---|---|--- 


     | (d) | Notwithstanding the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall give five
(5) business days written notice to the Parties prior to any disbursement of
the Fund. Notification hereunder shall be in the same manner set forth in
paragraph 4(a) above. If the non-receiving party objects to any disbursement
of the Deposit, such party shall provide written notice by 5pm (CST) on such
5th business day of its objection to the other party and Escrow Agent, and
thereafter the Escrow Agent shall only disburse the objected funds upon
receipt of joint written instruction from the Parties or a final and non-
appealable court order along with an opinion of counsel stating that such
order is final and non-appealable. 
---|---|--- 

Upon delivery of the Fund by the Escrow Agent, this Escrow Agreement shall
terminate, subject to the provisions of Section 8\. The Party who receives
the Fund is referred to herein as the "Recipient".

5\. Escrow Agent. (a) The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are
specifically and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely
ministerial in nature, and no other duties shall be implied. The Escrow Agent
shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have
any requirements to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other
agreement, instrument or document between the Parties, in connection herewith,
if any, including without limitation the Merger Agreement (the "Underlying
Agreement"), nor shall the Escrow Agent be required to determine if any person
or entity has complied with any such agreements, nor shall any additional
obligations of the Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of
such agreements, even though reference thereto may be made in this Escrow
Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of
this Escrow Agreement, those of the Underlying Agreement, any schedule or
exhibit attached to the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement among the
Parties, the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement shall control. The
Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining
from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or request
furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper Party or Parties without inquiry and without
requiring substantiating evidence of any kind. The Escrow Agent shall be
under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content
of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall
have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it or the Fund,
including, without limitation, the Escrow Deposit nor shall the Escrow Agent
have any duty or obligation to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness
of any amounts deposited with it hereunder.

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that a final
adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow
Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any
loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and
perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through attorneys, and shall
be liable  



 

2  only for its gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally adjudicated
in a court of competent jurisdiction) in the selection of any such attorney.
The Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled
persons to be selected and retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be
liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in
accordance with, or in reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any such
counsel, accountants or other skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow
Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties
or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any
party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of
this Escrow Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action
and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in
escrow until it shall be given a direction in writing by the Parties which
eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent
or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute without making the Escrow Agent a party to the
same. Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no
event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive,
indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but
not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Any
liability of the Escrow Agent under this Escrow Agreement will be limited to
the amount of fees paid to the Escrow Agent.

6. Succession. (a) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its
duties or obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in
writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or
for other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be
binding upon all of the parties hereto. Escrow Agents sole responsibility
after such thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Fund
(without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a
designated substitute escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the
directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction,
at which time of delivery Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and
terminate, subject to the provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereunder. The Escrow
Agent shall have the right to withhold an amount equal to any amount due and
owing to the Escrow Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent shall
reasonably believe may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the
termination of the Escrow Agreement.

(b) Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all
the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.

7\. Compensation and Reimbursement. The Recipient agrees to (a) pay the
Escrow Agent for the services to be rendered hereunder, which unless otherwise
agreed in writing shall be as described in Schedule 2 attached hereto, and (b)
pay or reimburse the Escrow Agent upon request for all expenses,
disbursements and advances, including, without limitation reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses, incurred or made by it in connection with the
performance of this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent shall deduct its
Escrow Agent fees from the Fund.

8\. Indemnity. The Parties shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and
save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective
successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the "indemnitees") from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties,
judgments, settlements, actions, suits, proceedings, litigation,
investigations, costs or expenses of outside counsel (collectively "Losses")
arising out of or in connection with (a) the Escrow Agents execution and
performance of this Escrow Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the
enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Escrow
Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the
indemnitee, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such
Losses are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have
been primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or other directions, whether
joint or singular, from the Parties, except to the extent that its following
any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof.
The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive
the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the
termination of this Escrow Agreement. The Parties hereby grant the Escrow
Agent a lien on, right of set-off against and security interest in, the Fund
for the payment of any claim for indemnification, fees, expenses and amounts
due hereunder. In furtherance  



 

3  of the foregoing, the Escrow Agent is expressly authorized and directed, but
shall not be obligated, to charge against and withdraw from the Fund for its
own account or for the account of an indemnitee any amounts due to the Escrow
Agent or to an indemnitee under this Section 8\. The obligations contained in
this Section 8 shall survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement and
the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent.

9\. Patriot Act Disclosure/Taxpayer Identification Numbers/Tax Reporting.

(a) Patriot Act Disclosure. Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires the Escrow Agent to
implement reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that
opens a new account with it. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge that Section
326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the Escrow Agents identity verification
procedures require the Escrow Agent to obtain information which may be used to
confirm the Parties identity including without limitation name, address and
organizational documents ("identifying information"). The Parties agree to
provide the Escrow Agent with and consent to the Escrow Agent obtaining from
third parties any such identifying information required as a condition of
opening an account with or using any service provided by the Escrow Agent.

(b) Taxpayer Identification Numbers ("TINs")

The Parties have provided the Escrow Agent with their respective fully
executed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-8, or W-9 and/or other
required documentation. The Parties each represent that its correct TIN
assigned by the IRS, or any other taxing authority, is set forth in the
delivered forms, as well as in the Substitute IRS Form W-9 set forth on the
signature page of this Escrow Agreement.

(c) Tax Reporting

All interest or other income earned under the Escrow Agreement shall be
allocated to Company and reported, as and to the extent required by law, by
the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing authority, on IRS Form 1099
or 1042S (or other appropriate form) as income earned from the Escrow Deposit
by Purchaser whether or not said income has been distributed during such year.
Any other tax returns required to be filed will be prepared and filed by
Purchaser and/or Company with the IRS and any other taxing authority as
required by law. The Parties acknowledge and agree that Escrow Agent shall
have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any income,
franchise or any other tax return with respect to the Fund or any income
earned by the Escrow Deposit. The Parties further acknowledge and agree that
any taxes payable from the income earned on the investment of any sums held in
the Escrow Deposit shall be paid by Recipient. In the absence of written
direction from the Parties, all proceeds of the Fund shall be retained in the
Fund and reinvested from time to time by the Escrow Agent as provided in this
Escrow Agreement. Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems appropriate,
including but not limited to required withholding in the absence of proper
tax documentation, and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.

10\. Notices. All communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed to be duly given and received:

(a) upon delivery, if delivered personally, or upon confirmed transmittal, if
by facsimile;

(b) on the next Business Day (as hereinafter defined) if sent by overnight
courier; or

 

(c) four (4) Business Days after mailing if mailed by prepaid registered mail,
return receipt requested, to the appropriate notice address set forth below
or at such other address as any party hereto may have furnished to the other
parties in writing by registered mail, return receipt requested.

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 10, such
communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date received by an
officer of the Escrow Agent or any employee of the Escrow Agent who reports
directly to any such officer at the above-referenced office. In the event
that the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine that an
emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use such other means of communication
as the Escrow Agent deems appropriate. "Business Day" shall mean any day
other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the Escrow Agent
located at the notice address set forth above is authorized or required by law
or executive order to remain closed.

11\. Security Procedures. (a) In the event funds transfer instructions are
given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow
Agreement), whether in writing, by facsimile or otherwise, the Escrow Agent
is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back
to the person or persons designated on schedule 1 hereto ("Schedule 1"), and
the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be
the person or persons so designated. Each funds transfer instruction shall be
executed by an authorized signatory, a list of such authorized signatories is
set forth on Schedule 1. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may
be changed only in a writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow
Agent. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized
representatives identified in Schedule 1, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to
any Partys executive officers ("Executive Officers"), as the case may be,
which shall include the titles of Chairman, President, CFO or CIO, as the
Escrow Agent may select. Such "Executive Officer" shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a fully executed incumbency certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely
upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The Escrow
Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon
any account numbers or similar identifying numbers provided by Purchaser or
Company to identify (a) the beneficiary, (b) the beneficiarys bank, or (c)
an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for
any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even when its
use may result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or
the transfer of funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an
intermediary bank designated. The Parties acknowledge that these security
procedures are commercially reasonable.

(b) Purchaser and Company acknowledge that repetitive funds transfer
instructions may be given to the Escrow Agent for one or more beneficiaries
where only the date of the requested transfer, the amount of funds to be
transferred, and/or the description of the payment shall change within the
repetitive instructions ("Standing Settlement Instructions"). Accordingly,
Purchaser and Company shall deliver to Escrow Agent such specific Standing
Settlement Instructions only for each respective beneficiary as set forth in
Exhibit A to this Escrow Agreement, by facsimile or other written instruction.
Escrow Agent may rely solely upon such Standing Settlement Instructions and
all identifying information set forth therein for each beneficiary. Escrow
Agent, Purchaser, and Company agree that such Standing Settlement Instructions
shall be effective as the funds transfer instructions of Purchaser and
Company, without requiring a verifying callback, whether or not authorized, if
such Standing Settlement Instructions are consistent with previously
authenticated Standing Settlement Instructions for that beneficiary. The
Parties and Escrow Agent acknowledge that such Standing Settlement
Instructions are a security procedure and are commercially reasonable.

12\. Compliance with Court Orders. In the event that any escrow property
shall be attached, garnished or



 

6 levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or
enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court order affecting the property deposited under this
Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole
discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered
or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own choosing is binding
upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it
shall not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person,
entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such
writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside
or vacated.

 

13\. Miscellaneous. The provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be waived,
altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing
signed by the Escrow Agent and the Parties. Neither this Escrow Agreement nor
any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by the
Escrow Agent or any Party, except as provided in Section 6, without the prior
consent of the Escrow Agent and the other parties. This Escrow Agreement
shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Illinois.
Each Party irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum
non-conveniens or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of
process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and
consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of Illinois.
The Parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with respect to
any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Escrow
Agreement. No party to this Escrow Agreement is liable to any other party for
losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms
of this Escrow Agreement because of, acts of God, fire, war, terrorism,
floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or
other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Escrow Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. All signatures of the parties to this Escrow Agreement may be
transmitted by facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all purposes,
be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature it
reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this
Escrow Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of
any applicable law of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and
any such prohibition or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not
invalidate or render unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction.
A person who is not a party to this Escrow Agreement shall have no right to
enforce any term of this Escrow Agreement. The parties represent, warrant and
covenant that each document, notice, instruction or request provided by such
Party to Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and regulations.
Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any such applicable law may be
waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the parties hereto to the
fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this Escrow Agreement shall
be enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in Section 8 above,
nothing in this Escrow Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be
construed to give to any person or entity other than the Escrow Agent and the
Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim under or in
respect of this Escrow Agreement or any funds escrowed hereunder.

FORM OF REIT OPINION [ Date ]

GCP REIT II

GCP Sunshine Acquisition, Inc.

560 Oakwood Avenue, Suite 100

Lake Forest, Illinois 60045



     | Re: | _Certain Federal Income Tax Matters_ 
---|---|--- 

Ladies and Gentlemen: 

You have requested our opinion concerning certain Federal income tax
considerations in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as
of December 9, 2008 (the "Merger Agreement"), among GCP REIT II, a Maryland
real estate investment trust ("Parent"), GCP Sunshine Acquisition, Inc., a
Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Purchaser"), American Land Lease, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("ALL"), and
Asset Investors Operating Partnership, L.P, a Delaware limited partnership
("Asset Investors OP").

We have acted as tax counsel to ALL in connection with the Merger Agreement,
and we have assisted in the preparation of the Merger Agreement.
In connection with this opinion, we have examined originals or copies,
certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of the Merger Agreement
and such other documentation and information provided by ALL as we have deemed
necessary or appropriate as a basis for the opinion set forth herein. In
addition, ALL has provided us with, and we are relying upon, the initial and
continuing accuracy of a certificate containing certain factual statements,
factual representations, and covenants of officers of ALL (the "Officers
Certificate") relating to, among other things, the actual and proposed
operation of ALL and the entities in which it holds, or has held, a direct or
indirect interest (collectively, the "Company"). For purposes of our opinion,
we have not made an independent investigation of the facts, statements,
representations, and covenants set forth in the Officers Certificate, the
Merger Agreement, or in any other document. In addition, we note that the
Company may engage in transactions in connection with which we have not
provided legal advice, and have not reviewed, and of which we may be unaware.
We have, consequently, assumed and relied on ALLs representations that the
information presented in such documents (including representations as to the
nature of the Companys assets and operations in prior years),  GCP REIT II, LLC

GCP Sunshine Acquisition, Inc.

or otherwise furnished to us, accurately and completely describes all material
facts relevant to our opinion. We have also relied upon your representation
in Section 4.6 of the Merger Agreement that the acquisition of Shares (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) by Purchaser or Parent pursuant to the Merger
Agreement will not adversely affect ALLs compliance with the stock
ownership requirements applicable to REITs as contained in Sections
856(a)(5), (a)(6) and (h) of the Code. We have assumed that all such facts,
statements, representations and covenants are true without regard to any
qualification as to knowledge, belief, or intent. No facts have come to our
attention, however, that would cause us to question the accuracy and
completeness of such facts or documents in a material way. Our opinion is
conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such facts,
statements, representations and covenants. Any material change or inaccuracy
in the facts, statements, representations, and covenants referred to, set
forth, or assumed herein or in the Officers Certificate may affect
our conclusions set forth herein. We have also relied upon conclusions 1.,
2., and 3., and the analysis corresponding thereto, contained in the opinion
of Ernst and Young LLP, dated December 31, 1998 regarding a securitized
financing undertaken by a former subsidiary of ALLs predecessor.

In our review of certain documents in connection with our opinion
as expressed below, we have assumed the legal capacity of all natural
persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents
submitted to us as originals, the conformity to original documents of all
documents submitted to us as certified, conformed, photostatic, or electronic
copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such copies. Where documents
have been provided to us in draft form, we have assumed that the final
executed versions of such documents will not differ materially from such
drafts.

Our opinion is also based on the correctness of the following assumptions: (i)
ALL, and each of the entities comprising the Company, has been and will
continue to be operated in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it was formed, and in the manner described in the relevant partnership
agreement or other organizational documents, (ii) there will be no changes in
the applicable laws of the State of Delaware or of any other jurisdiction
under the laws of which any of the entities comprising the Company have been
formed, and (iii) each of the written agree   GCP REIT II, LLC

ments to which the Company is a party has been and will be implemented,
construed and enforced in accordance with its terms, without regard to any
parol evidence. 

In rendering our opinion, we have considered and relied upon the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the regulations promulgated
thereunder ("Regulations"), administrative rulings and other Treasury
interpretations of the Code and the Regulations by the courts and the Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS"), all as they exist at the date hereof. It should be
noted that the Code, Regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative
interpretations are subject to change at any time and, in some circumstances,
with retroactive effect. A material change that is made after the date
hereof in any of the foregoing bases for our opinion could affect our
conclusions set forth herein. In this regard, an opinion of counsel with
respect to an issue represents counsels best judgment as to the outcome on
the merits with respect to such issue, is not binding on the IRS or the
courts, and is not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary
position with respect to such issue or that a court will not sustain such a
position if asserted by the IRS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH TREASURY DEPARTMENT CIRCULAR 230 AND PURSUANT TO YOUR
REQUEST, YOU AND WE HAVE AGREED THAT THIS OPINION ADDRESSES, CONSIDERS
AND PROVIDES CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO ONLY THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX
MATTERS DISCUSSED HEREIN. ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT ARE NOT DISCUSSED IN THIS
OPINION COULD AFFECT THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF THE COMPANY OR
THE MATTER THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE OPINION. TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH
TREASURY DEPARTMENT REGULATIONS, WE ADVISE YOU THAT, UNLESS OTHERWISE
EXPRESSLY INDICATED, ANY FEDERAL TAX ADVICE CONTAINED IN THIS OPINION WAS NOT
INTENDED OR WRITTEN TO BE USED, AND CANNOT BE USED, FOR THE PURPOSE OF
AVOIDING TAX-RELATED PENALTIES UNDER THE CODE.

We express no opinion as to the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
Federal laws of the United States of America to the extent specifically
referred to herein. GCP REIT II, LLC

Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, commencing
with its taxable year ended December 31, 1998, ALL was organized in
conformity with the requirements for qualification as a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") under the Code, and its actual and proposed method of operation
up to and including the Acceptance Time within the meaning of the Merger
Agreement (the "Acceptance Time")1, as represented in the Officers
Certificate, has enabled it and will enable it to satisfy the requirements
for qualification as a REIT up to and including the Acceptance Time. We
express no opinion with respect to any taxable year of ALL ended prior to
1998. ALLs qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon its ability to
meet, through actual annual operating results, certain requirements, including
requirements with respect to the source of its income, the composition of its
assets, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, and various
other requirements imposed under the Code, the results of which are not
reviewed by us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the actual results
of ALLs operation for any one taxable year satisfy the requirements for
taxation as a REIT under the Code.

Although the opinion expressed herein relates to the satisfaction of the REIT
qualification requirements through the Acceptance Time, the REIT qualification
requirements (including those relating to a REITs gross income, assets, and
distributions) are normally tested at the end of or for the calendar quarter
or calendar year. Therefore, this opinion is not being rendered and shall not
be effective to the extent that any fact, matter or thing (including, without
limitation, any item or amount of gross income, any asset, the composition of
ALLs stockholders, or the absence of any distribution) occurs or does not
occur on or after the Acceptance Time that adversely affects ALLs
qualification as a REIT. In particular, and without limiting the foregoing,
the opinion expressed herein shall not be rendered or be effective if ALL
shall fail to meet its (i) distributions (and deduction for dividends paid)
requirement under Section 857(a) of the Code (which requirement is tested on a
taxable year basis), or (ii) REIT stockholder requirements under Sections
856(a)(5), (a)(6) and (h) of the Code, for any taxable period ending after the
Acceptance Time.2

The opinion will be delivered on the earlier to close of the Tender Offer (if
applicable) or Merger (as defined in the Merger Agreement). References to
"Acceptance Time" will be replaced with references to the "Effective Time" if
the opinion is issued for the Merger rather than the Tender Offer.

We express no opinion on any issue relating to ALL or the Company or any
investment therein, other than as expressly stated above.

This opinion has been prepared for you pursuant to Section 7.2 and Annex I,
paragraph 2(iv) of the Merger Agreement. It may not be relied upon by anyone
else without our prior written consent, except that we consent to DLA Piper
LLP (US)s reliance on this opinion regarding the status of ALL as a REIT with
respect to time periods covered by this opinion, subject to all terms,
conditions and qualifications set forth in this opinion, including the
continuing truthfulness, accuracy and completeness of the facts and
assumptions set forth in this opinion and the representations set forth in the
Officers Certificate upon which this opinion relies. Our consent to DLA
Piper LLP (US)s reliance on this opinion is given solely for purposes of
their opinion regarding the status of ALL as a REIT and our consent should not
be construed as permitting reliance on our opinion for any other purpose. We
express no opinion as to the status of ALL as a REIT after the Acceptance
Time.

This opinion is expressed as of the date hereof, and we are under no
obligation to supplement or revise our opinion to reflect any legal
developments or factual matters arising subsequent to the date hereof, or the
impact of any information, document, certificate, record,
statement, representation, covenant, or assumption relied upon herein that
becomes incorrect or untrue.

Very truly yours, 





forward merger in which ALL merges with and into Purchaser.
