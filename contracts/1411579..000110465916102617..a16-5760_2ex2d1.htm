($30.00) in cash, without interest (such per share amount, the " **Merger
Consideration** ").

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) All of the shares of Company Stock converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article 2_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist as of
the Effective Time, and, subject to _Section 2.03_, each certificate
previously representing any such shares of Company Stock (each a "
**Certificate** ") or uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "
**Uncertificated Shares** ") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.03. _ Surrender and Payment._

 



 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the
Person authorized to act as exchange agent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which Person shall be selected by Parent and
be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** "), pursuant
to any agreement reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company entered into
prior to the Effective Time, immediately available funds equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration (such cash, collectively being referred to as
the " **Exchange Fund** "). Such cash funds may be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration or other amounts payable
hereunder, (ii) if, for any reason (including if Dissenting Shares cease to be
Dissenting Shares), the cash in the Exchange Fund becomes insufficient to make
the payments contemplated by this _Article 2_, then Parent shall promptly
provide additional cash to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the former
stockholders of the Company sufficient to make the payments contemplated by
this _Article 2_ and (iii) such investments shall only be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
thirty (30) days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as Parent directs.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than three (3) Business
Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of shares of Company Stock a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) and shall be in such form and
have such other or different provisions as Parent shall reasonably designate
for use in such exchange. Upon proper surrender of the Certificates for
exchange (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and cancellation or transfer
of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent, together with such
properly completed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
check representing an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of shares
of Company Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent). Until so surrendered, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration. The Parent, the Company and the Exchange Agent may
agree on transfer procedures in addition to or different from the procedures
set forth above in order to effect the transfer and conversion of the Company
Stock in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer, and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any

 



      
 

 



 

transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been
paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 2_ upon conversion of any shares of the Company Stock shall be
deemed to have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of the Company Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, subject to Delaware Law in the case of Dissenting Shares, all holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share in accordance with this
_Article 2_. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former
holders of shares of Company Stock as of the one year anniversary of the
Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand. Any former
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
_Article 2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Applicable Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of
Company Stock as such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Company, the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration to
be paid in accordance with this _Article 2_ that remains undistributed to any
former holder of Company Stock, as of immediately prior to the date on which
the Merger Consideration that would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Authority, shall, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 2.04. _ Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding _Section 2.02_, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing with respect to such shares and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Delaware Law (" **Dissenting Shares** ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the
Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist,
and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights
granted to them pursuant to Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right
to appraisal with respect to such shares, in any case pursuant to Delaware
Law, such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any

 



      
 

 



 

demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or as required
by Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



 

Section 2.05. _ Company Equity and Equity-Based Awards_.

shall, contingent upon consummation of the Merger, (i) become 100% vested and
(ii) be exercisable at any time during the seven day period prior to the
Effective Time (the " **Option Exercise Period** "), reasonable notice of
which shall be provided by the Company. Each share of Company Stock received
in connection with the exercise of Company Stock Options will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.02_. To the extent
not exercised within the Option Exercise Period, each outstanding Company
Stock Option shall, at the Effective Time, be canceled, automatically and
without any action on behalf of the holder thereof, and the Company shall pay
each holder of such canceled Company Stock Option an amount in cash (less any
applicable Tax withholding), determined by multiplying (x) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option by (y) the number of shares of Company
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option; _provided_ that if the per share
exercise price payable with respect to a Company Stock Option exceeds the
Merger Consideration (an " **Underwater Option** "), then such Underwater
Option shall be canceled without payment of any consideration with respect
thereto.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of restricted stock
that is then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans (each, an award of "
**Company Restricted Shares** "), whether or not vested, shall, contingent
upon consummation of the Merger, become 100% vested and all outstanding
issuance and forfeiture conditions shall be deemed 100% satisfied, and the
holders of such shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.02_.

 



 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock
units that is then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans (each, an award
of " **Company Restricted Stock Units** "), whether or not vested, shall,

outstanding issuance and forfeiture conditions shall be deemed 100% satisfied,
and the Company shall with respect to the holder of any such Company
Restricted Stock Units (i) issue the number of shares of Company Stock
underlying such Company Restricted Stock Units, which shares shall be entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.02_, and (ii) pay
in cash all dividend equivalents, if any, accrued but unpaid as of the
Effective Time with respect to the number of shares of Company Stock
underlying such Company Restricted Stock Units.

 



 

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of performance shares
that is then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans (each, an award of "
**Company Performance Shares** "), whether or not vested, or whether or not
performance criteria have been achieved, shall, contingent upon consummation
of the Merger, become 100% vested and all outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

issuance and forfeiture conditions shall be deemed 100% satisfied with respect
to (i) the actual number of shares of Company Stock earned for each
performance period completed prior to the Effective Time, as determined by the
Company prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
applicable award agreements and the Company Stock Plans in existence as of the
date hereof, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock equal to the
specified number of target shares for any performance period during which the
Effective Time occurs and for each succeeding performance period covered by
such Company Performance Shares, and the holders of such shares shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.02_.

 



 

(e) The Company shall terminate the Company Stock Plans immediately as of the
Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, no participant in any
Company Stock Plan shall have any right under any such Company Stock Plan
other than the right to receive the awards or payments in accordance with the
terms of this _Section 2.05_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to obtain any consents and make any amendments to
the terms of any outstanding awards under the Company Stock Plans as may be
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.05_. The Company will take steps necessary to arrange for all required Tax
withholdings with respect to the Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted
Stock Units, and Company Performance Shares. The Company shall ensure that, as
of immediately following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock
Option, Company Restricted Shares, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company
Performance Shares (or former holder or a participant in any Company Stock
Plan) shall have any rights thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect
of, the capital stock of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries, or any other equity interest therein, except for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration described in this _Section 2.05_. All
payments under this _Section 2.05_ shall be made at or as soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, pursuant to the Companys ordinary payroll
practices, and shall be subject to any applicable withholding.

 



 

(f) The Company shall take all of the following actions (including adoption of
any required amendments) with respect to the Carmike Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " **ESPP** "): (i) unless otherwise agreed between the Parties,
suspend the ESPP effective no later than after the close of business on March
31, 2016, so that no purchases of Company Stock shall be permitted with
respect to purchase periods commencing on or after April 1, 2016 and (ii)
terminate the ESPP immediately as of the Effective Time so that no further
purchase rights shall accrue after the Effective Time. All ESPP participants
will automatically receive their accrued purchase rights under the ESPP upon
the termination of the ESPP.

 



 

Section 2.06. _ Withholding Rights._ The Exchange Agent (or the Company, if
necessary pursuant to _Section 2.05_) (or, subsequent to the one year
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration and any other
cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as the
Exchange Agent, the Company, or Parent, as the case may be, is required to
deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the
amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, the Company, Parent, or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, such

 



      
 

 



 

withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made.

 



 

Section 2.07. _ Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such amount as the Surviving Corporation,
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or if subsequent to the termination of the
Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 2.03(e)_, Parent) will pay, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration.

have been corrected by any subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, the
Company SEC Documents filed pursuant to the 1934 Act did not, and the Company

Agreement, to the Companys auditors and audit committee of the Companys
Board of Directors (x) all "significant deficiencies" and "material
weaknesses" (as such terms are defined by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board) in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a

 



      
 

 



 

significant role in the Companys internal controls. The Company has made

disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit committee of

any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation
or benefits under, or increase the amount payable or trigger any other

the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, after the Effective

rise to the payment of any amount pursuant to any contract or agreement

medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees of
the Company except as required to avoid excise Tax under Section 4980B of the
Code or applicable state law.

by the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, an Company Employee Plan which would increase
materially the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the
level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended

Parent and Merger Subsidiary other than the adoption of this Agreement by the

with twenty-four (24) hours of the signing of this Agreement. This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary enforceable against Parent and the Merger Subsidiary in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. No vote of the
holders of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, Parent Class B Common Stock
or any other shares of Parents capital stock is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.03. _ Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing by Parent or Merger

certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the Delaware Secretary
of State and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other
states in which Parent is qualified to do business, (b) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of laws analogous to the HSR Act
existing in foreign jurisdictions, (c) compliance with any applicable

Material Adverse Effect. Assuming the accuracy of the representation and
warranty of the Company contained in the last sentence of _Section 4.03_,
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates nor any Wanda Group Party is required
to take any action in respect of, make any filing with, or obtain any approval

Wanda Group Party any financing or the benefit of any guarantees, in each
case, in connection with or relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.04. _ Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section
5.03_, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
Applicable Law, (c) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
_Section 5.03_, require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation,
acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the loss of any
benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in
the case of each of clauses (b) through (d), as would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

use in the Company Proxy Statement, at the date of mailing to the Companys
stockholders and at the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material

not misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this _Section
5.05_ will not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by

respect to such Proceeding or (d) any of Parent or its Subsidiaries assets or
properties, before (or, in the case of threatened Proceedings, would be

those Proceedings that have not had, or would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As
of the date hereof, there is no Proceeding pending against or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that in any manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or delay the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby. There is no
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority outstanding or, to the knowledge of Parent threatened against, or
investigation by any Governmental Authority involving, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except for those that have not had or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

Section 5.07. _ Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in
each case, whether oral or written), or authorized, committed or agreed to
enter into any contract, arrangement or understanding (in each case, whether
oral or written), pursuant to which: (a) any stockholder of the Company would
be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature than the
Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the Company (i)
agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii) agrees to vote

Section 5.10. _ Financing_.

 



 

(a) Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
_Section 9.02(a)_, _Section 9.02(b)_ and _Section 9.02(c)_, Parent has
available to it, or will have available to it as of the date the Closing is
required to occur pursuant to _Section 2.01_, immediately available funds to
enable it to consummate the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement,
including to pay all Merger Consideration for all of the shares of Company
Stock on a fully-diluted basis, to make all payments in respect of the Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance Shares and
Company Restricted Stock Units to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary and their respective Representatives, and to make all other
payments required by this Agreement and the Financing.

 



 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of fully
executed commitment letters, dated on the date hereof (including the exhibits
and annexes thereto, the " **Debt Commitment Letters** "), from the lenders
party thereto (the " **Lenders** ") confirming their respective commitments to
provide Parent with debt financing in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " **Financing** ") (for the avoidance of doubt, it
being acknowledged and agreed that Parent may amend the Debt Commitment
Letters to add

 



      
 

 



 

purchasers, lenders, lead arrangers, book-runners, syndication agents or
similar entities who had not executed any Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ that no such addition shall relieve the
original Lenders of their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters prior
to the initial funding of the Financing, except as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters with respect to the "Additional Initial Lenders" (as
defined thereunder)).

 



 

(c) Parent has delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof true,
correct and complete copies of any fee letters executed in connection with the
Debt Commitment Letters (the " **Fee Letters** ") which have been redacted in
a manner required by the terms thereof. As of the date hereof, there are no
side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the
funding of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letters and the Fee Letters and delivered to the Company on or
prior to the date of this Agreement, that could adversely affect the
availability of the full amount of the Financing.

 



 

(d) Each of the Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a
valid and binding obligation of Parent and the other parties thereto, except
(i) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and
Equity Exception and (ii) that the availability of equitable remedies,
including specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the court
before which any proceeding thereof may be brought. As of the date hereof,
none of the Debt Commitment Letters have been amended or modified (other than
such amendments or modifications attached thereto that have been provided to
the Company) in any respect, and the respective commitments contained therein
have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in a manner that
would adversely affect or delay in any respect the availability of the full
amount of the Financing at the Closing. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default), or the failure of
any condition on the part of Parent under the Debt Commitment Letters or on
the part of the Lenders that would adversely affect or delay in any respect
the availability of the full amount of the Financing at the Closing. There are
no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
other than the conditions precedent set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters.
Assuming the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section
9.02(a)_, _Section 9.02(b)_ and _Section 9.02(c)_, Parent has no reason to
believe that the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. Assuming
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.02(a)_,
_Section 9.02(b)_ and _Section 9.02(c)_ and subject to the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letters, the aggregate proceeds of the Financing are in an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement (including to pay the Merger Consideration for all of the shares of
Company Stock on a fully diluted basis and to make all payments in respect of
the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance
Shares and Company Restricted Stock Units), to make any repayment or
refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letters, and to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement and the
Financing. Parent (or an Affiliate thereof) has fully paid or caused to be
paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Debt Commitment
Letters to be paid to the extent the same are due and payable on or before the
date of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of

 



      
 

 



 

Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.11. _ Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligations to consummate the Merger and (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 4_ and, after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Financing, any alternative financing, the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters, and the payment of all related fees
and expenses, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **Solvent** " when used with respect to any Person, on a
consolidated basis, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the fair
value of the assets of such Person will exceed their consolidated debt and
liabilities, contingent or otherwise, (ii) the present fair saleable value of
the property of such Person will be greater than the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liability on their debts and other liabilities
contingent or otherwise, as such debts and other liabilities become absolute
and mature, (iii) such Person will not have unreasonably small capital with
which to conduct the business in which it is engaged as such business is now
conducted and is proposed to be conducted following such date and (iv) such
Person will not have incurred and do not intend to incur, or believe they will
incur, any debts and liabilities, contingent or otherwise, including current
obligations, that they do not believe that they will be able to pay (based on
their assets and cash flow) as such debts and liabilities become due (whether
at maturity or otherwise).

 



 

Section 5.12. _ Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary,
nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, nor at any time in the three
year period prior to the date of this Agreement has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law). Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary, nor
any of their "associates" or "controlled affiliates" owns any shares of
Company Stock, and no "affiliates" of Parent or Merger Subsidiary that are not
"controlled affiliates" "owns" individually or in the aggregate more than five
(5) percent of the outstanding shares of Company Stock.

 



 

Section 5.13. _ Management Agreements_. Other than as contemplated by this
Agreement, as of the date hereof, there are no contracts, undertakings,
commitments, agreements or obligations or understandings between Parent or
Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any member of the Companys management
or the Companys Board of Directors, on the other hand, relating in any way to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the
Company after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 5.14. _ Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary have received and may continue to receive from the
Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts

 



      
 

 



 

and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with
which Parent and Merger Subsidiary are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Subsidiary are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Subsidiary will have no claim, right or
obligation under this Agreement or otherwise (including under _Article 9_)
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Representatives, or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge that none of the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective Representatives, nor any
other Person, has made or is making any representation or warranty with
respect to such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements
or business plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking statements or business
plans).

Section 6.02. _ Company Stockholder Meeting_. The Company shall cause a
meeting of its stockholders (the " **Company Stockholder Meeting** "), which
may, at the discretion of the Company, be the Companys annual meeting of
stockholders, to be duly noticed, called and convened as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and, subject to the provisions in the remainder of
this _Section 6.02_, in no event more than forty-five (45) days) after
confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments to the Company Proxy
Statement, for the purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger a resolution to adjourn the Company Stockholder
Meeting, if necessary or appropriate to solicit additional proxies if there
are not sufficient votes to adopt the Agreement, and a resolution to vote on a
non-binding advisory proposal to approve change-in-control payments to
executives of the Company. Except as required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not submit any other proposal to its stockholders at the Company
Stockholder Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that, if
the Company Stockholder Meeting is also the Companys annual meeting of
stockholders, then the Company may, without the prior written consent of
Parent, submit to its stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting
proposals with respect to the election of the Companys nominees to the Board
of Directors of the Company, the ratification of the Companys independent
registered public accounting firm, and the approval on a non-binding advisory
basis of the Companys executive compensation. The record date and the meeting
date of the Company Stockholder Meeting shall be selected by the Company after
reasonable consultation with Parent. Subject to _Section 6.04_, (a) the Board
of Directors of the Company shall recommend approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Companys stockholders and the Company shall
include the Company Board Recommendation in the Company Proxy Statement, (b)
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval and (c) the Company shall otherwise comply in all
material respects with the legal requirements applicable to the Company
Stockholder Meeting. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if on a date within
two (2) Business Days of the date the Company Stockholder Meeting is scheduled
(or, if previously postponed or adjourned, is scheduled to reconvene), the
Company has not received proxies representing the Company Stockholder
Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the Company may postpone or
adjourn, or make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of, the
Company Stockholder Meeting (and the Company shall, at the request of Parent
and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, make one such adjournment if
the Company has not previously effected any such postponement or adjournment)
as long as the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting is not, without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), postponed or adjourned to a date that is
later than the later of (accounting for all postponements or adjournments in
reliance upon this proviso (i)) (A) thirty

 



      
 

 



 

(30) calendar days in the aggregate from the date of the originally scheduled
Company Stockholder Meeting and (B) ten (10) Business Days following the
termination of the Negotiation Period pursuant to _Section 6.04(f)_ and (ii)
if required by Applicable Law to provide the Companys stockholders additional
information or disclosure in connection with the matters to be voted upon at
the Company Stockholder Meeting, the Company shall make one or more successive
adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting only for such period of time
as is reasonably necessary in order to give the Companys stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate such additional information or disclosure. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep Parent reasonably
updated concerning proxy solicitation results for the Company Stockholder
Meeting.

 



 

Section 6.03. _ Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (a) give Parent and its Representatives, upon
reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
offices, properties, books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(b) furnish to Parent and its Representatives such financial and operating
data and other information as such Persons may reasonably request and (c)
instruct its Representatives to cooperate reasonably with Parent in its
investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if the Company does not provide access or information in reliance on the
preceding clause, it shall provide notice to Parent that it is withholding
such access or information and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way
that would not violate Applicable Law or binding agreement or risk the waiver
of attorney-client privilege. Any investigation pursuant to this _Section
6.03_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere unreasonably with
the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Nothing in
this _Section 6.03_ shall require the Company to provide any access, or to
disclose any information (i) if providing such access or disclosing such
information could reasonably be expected to violate any Applicable Law
(including antitrust or privacy laws) or any binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) protected by attorney-client
privilege to the extent such privilege cannot be protected by the Company
through exercise of its reasonable efforts.

 



 

Section 6.04. _ No Solicitation; Other Offers_.

 



 

(a) Except as provided by the remainder of this _Section 6.04_, from the date
hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 10_, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers or directors shall, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall not authorize any of its other
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any
action to knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, including by way of furnishing
any non-public information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries
or any assets owned (in whole or part) by the Company or its Subsidiaries to
any Person in furtherance of an Acquisition Proposal or if it would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party with respect to any potential
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement in principle, memorandum
of understanding, letter of

 



      
 

 



 

intent, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, joint venture agreement,
option agreement or other similar agreement (but excluding an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) providing for a transaction that is the subject of
an Acquisition Proposal (an " **Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "), or
(iv) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
confidentiality agreement concerning an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that
notwithstanding the foregoing and the last sentence of this _Section 6.04(a)_
the Company shall be permitted to waive, amend, release or fail to enforce any
provision of any confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation of any
Person if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable
Law. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and
their respective Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to be
terminated any and all activities, discussions or negotiations, if any,
existing as of the date of this Agreement with any Third Party and its
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly inform its Representatives
of the obligations in this _Section 6.04_. The Company also agrees that it
will promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of
acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return or destroy (as
provided in the terms of such confidentiality agreement) all confidential
information furnished to such Person prior to the date hereof by or on behalf
of it or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any confidentiality agreements
entered into with any Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal if
requested to do so by Parent, subject to the remaining provisions of this
_Section 6.04_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 6.04(a)_ to the contrary,
following the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date
hereof that did not result from a material breach by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives of this _Section
6.04_ and prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if (i) the
Company or any of its Representatives has received an Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and with its financial advisor, reasonably believes is
or could reasonably result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then, subject to
providing written notice to Parent of its decision to take such action and
compliance in all material respects with _Section 6.04(c)_, the Company,
directly or indirectly through its Representatives, may (A) engage in
negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and its Representatives, and
(B) furnish to such Third Party or its Representatives non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) provide to Parent any such
information relating to the Company that it provided to any such Person which
was not previously provided to or made available to Parent.

 



 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing after the receipt by the Company of
any Acquisition Proposal or any request for information or access relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with

 



       
 

 



 

respect to an Acquisition Proposal indicating, in connection with such notice,
the name of such Person (except to the extent disclosure of such identity
would breach a confidentiality obligation in effect prior to the execution of
this Agreement) and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements, which in each case may be redacted, if
necessary to remove the identity of any Third Party to comply with any
confidentiality obligation in effect prior to the execution of this Agreement)
and thereafter, subject to the foregoing confidentiality qualifications, shall
(i) keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt and timely basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any material
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations,
and (ii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable copies of all written
proposals or offers (including proposed agreements) sent or provided to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any Person (or such Persons
Representative) making an Acquisition Proposal that describes any of the
financial or other material terms or conditions of such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(d) Except as set forth in _Section 6.04(e)_ and _Section 6.04(g)_, the
Board of Directors of the Company and each committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company shall not:

 



 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or announce any
intention to or resolve to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Company Board Recommendation;

 



 

(ii) other than in the case of an Acquisition Proposal in the form of a tender
offer or exchange offer, fail to publicly affirm the Company Board
Recommendation upon Parents written request within five (5) Business Days
after such request after a public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(iii) (A) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or exchange
offer that is publicly disclosed (other than by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries) prior to the eleventh (11th) Business Day after the commencement
of such tender or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the 1934 Act or
(B) recommend that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares of
Company Stock in such tender offer or exchange offer;

 



 

(iv) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Company Proxy
Statement in connection with the Company Stockholder Meeting; or

 



 

(v) approve, adopt, recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described in _Sections
6.04(d)(i)_ through _6.04(d)(v)_ being referred to as an " **Adverse
Recommendation Change** ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement but
subject to _Section 6.04(f)_, prior to the time, but not after, the Company
Stockholder Approval is obtained, if an Acquisition Proposal has been made
after the execution of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Acquisition
Proposal or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01_ if, and only
if, (i) such Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives of
this _Section 6.04_; and (ii) the Board of

 



      
 

 



 

Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and with its financial advisor that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(f) Prior to making any Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with an
Acquisition Proposal and prior to terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.01_ (to the extent permitted under _Section 6.04_), the Company
shall deliver to Parent a written notice (a " **Superior Proposal Notice** ")
stating that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such action
pursuant to _Section 6.04_ and, if applicable, intends to cause the Company
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, a copy of the proposed
form of which shall be delivered with such notice, together with copies of any
documents setting forth the Acquisition Proposal (which notice or intent shall
not be an Adverse Recommendation Change or a violation of _Section 6.04(d)_
or any other provision of this _Section 6.04_). During the three (3) Business
Day period commencing on the first Business Day following the date of Parents
receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (the " **Negotiation Period** "), the
Company shall make its Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of
engaging in negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this Agreement so that the
Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice
ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Any written proposal made by Parent to amend
this Agreement during the Negotiation Period shall be considered by the Board
of Directors of the Company in good faith. Each time the financial or other
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal are changed, the Company shall be
required to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice (including as
attachments thereto a copy of the new Alternative Acquisition Agreement
relating to such amended Acquisition Proposal and copies of any related
documents), and the Negotiation Period shall be extended by an additional
three (3) Business Days from the date of Parents receipt of such new Superior
Proposal Notice.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is
obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if, and only if, the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and with its financial advisor that a failure
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall deliver to
Parent a written notice (the " **Intervening Event Notice** ") advising Parent
of all available material information with respect to such Intervening Event
and stating that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such
action pursuant to this _Section 6.04(g)_ (which notice or intent shall not
be an Adverse Recommendation Change or a violation of _Section 6.04(d)_ or
any other provision of this _Section 6.04_). During the three (3) Business
Day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt of the Intervening Event
Notice (the " **Intervening Negotiation Period** "), the Company shall make
its Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
a possible amendment of this Agreement in order to enable the Board of
Directors of the Company to proceed with the Company Board Recommendation. Any
written proposal made by Parent to amend this Agreement during the Intervening
Negotiation Period shall be considered by the Board of Directors of the
Company in good faith.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth this Agreement, unless
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to, and in accordance with, _Section
10.01_, (i) the obligation of the Company to establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, and, subject to _Section 6.02_, convene and hold the
Company Stockholder Meeting and to hold a vote of the Companys stockholders
on the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company Stockholder
Meeting pursuant to _Section 6.02_ shall not be limited or otherwise affected
by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of any
Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or by an Adverse
Recommendation Change, and (ii) in any case in which the Company makes an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 6.04_, the Company
shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to a vote of its stockholders at the
Company Stockholder Meeting for the purpose of the approval of this Agreement.

 



 

(i) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Board
of Directors of the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
1934 Act (or any similar communication to its stockholders in connection with
the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making
any disclosure to its stockholders with regard to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or an Acquisition Proposal which the Board of
Directors of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel) determines
in its good faith judgment that failure to make such disclosure would
reasonably be expected to violate U.S. federal or state securities Law or
other Applicable Law or its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law;
_provided_ that the Board of Directors of the Company may not effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless permitted to do so by this _Section
6.04_; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any "stop, look and listen" disclosure in and of itself shall not be
considered an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) contacting and engaging in
discussions with any Person or group and their respective Representatives who
has made an Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of clarifying such
Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof.

 



 

Section 6.05. _ Company Employee Plan Matters_. At the reasonable request of
Parent, the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, adopt such amendments
and take such other actions with respect to the Company Employee Plans as
Parent may reasonably request to facilitate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.06. _ No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 5_, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that no other representation or warranty of any kind
whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, is made or shall be
deemed to have been made by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries with
respect to their respective businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities,
financial conditions, results of operations or prospects or with respect to
the accuracy or completeness of any other information provided or made
available to Company by or on behalf of Parent or its Subsidiaries, and each
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby disclaims any such representation or
warranty, whether by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and
notwithstanding the delivery or disclosure to the Company, or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates of any documentation or other information by
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of
their Representatives or any of their respective Subsidiaries with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing. Neither Parent, Merger Subsidiary nor any of
their Representatives will have or be

 



      
 

 



 

subject to any liability or obligation to the Company or any other Person
resulting from the distribution in written or verbal communications to the
Company of any such information, including any information, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Company in

agrees, to do the following:

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(each, an " **Indemnified Person** ") in respect of acts or omissions in their
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or as an
officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent of another enterprise if the
Indemnified Person was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company

Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other Applicable
Law (in the case of non-Delaware entities) or provided under the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws, any indemnification agreements and any other
governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date
hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

In the event of any threatened or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and
whether formal or informal (each, a " **Proceeding** ") to which an
Indemnified Person is, has been or becomes a party or with respect to which an
Indemnified Person is, has been or becomes otherwise involved (including as a
witness), arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in
part to, the fact that the Indemnified Person is or was an officer or director
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is or was serving at the request
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, employee,
fiduciary or agent of another enterprise (including any Proceeding arising out

(including attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred by each Indemnified
Person in connection with and prior to the final disposition of such
Proceedings, such fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements) to be advanced within twenty (20) days of receipt by Parent
from the Indemnified Person of a request therefor, _provided_ such Indemnified
Person provides a written affirmation of such Indemnified Persons good faith
belief that he or she has met all applicable standards of conduct applicable
to indemnification and an undertaking to repay such advance if it is
ultimately determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification
under this _Section 7.04(a)_ or otherwise.

 



 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions
regarding (i) elimination of liability of directors and managers, (ii)
indemnification of officers, directors and managers, and (iii) advancement of
expenses, in each case, for periods prior to and including the Effective Time,
that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the
corresponding provisions in the Companys governing documents in existence on
the date of this Agreement. The indemnification agreements with the Companys
directors and officers that survive the Merger shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect all provisions in the certificate of incorporation,
bylaws and other governing documents of the Companys Subsidiaries regarding
(i) elimination of liability of directors and managers, (ii) indemnification
of officers, directors and managers, and (iii) advancement of expenses, in
each case, that are no less advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than
the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or, if the Company is
unable to or does not, Parent shall and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
as of the Effective Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-
cancellable extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of
the Companys existing directors and officers insurance policies and the
Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " **D
andO Insurance**"), in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of
six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time, from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of

 



      
 

 



 

liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies with respect to any actual or alleged error,
misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ that
neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall purchase such a "tail"
policy for a premium amount for any one year in excess of 300% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance (the " **Tail Cap**
") without the prior written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the premiums of such "tail" policy exceed the Tail Cap, the Company, after
prior consultation with Parent, may obtain such a "tail" policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Tail Cap. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, either (i) continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time,
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof or (ii) purchase from the Companys current
insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence a premium
amount for any one year in excess of the Tail Cap; and _provided_ , _further,_
that if the premiums of such insurance coverage with respect to any policy
year exceed the Tail Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Tail Cap.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Person
is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved (including as a
witness) in any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall continue in effect until the final
disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(f) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section 7.04_.

 



 

(g) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.04_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other

 



      
 

 



 

governing documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under Delaware
Law or any other Applicable Law (in the case of non-Delaware entities) under
any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person and
his or her heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.05. _ Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to, provide to each Company Employee who is employed immediately prior to the
Closing and who becomes an employee of Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries upon the Closing (each such individual, a " **Continuing
Employee** ") employee benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate
than the level of such employee benefits provided to such employees on the
date hereof.

 



 

(b) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent shall
maintain the employee severance protections set forth in _Section 7.05(b)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter, which shall be in lieu of any Parent severance
plans or benefits.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to, cause each Parent Employee Plan to (i) recognize the
pre-Closing service of participating Continuing Employees with the Company for
all purposes of vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement (but not for
purposes of pension benefit accrual), except to the extent such service credit
would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) waive any
pre-existing condition limitations for participating Continuing Employees and
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to provide credit to each
participating Continuing Employee under the applicable Parent Employee Plan
for amounts paid by the Continuing Employee prior to the Closing during the
year in which the Closing occurs under any analogous Company Employee Plan
during the same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co-payments and
out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the terms of such Parent Employee Plan.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to continue to credit
under any applicable Parent Employee Plans each Continuing Employee for all
vacation and personal holiday pay that such Continuing Employee is entitled to
use but has not used as of the Closing.

 



 

(e) Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge that (i) the Merger will
constitute a "Change in Control" (or concept of similar import) under the
Company Employee Plans and (ii) as a result of the Merger, the individuals
identified in Section 7.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed
to have experienced a "Good Reason" event (or concept of similar import), as
applicable, for all purposes under the Company Employee Plans.

 



 

(f) The Company shall pay annual cash bonuses to executive officers and other
key corporate office employees covered by the Carmike Annual Executive Bonus
Program (the " **Executive Plan** ") for the period ending December 31, 2016
as follows: (i) if the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

occurs prior to December 31, 2016, annual cash bonuses will be paid at the
target performance level on a pro-rata basis, (ii) if the Closing occurs on or
after December 31, 2016 and if the compensation committee of the Companys
Board of Directors (the " **Compensation Committee** ") has certified the
performance results prior to Closing, annual cash bonuses will be paid based
on actual achieved performance, and (iii) if the Closing occurs on or after
December 31, 2016 and if the Compensation Committee has not certified the
performance results prior to Closing, annual cash bonuses will be paid at the
target performance level. The Company shall pay annual cash bonuses to
individuals not covered by the Executive Plan in accordance with the terms of
the applicable bonus plan. The Company shall pay the annual cash bonuses that
are contemplated by this _Section 7.05(f)_ on the earlier of (A) immediately
prior to the Closing and (B) the date that is consistent with the Companys
past practices. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the Parties
that the annual cash bonuses contemplated by this _Section 7.05(f)_ are in
addition to the severance arrangements set forth on _Section 4.19(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 7.05_, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person, including any Continuing Employee, any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 7.05_ shall constitute an
amendment of, or an undertaking to amend, any Company Employee Plan or Parent
Employee Plan.

 



 

Section 7.06. _ No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 4_, each of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary acknowledges and agrees that no other representation or
warranty of any kind whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, is
made or shall be deemed to have been made by or on behalf of the Company or
its Subsidiaries with respect to their respective businesses, affairs, assets,
liabilities, financial conditions, results of operations or prospects or with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of any other information provided or
made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary by or on behalf of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, and the Company hereby disclaims any such representation
or warranty, whether by or on behalf of the Company, and notwithstanding the
delivery or disclosure to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives or Affiliates of any
documentation or other information by the Company or any of its
Representatives with respect to any one or more of the foregoing. Neither the
Company nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates will have or be subject
to any liability or obligation to Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any other
Person resulting from the distribution in written or verbal communications to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary of any such information, including any
information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made
available to Parent or to Merger Subsidiary in online "data rooms,"
confidential information memoranda or management interviews and presentations.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Nothing set forth in this
_Section 8.01_ limits, modifies, waives, amends or otherwise adversely
affects (A) the Companys rights under _Section 6.04_ or (B) any Partys

**DOJ** ") or any other Governmental Authority under the HSR Act or any other
Applicable Laws when practicable and advisable as mutually agreed by the
Parties and (iv) subject to _Section 8.01(e)_, cooperate in good faith with
the other Party in obtaining all Approvals required under Applicable Laws and

such Approval.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Parent and the Company shall coordinate with respect to the overall
strategy relating to the Antitrust Laws, including with respect to any
filings, notifications, submissions and communications with or to any
antitrust regulatory authority; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) subject to
the other provisions of this _Section 8.01_, Parent shall make the final
determination as to the appropriate course of action and (y) neither Parent
nor the Company shall be constrained from complying with Applicable Law. Each
Party shall (i) consult and cooperate with the other Party regarding, allow
the other Party to have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance prior to

briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of
either Party in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust
Laws, (ii) promptly furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence,
filings and written communications between them and their Affiliates and their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and any such Governmental
Authority or its respective staff on the other hand, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) give
the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person
meetings, and to the extent reasonably practicable, substantive telephone
calls with the DOJ, the FTC or any other Governmental Authority (to the extent
permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such Governmental Authority) with respect to
the subject matter of this _Section 8.01_ (including with respect to any of
the actions referred to _in Section 8.01(d)_ and _Section 8.01(e)_) and, if
the other Party is prohibited by Applicable Laws or by the DOJ, the FTC or
such Governmental Authority from attending and participating in any such
meetings or calls, keep the other Party reasonably apprised with respect
thereto to the extent permitted under Applicable Law. Each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all information required for
any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Applicable Law in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Party
will directly or indirectly extend any waiting period under the HSR Act or
enter into any agreement with a Governmental Authority related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except with the
prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding any provisions of this
_Section 8.01_ to the contrary, (A) materials provided to the other Party
pursuant to this _Section 8.01_ may be redacted (x) to remove references
concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries,
(y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary
to address privilege or confidentiality concerns and (B) each Party shall have
the right to designate any information as attorneys eyes only.

 



 

(d) In connection with and without limiting _Section 8.01(a)_, but subject to
_Section 8.01(e)_, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration or
termination of the waiting periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in any event prior to
the End Date), including using its reasonable best efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority under the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign
statues, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or judicial
doctrines or other laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " **Antitrust Laws** "). In

 



      
 

 



 

connection therewith and subject to _Section 8.01(e)_, if any Proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Applicable Laws, each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
vigorously contest and resist any such Proceeding (through negotiation,
litigation or otherwise), including any administrative or judicial action, and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent (each an
" **Order** "), that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or
restricts the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and
judicial appeal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company
shall not, without the written consent of Parent, agree to or effect any
Antitrust Action required by any Governmental Authority. If necessary to avoid
the commencement of any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority challenging
the transactions under this Agreement under any Applicable Laws, or if already
commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order
that would prohibit, prevent or restrict the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then, subject to the penultimate sentence of
this _Section 8.01(e)_, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
offer, negotiate and agree to, and shall effect, any Antitrust Action with
respect to Parents, the Companys or their respective Affiliates businesses
or assets; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to agree to or effect
any Antitrust Actions with respect to any of Parents, the Companys or their
respective Affiliates businesses or assets if such Antitrust Actions have a
Regulatory Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall not be required to
agree to or effect any Antitrust Action with respect to the Company, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates businesses or assets unless such actions
are conditioned upon the occurrence of the Closing or are effective on or
after the Closing, and no Party shall be required to waive any of the
conditions set forth in _Article 9_ as they apply to such Party. None of the
actions taken or proposed to be taken pursuant to this _Section 8.01(e)_
shall be deemed to result in a breach of the representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement or shall be considered for purposes of determining
whether a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect
has occurred.

 



 

(f) (i) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
offer, negotiate and agree to, the sale of the Proscribed Theatres; and (ii)
Parent shall, and the Company shall reasonably cooperate to, effect the sale
of the Proscribed Theatres simultaneously with the Closing on the terms
negotiated by Parent; _provided_ that (A) neither Parent nor the Company shall
be constrained from complying with Applicable Law; and (B) the sale of the
Proscribed Theatres is contingent on the Closing.

 



 

Section 8.02. _ Certain Filings_.

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another (i) in connection
with the preparation of the Company Proxy Statement, (ii) in determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from Parties to any material contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings, furnishing
information required in

 



      
 

 



 

connection therewith or with the Company Proxy Statement and seeking timely to
obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Company Proxy Statement. The Company shall mail or deliver the Company Proxy
Statement to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after
receipt of confirmation from the SEC that it has no further comments to the
Company Proxy Statement. Parent shall furnish to the Company all information
as may be reasonably requested by the Company in connection with any such
action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Company Proxy
Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide the other Party with copies of any written
comments and advise the other Party of any oral comments with respect to the
Company Proxy Statement received by the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or
supplement to the Company Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the SEC
and if required, the Company shall disseminate to the Companys stockholders,
as promptly as reasonably practicable, any amendment of or supplement to the
Company Proxy Statement required as a result of such comments or as otherwise
required by Applicable Law. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
Company Proxy Statement, or response to SEC comments with respect thereto,
will be made by Parent or the Company, as applicable, without the others
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take any
other action required to be taken under the 1934 Act, Delaware Law and the
rules of NASDAQ and the NYSE, in connection with the filing and distribution
of the Company Proxy Statement and the solicitation of proxies from the
Companys stockholders thereunder.

 



 

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to
Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, officers or
directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in
an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement, so that such
documents would not include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state

Section 8.03. _ Parent Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to, obtain and consummate the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters (including the "market flex" provisions in any Debt
Commitment Letter or Fee Letter) including using its reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate and enter into the Debt Financing Documents on such terms and
conditions (as such terms may be modified or adjusted in accordance with (x)
the terms of, and within the limits of any such "market flex" provisions and
(y) this _Section 8.03_), (ii) if all of the conditions to the Closing
contained in Article 9 are satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing or will be
satisfied or

 



      
 

 



 

waived upon funding) and the Marketing Period has ended, satisfy on a timely
basis (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary contained in the Debt Commitment Letters that are within its or
their control, (iii) cause the lenders party to the Debt Commitment Letters to
fund at the Closing the full amount of the Financing required to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if all of the conditions to
the Closing contained in Article 9 are satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived at the Closing or
will be satisfied or waived upon funding) and (iv) maintain in effect and
comply with its obligations under (x) the Debt Commitment Letters and (y) to
the extent necessary to obtain and consummate the Financing, the Existing
Credit Facility. Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy, under the Debt Commitment
Letters or the Existing Credit Facility without the prior written consent of
the Company; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing Parent shall be
permitted to amend the Debt Commitment Letters (A) to add purchasers, lenders,
lead arrangers, book-runners, syndication agents or similar entities who had
not executed any Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement
provided, further, that no such addition shall relieve the original Lenders of
their obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters prior to the initial
funding of the Financing, except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
in respect of the "Additional Initial Lenders" (as defined thereunder), or (B)
so long as such amendments or modifications do not, or could not be reasonably
expected to, materially delay, prevent or adversely affect the Closing or the
consummation of the Financing. Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, as the
same shall become due and payable, all fees and other amounts payable under
the Debt Commitment Letters, Fee Letters and the Debt Financing Documents as
required for funding of the full amount of the Financing at Closing. Upon any
amendment, supplement or modification of the Debt Commitment Letters or the
Existing Credit Facility (as the case may be) in accordance with this _Section
8.03_, Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and the term "Debt
Commitment Letters" shall mean the Debt Commitment Letters as so amended,
supplemented or modified and the term "Existing Credit Facility" shall mean
the Existing Credit Facility as so amended, supplemented or modified.

 



 

(b) If all or any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions set forth therein (including the "market flex" provisions in
any Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter), Parent shall promptly notify the
Company, and Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain substitute financing (on terms and
conditions that are not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions as set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letters, taking into account any "market flex" provisions
in any Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter) sufficient to enable Parent to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with their terms (the " **Substitute Financing** ") and obtain a
new commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Financing and,
promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete and
correct copies of the new commitment letter and fee letter (redacted in the
manner required thereby). Such Substitute Financing shall be deemed to be a
part of the "Financing" and any commitment letter and fee letter for such
Substitute Financing shall be deemed a "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Fee
Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt written notice:
(i) of any material breach or default under the Debt Commitment Letter by any
party thereto or an

 



      
 

 



 

Event of Default as defined in and under the Existing Credit Facility, (ii) of
the receipt of any written notice from any party to any Debt Commitment Letter
with respect to any actual or threatened material breach, default, withdrawal,
termination or repudiation of any provisions of any Debt Commitment Letter by
such party, (iii) of the receipt of any written notice from any party to the
Existing Credit Facility with respect to any Event of Default as defined in
and under the Existing Credit Facility, and (iv) if for any reason Parent or
Merger Subsidiary believes in good faith that it will not be able to timely
obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the manner or from
the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters. Promptly following
any reasonable written request by the Company therefor, Parent shall provide
the Company any information reasonably requested by the Company in writing
relating to any circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the
Financing (or Substitute Financing obtained in accordance with _Section
8.03(b)_), including all material activity and timing considerations.

reimbursement as provided in clause (e) below, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries, officers and employees, and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its advisors and representatives (including legal and
accounting) to, cooperate, as may be reasonably requested, with Parents

other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 11.03. _ Amendments and Waivers_.

 



 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each Party against whom the waiver is to be

approval of the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law without such
approval having first been obtained.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies

remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) In the event that any party seeks an amendment or waiver to this _Section
11.03_ or _Section 11.06_, _Section 11.07_, _Section 11.08_, _Section
11.09_, or _Section 11.15_, that is adverse to any Financing Source, the
prior written consent of the adversely affected Financing Source shall be

Section 11.04. _ Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost
or expense.

 



 

(b)

 



 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) (the " **Termination Fee** ")
within three Business Days after such termination.

 



 

(ii) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available
funds the Termination Fee concurrently with such termination.

 



 

(iii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(i)_ (other than in circumstances in which Parent is
required to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
11.04(b)(iv)_ upon such termination) or _Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ and at the
time of termination all conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth
in _Article 9_, other than the condition set forth in _Section 9.01(a)_,
have been satisfied or waived, (B) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been
made (or, in the case of termination by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_, publicly announced) after the date of this Agreement
and not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting and (C) within
eighteen (18) months following the date of such termination, the Company or
any Subsidiary enters into a definitive agreement with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal (which is thereafter consummated) or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
clause (C), each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to
Parent in immediately available funds the Termination Fee upon the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(iv) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(ii)_, (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(ii)_ due to a material breach by Parent of _Section 8.01_, which
breach results in the conditions set forth in either _Section 9.01(b)_ or
_Section 9.01(c)_ being incapable of being satisfied or (iii) by the Company
or Parent pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ (in the case of termination by
Parent, only under circumstances in which the Company has a concurrent right
to terminate pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_) and as of the End Date, (A)
one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01(b)_ or _Section
9.01(c)_ has not been satisfied, including as a result of Parent not agreeing
to take or not taking any Antitrust Actions that have a Regulatory Material
Adverse Effect and (B) all of the other conditions set forth in _Article 9_
have been satisfied (other than any such conditions which by their nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date but subject to such conditions
being capable of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of
termination), then Parent will, within three Business Days following any such
termination, pay to the Company or its designee in cash by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account designated by the

 



      
 

 



 

Company a termination fee in an amount equal to Fifty Million Dollars
($50,000,000) (the " **Regulatory Termination Fee** ").

 



 

(c) In no event shall more than one Termination Fee or Regulatory Termination
Fee be payable.

 



 

(d) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
11.04_ are an integral part of this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay
any applicable amount when due pursuant to this _Section 11.04_, and, in
order to obtain such payment, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Company, as
applicable, commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company or
Parent, as applicable, for the fee set forth in this _Section 11.04_ or any
portion of such fee, then (i) in the case of the Termination Fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent and (ii) in the case of the Regulatory Termination Fee,
Parent shall pay to the Company, its reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence or
in the case of fraud, Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that, upon any
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the Termination Fee is
payable by the Company pursuant to this Section and such Termination Fee is
paid in full, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be precluded from any other
remedy against the Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and neither
Parent nor Merger Subsidiary shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or
damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages,
against the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members,
stockholders or Affiliates or their respective Representatives in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set
forth in the first sentence or in the case of fraud, the Company agrees that,
upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances where the
Regulatory Termination Fee is payable by Parent pursuant to this Section and
such Regulatory Termination Fee is paid in full, the Company shall be
precluded from any other remedy against Parent or Merger Subsidiary, at law or
in equity or otherwise, and the Company shall not seek to obtain any recovery,
judgment, or damages of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or
punitive damages, against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members, stockholders or Affiliates or their respective
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 11.05. _ Disclosure Letter and SEC Document References_. The Parties
agree that any reference in a particular Section of either the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an
exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant
Party that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and
(b) any other representations and warranties of such Party that are contained
in this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure is set forth with such
specificity that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that
such disclosure is applicable to such Sections. The mere inclusion of an item
in either the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter as an
exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission
that such item represents a material

 



      
 

 



 

exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, and no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns, other than: (i) with
respect to the provisions of _Section 7.04_ which shall inure to the benefit
of the persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-

of the former holders of shares of Company Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,

Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance Shares and
Company Restricted Stock Units to receive the payments contemplated by the
applicable provisions of _Section 2.05_, in each case, at the Effective Time

_however_ , that (A) Parent may, without the consent of the Company, assign or
otherwise transfer its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any of
its Financing Sources for purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning as collateral in respect of the Financing and any
refinancings, extensions, refundings or renewals thereof; _provided_ that such
assignment or transfer shall not in any way affect Parents obligations and
liabilities under this Agreement and (B) each Financing Source is an express
third party beneficiary of _Section 11.03_, _Section 11.06_, _Section
11.07_, _Section 11.08_, _Section 11.09_ or _Section 11.15_. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.

 



 

(b) No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other Parties.

 



 

Section 11.07. _ Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and

otherwise) against any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the financings
contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the law of the State of New York (without regard to the
conflicts of law provisions thereof); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the
interpretation of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect and
whether there shall have occurred a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b)

(c) the determination of whether the representations made by the Company are
accurate and whether as a result of any inaccuracy of any such representations
Parent has the right to terminate its obligations, or has the right not to
consummate the Merger, under this Agreement, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the domestic laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law.

of the State of New York located in New York County, and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably
waives to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any
such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,

any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a

Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other Parties,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no Party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement by
electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to
bind the Parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.12. _ Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, among the Parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.13. _ Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original

Section 11.14. _ Specific Performance_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
the terms hereof (and, more specifically, that irreparable damage would occur
if the Merger were not consummated and the Companys stockholders and holders
of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance
Shares and Company Restricted Stock Units did not receive the aggregate Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms but subject to the conditions of
this Agreement) and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the Parties
obligation to consummate the Merger and Parents obligation to pay, and

 



      
 

 



 

the Companys stockholders and holders of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares, Company Performance Shares and Company Restricted Stock
Units right to receive, the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) in

court, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and the Parties further waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond or proof of actual damages in connection with any such
remedy. If, prior to the End Date, any Party brings an action to enforce

another Party, the End Date shall automatically be extended by (a) the amount
of time during which such action is pending, plus twenty Business Days, or (b)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

 



 

Section 11.15. _ Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that none of
the Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or

by the Financing Sources and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of

ARTICLE 6

 



 

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

 



 

Section 6.1 The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation) by
reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of the Corporation serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him
in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The
termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of
itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in
a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceedings, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.

 



 

Section 6.2 The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party
or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in
its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was a director or officer of
the Corporation serving at the request of the Corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of

      
 

 



 

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of
such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation;
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or
matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the
Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery or the
court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon
application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to
indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery or such other court
shall deem proper.

 



 

Section 6.3 Any indemnification under this Article 6 (unless ordered by a
court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific
case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer,
employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.1 or Section 6.2 of this
Article 6, as the case may be. Such determination shall be made (i) by the
Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who
were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum
is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable a quorum of disinterested directors
so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the
stockholders. To the extent, however, that a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in
defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of
any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses
(including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific
case.

 



 

Section 6.4 For purposes of any determination under this Article 6, a person
shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, or,
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable
cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the
records or books of account of the Corporation or another enterprise, or on
information supplied to him by the officers of the Corporation or another
enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel
for the Corporation or another enterprise or on information or records given
or reports made to the Corporation or another enterprise by an independent
certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with
reasonable care by the Corporation or another enterprise. The term "another
enterprise" as used in this Section 6.4 shall mean any other corporation or
any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent. The provisions of this
Section 6.4 shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the
circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Sections 6.1 or 6.2 of this Article 6, as the
case may be.

 



 

Section 6.5 Notwithstanding any contrary determination in the specific case
under Section 6.3 of this Article 6, and notwithstanding the absence of any
determination thereunder, any director, officer, employee or agent may apply
to any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware for
indemnification to the extent otherwise permissible under Sections 6.1 and 6.2
of this Article 6\. The basis of such indemnification by a court shall be a
determination by

      
 

 



 

such court that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is
proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standards of
conduct set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2 of this Article 6, as the case may be.
Neither a contrary determination in the specific case under Section 6.3 of
this Article 6 nor the absence of any determination thereunder shall be a
defense to such application or create a presumption that the director,
officer, employee or agent seeking indemnification has not met any applicable
standard of conduct. Notice of any application for indemnification pursuant to
this Section 6.5 shall be given to the Corporation promptly upon the filing of
such application. If successful, in whole or in part, the director, officer,
employee or agent seeking indemnification shall also be entitled to be paid
the expense of prosecuting such application.

 



 

Section 6.6 Expenses incurred by a director or officer in defending or
investigating a threatened or pending action, suit or proceeding shall be paid
by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding, including in advance of the conduct determination described in
Section 6.3 hereof, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall
ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation as authorized in this Article 6.

 



 

Section 6.7 The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or
granted pursuant to this Article 6 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which a person seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses
may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement, contract, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of
any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his
official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such
office, it being the policy of the Corporation that indemnification of the
persons specified in Section 6.1 and 6.2 of this Article 6 shall be made to
the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Article 6 shall
not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not
specified in Section 6.1 or 6.2 of this Article 6 but whom the Corporation has
the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.8 The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of
any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and incurred by
him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power or the obligation to indemnify him
against such liability under the provisions of this Article 6.

 



 

Section 6.9 For purposes of this Article 6, references to "the Corporation"
shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent
corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a
consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would
have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees
or agents, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such
constituent corporation, or is or was a director, officer, employee or agent
of such constituent corporation serving at the request of such constituent
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of

      
 

 



 

another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of
this Article 6 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he
would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate
existence had continued. For purposes of this Article 6, references to "fines"
shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an
employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the request of the
Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or
agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by,
such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit
plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to
have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation"
as referred to in this Article 6.

 



 

Section 6.10 The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Article 6 shall continue as to a person who has
ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the
benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

 



 

Section 6.11 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article 6 to the
contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which
shall be governed by Section 6.5 hereof), the Corporation shall not be
obligated to indemnify any director, officer, employee or agent in connection
with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such
proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 6.12 The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time
by the Board of Directors, provide rights to indemnification and to the
advancement of expenses to employees and agents of the Corporation similar to
those conferred in this Article 6 to directors and officers of the
Corporation.

 



 

Section 6.13 No amendment to or repeal of this Article 6 shall apply to or
have any effect on the rights of any person for or with respect to acts or
omissions of such person occurring prior to such amendment or repeal.
