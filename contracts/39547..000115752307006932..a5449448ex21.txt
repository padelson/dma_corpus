                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

     AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 17, 2007 (this "Agreement"),
by and among CaucusCom Ventures L.P., a British Virgin Islands limited
partnership ("Parent"), CaucusCom Mergerco Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Metromedia International
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company").

                              W I T N E S S E T H :

     WHEREAS, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein,
Merger Sub has agreed to commence a cash tender offer (such tender offer, as it
may be amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted by this
Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase any and all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common
Shares"), at a price of $1.80 per Common Share, net to the seller in cash (such
price, or any higher price as may be paid for Common Shares in the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, the "Common Per Share Amount");

     WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer and, as applicable, the Top-up
Option (as defined below) or the Company Stockholder Approval (as defined
below), Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with
the Company as the Surviving Corporation (as defined below), and (i) each Common
Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as
defined below) (other than (x) any Common Shares owned directly or indirectly by
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, which will be canceled with no consideration
issued in exchange therefor and (y) any Common Shares held by holders who comply
with the provisions of the DGCL regarding the right of stockholders to dissent
from the Merger and require appraisal of their shares) will be canceled and
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Common Per
Share Amount, without interest, and (ii) each share of 7.25% cumulative
convertible preferred stock of the Company, par value $1.00 per share
(collectively, the "Preferred Shares" and, together with the Common Shares, the
"Shares"), that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will remain outstanding as a Surviving Corporation Preferred Share (as
defined below) (other than Preferred Shares held by holders who comply with the
provisions of the DGCL regarding the right of stockholders to dissent from the
Merger and require appraisal of their Preferred Shares), all upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein;

     WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Company shall survive the Merger as a
subsidiary of Parent;

     WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors")
has (i) determined that it is advisable for the Company to enter into this
Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and (iii) determined to recommend that the holders of Common Shares
accept the Offer and tender their Common Shares to Merger Sub and, to the extent
applicable, adopt this Agreement;

<PAGE>


     WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub have
approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and Merger Sub,
respectively, to enter into the transactions contemplated hereby;

     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent, Merger Sub and certain stockholders of the Company are entering into
certain Tender and Support Agreements, each dated as of the date hereof, in
connection with the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby; and

     WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein in
connection with this Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                         THE TENDER OFFER AND THE MERGER

     Section 1.1 The Offer.

     (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with Section 6.1, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within
five (5) Business Days, following the execution of this Agreement (or such other
later date as the parties may mutually agree in writing), (i) Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all issued and outstanding Common
Shares at the Common Per Share Amount. The Common Per Share Amount shall be net
to the seller in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable taxes.
Subject to Section 1.1(b), the obligations of Merger Sub to accept for payment
and pay for any Common Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject to
only those conditions set forth in Annex I (the "Tender Offer Conditions"). The
Company agrees that no Common Shares held by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than any Common Shares held on behalf of third parties) will
be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

     (b) Parent on behalf of itself and Merger Sub expressly reserves the right
from time to time, subject to Sections 1.1(c) and (d), to waive any Tender Offer
Condition or increase the Common Per Share Amount; provided, however, that
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to, (i) decrease the Common Per Share Amount
or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the
number of Common Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend or
waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in Annex I, the
"Original Minimum Condition"), except that Merger Sub may on a single occasion
decrease the Minimum Condition to a level not less than (x) 56,182,474 Common
Shares plus (y) 50% of the total number of Common Shares, if any, issued or
issuable (solely in the case of Common Shares issuable, such Common Shares
issuable but not yet issued in response to any notice, duly and validly given
(and not subsequently withdrawn) by a holder to the Company on or prior to the
Expiration Date, of election to exercise a Company Stock Option or Warrant or to
convert Preferred Shares) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Expiration Date (the "Lowered Minimum Condition"); (iv) impose additional
conditions to the Offer or (v) make any change in the Offer that would require
an extension or delay of the then current Expiration Date (other than an
increase in the Common Per Share Amount or a one-time decrease in the Original
Minimum Condition to an amount not less than the Lowered Minimum Condition).

                                       2
<PAGE>


     (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, but after affording the
Company reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, Parent and Merger
Sub shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC, with respect to the Offer, a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") that shall contain the Offer, together
with a related letter of transmittal, summary advertisement and other ancillary
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, and all
deliveries, mailings and telephonic notices required by Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, the "Offer Documents") that will comply in all material respects
with the provisions of all applicable Federal and other securities laws. Parent
and Merger Sub further agree to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of
Common Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Federal and other
securities laws. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees promptly to
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and Parent and Merger Sub shall, and Parent further agrees to cause
Merger Sub to, take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC, and to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of
Common Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Federal and other
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any Offer Documents (including each
amendment or supplement thereto) before they are filed with the SEC. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, and Parent agrees to cause Merger Sub to, provide the Company
with (in writing, if written), and to consult with the Company regarding, any
comments (written or oral) that may be received by Parent, Merger Sub or their
counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such written and
oral comments and proposed responses.

     (d) The Offer shall provide for an initial expiration date on the 20th
Business Day following (and including the day of) the commencement of the Offer
(such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is
extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
"Expiration Date"). Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and Parent agrees that it
shall cause Merger Sub not to, terminate or withdraw the Offer other than in
connection with the effective termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 6.1 hereof. So long as this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant
to Section 6.1, if at any scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Tender Offer
Conditions (including the Original Minimum Condition or the Lowered Minimum
Condition, as applicable) shall not have been satisfied or waived, (i) Parent
shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer at any time and from time
to time, at the request of the Company, until such time as such Tender Offer
Conditions are satisfied or waived, this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 6.1 or it becomes reasonably apparent that such Tender Offer Conditions
are not reasonably capable of being satisfied by the End Date; provided,
however, that any extension shall be in increments of not more than five (5)
Business Days; and provided, further, that in no event shall such extensions
exceed an aggregate of twenty (20) Business Days beyond the original Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of Parent, and (ii) Parent and Merger Sub
may, without the consent of the Company, further extend the Offer beyond the
applicable Expiration Date until such time as such Tender Offer Conditions are
satisfied or waived, in increments of not more than five (5) Business Days,
provided that such extensions shall not in the aggregate exceed sixty-five (65)
Business Days (less the aggregate period of any extensions pursuant to clause
(i) of this sentence) without the prior written consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as expressly provided in Section 1.1(b)
above, Parent shall not, and shall cause Merger Sub not to, extend the Offer if
all of the Tender Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived and it is
permitted under applicable Law to accept for payment and pay for Common Shares
tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn; provided, however, that if (i)
Parent or Merger Sub decreases the Original Minimum Condition to an amount not
less than the Lowered Minimum Condition in accordance with clause (iii) of
Section 1.1(b), (ii) following such change to the Minimum Condition, all of the
Tender Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived and (iii) all Common Shares
tendered in the Offer and not validly withdrawn have been accepted for payment
by Merger Sub and the total number of Common Shares thereby acquired by Merger
Sub is less than the Original Minimum Condition, then Parent shall, and shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for an aggregate period of not less than
ten (10) or more than twenty (20) Business Days as a "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with Section 6.1, (x) Parent shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to,
extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation
or position of the SEC or its staff applicable to the Offer and (y) the offering
period of the Offer shall be tolled for and during any period that a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued or
entered any temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction or similar
order or legal restraint or prohibition that remains in effect and that enjoins
or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer, and the offering period of the
Offer shall be extended by a number of days equal to the number of days that any
such temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction or similar order or
legal restraint or prohibition remains in effect. Nothing contained in this
Section 1.1(d) shall affect any termination rights in Article VI.

                                       3

     (e) Subject solely to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent and Merger Sub
of the Tender Offer Conditions in accordance with Section 1.1(b), as soon as
practicable after the applicable Expiration Date, (i) Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay for all Common
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the date of
such acceptance for payment, the "Acceptance Date"). Parent shall provide or
cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to
purchase any Common Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

     Section 1.2 Company Action.

     (a) The Board of Directors, at a duly called and held meeting, has adopted
resolutions: (i) determining that the terms of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair and declaring it
advisable to enter into this Agreement; (ii) approving the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger; (iii) approving the
Recommendation; (iv) rendering the limitations on business combinations
contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and (v) electing that
the Offer and the Merger, to the extent of the Board of Directors' power and
authority and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, not be subject to any
Takeover Laws that may purport to be applicable to this Agreement.

<PAGE>


     (b) As promptly as practicable following the filing of the Schedule TO with
the SEC pursuant to Section 1.1(c), the Company shall file with the SEC, with
respect to the Schedule TO, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, a "Schedule 14D-9")
that will comply in all material respects with the provisions of all applicable
Federal securities laws. The Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company
reasonably promptly after the commencement of the Offer as required by Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. To the extent practicable, the Company
shall cooperate with Parent and Merger Sub in mailing or otherwise disseminating
the Schedule 14D-9 with the appropriate Offer Documents to the holders of Common
Shares. Subject to any Change of Recommendation in accordance with this
Agreement, the Schedule 14D-9 relating to the Offer shall contain the
Recommendation. The Company agrees to (i) reasonably promptly correct the
Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it may become false or misleading in
any material respect (and each of Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to written
information supplied by it specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall
promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of such information and
shall cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such information),
(ii) supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any
information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so
corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company's stockholders to the extent required by applicable Federal securities
laws. Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 (and any corrections or
supplements thereto) before it is filed with the SEC. The Company shall provide
Parent and Merger Sub (in writing, if written), and consult with Parent and
Merger Sub regarding, any comments (written or oral) the Company or its counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 (and
any corrections or supplements thereto) as promptly as practicable after receipt
of such comments. Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral comments and proposed
responses.

     (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, reasonably promptly
following execution of this Agreement, furnish Parent with (i) mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Common Shares,
non-objecting beneficial owners list and security position listings of Common
Shares held in stock depositories, each as of the most recent practicable date,
and (ii) such additional available information, including updated lists of
stockholders, mailing labels, security position listings and computer files, and
such other information and assistance as Merger Sub or its agents may reasonably
request for the purpose of communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of Common Shares. Subject to the requirements of applicable Laws, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Parent, Merger Sub and
their affiliates, associates, agents and advisors, shall keep such information
confidential and use the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, should the Offer
terminate or if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the Company
all copies of such information then in their possession.

     Section 1.3 Directors.

     (a) Promptly upon the payment by Merger Sub for all Common Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer that represent at least a majority of the Common Shares
outstanding, and from time to time thereafter as Common Shares are acquired by
Merger Sub, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder, Parent shall be entitled to designate for
election or appointment to the Board of Directors such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, as will give Parent representation on the
Board of Directors equal to at least that number of directors that equals the
product of (x) the total authorized number of directors of the Company (giving
effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and
including (I) current directors serving as officers of the Company and (II) the
directors, if any, that the holders of the Preferred Shares, voting separately
as a class, are entitled to elect pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Certificate of
Designation) multiplied by (y) the percentage that the aggregate number of
Common Shares beneficially owned by Parent or any affiliate of Parent
(including, for purposes of this Section 1.3, any Common Shares that are
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer, but excluding any Common Shares held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) bears to the number of Common Shares
outstanding; provided, however, that, in the event that Parent's designees are
elected or appointed to the Board of Directors, (A) the Board of Directors shall
continue to include any directors that the holders of the Preferred Shares are
entitled to elect pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Certificate of Designation and
(B) until the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.7), the Board of Directors
shall have at least two directors (in addition to any directors entitled to be
elected pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Certificate of Designation, as provided
in clause (A) above) who are directors of the Company on the date hereof and who
are neither officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders, affiliates or
associates (within the meaning of the Federal securities laws) of Parent (each
such director, an "Independent Director" and, collectively, the "Independent
Directors"); and provided, further, that, (i) if there are in office fewer than
two Independent Directors, the Board of Directors will take all action necessary
to cause an individual designated by the remaining Independent Director, which
individual shall be neither an officer of the Company nor a designee,
stockholder, affiliate or associate of Parent, to fill such vacancy, and such
individual shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of this
Agreement, or (ii) if no Independent Directors remain in office, the other
directors shall designate two individuals, each of whom shall be neither an
officer of the Company nor a designee, stockholder, affiliate or associate of
Parent, to fill the vacancies, and each such individual shall be deemed to be an
Independent Director for purposes of this Agreement. At each such time, the
Company shall also, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable Law, cause
(A) each committee of the Board of Directors, (B) if requested by Parent, the
board of directors of each of the Company's Subsidiaries and (C) if requested by
Parent, each committee of the board of directors of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries, to include individuals designated by Parent and constituting the
same percentage of each such committee or board as Parent's designees constitute
of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that until the Effective Time each
committee of the Board of Directors shall have one member who is an Independent
Director; and provided, further, that the relevant percentage of Parent
designees to any Subsidiary board of directors shall be with respect to the
number of directors that the Company may appoint to such Subsidiary's board of
directors.

                                       6

     (b) The Company shall, upon request by Parent, subject to the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation, increase the size of the Board of Directors or
exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to secure the resignations of such
number of directors as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected
or appointed to the Board of Directors in accordance with this Section 1.3, and
shall cause Parent's designees to be so elected or appointed. Subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall take all action necessary pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.3 and shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 mailed to stockholders promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an
amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1, if Parent

affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

     (c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant to

termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by the Company of
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent
or Merger Sub hereunder, the waiver of any of the Company's rights hereunder, or
the taking of any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement

designees shall have the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company) and other advisors at the reasonable expense of
the Company as determined appropriate by these directors in connection with the
exercise of their duties as directors and shall have the authority to institute
any action on behalf of the Company to enforce the performance of this
Agreement.

     Section 1.4 Top-Up Option.

     (a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the
"Top-Up Option") to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Common Per Share
Amount, a number of Common Shares (the "Top-Up Option Shares") that, when added
to the number of Common Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option,
constitutes one Common Share more than 90% of the number of Common Shares that
will be issued and outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up
Option Shares. The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole or
in part, at any time on or after the Expiration Date and on or prior to the
fifth Business Day after the later of (x) the Expiration Date or (y) the
expiration of any subsequent offering period (the date on which the Top-Up
Option is exercised, the "Top-Up Option Exercise Date"); provided, however, that
the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise
of the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (i) neither any provision
of any applicable Law nor any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any
Governmental Entity shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (ii) the
issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require
approval of the Company's stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option, the number of Common Shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub
or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub will constitute one
Common Share more than 90% of the number of Common Shares that will be issued
and outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (iv)
Merger Sub has accepted for payment and paid for all Common Shares validly
tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn and (v) this Agreement has not been
terminated in accordance with Section 6.1; and provided, further, that the
aggregate number of Top-Up Option Shares may not exceed the aggregate number of
authorized but unissued Common Shares as of the Top-Up Option Exercise Date. The
parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares
is effected consistent with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an
applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the
Securities Act.

     (b) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with Section
1.4(a), Merger Sub shall give the Company a written notice of such exercise,
which notice shall set forth (i) the number of Common Shares that are expected
to be owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and
(ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option
Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub of the number of Common Shares then issued
and outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares to be purchased in
connection with such exercise. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to
be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued
to Parent or Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The
purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares attributable to the par value of
each of the Top-Up Option Shares shall be payable by Merger Sub to the Company
in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the Company, and the balance of the aggregate purchase price payable for the
Top-Up Option Shares may be paid by Merger Sub, at its option, either in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company or by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price of the
Top-Up Shares and bearing interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to
the Interest Rate. Any such promissory note shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note and
may be prepaid without premium or penalty, provided that it is understood that
such promissory note shall be canceled upon the Closing (as defined below).
Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that it will not offer
to sell or otherwise dispose of any Top-Up Option Shares acquired by it pursuant
to this Top-Up Option in violation of the Securities Act or prior to
consummation of the Merger.

     Section 1.5 The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, whereupon the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue its
corporate existence under Delaware law as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the "Surviving Corporation") and a subsidiary of Parent with all of its
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises.

     Section 1.6 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, 919 Third Avenue, New York,
New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date that shall be the third
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by
applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article V (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place, date
and time as the Company and Parent may agree in writing (the date on which the
Closing occurs being hereinafter referred to as the "Closing Date").

     Section 1.7 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at
the Closing and as soon as practicable following the satisfaction or wavier of
the conditions set forth in Article V, the Company and Merger Sub shall cause a
certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and
acknowledged and the Company shall cause the Certificate of Merger to be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section
251 of the DGCL (or, in the event a Short-Form Merger is effected pursuant to
Section 1.12, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL) and the Company and
Merger Sub shall make all other filings or recordings and take all such other
action required with respect to the Merger under the DGCL. The Merger will
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger has been duly
accepted for record with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such later date or time as may be agreed by the Company and Merger Sub in
writing and specified in the Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL
(the effective time of the Merger being hereinafter referred to as the
"Effective Time"), it being understood that the parties shall cause the
Effective Time to occur concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the
Closing.

     Section 1.8 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set

Corporation. Subject to Section 4.9, at the Effective Time, (i) the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety
to read as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be Metromedia International Group, Inc. and the provision in
the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub naming its incorporator shall be
omitted), provided that the Certificate of Designation shall continue to apply
to the Surviving Corporation and shall form part of the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, and (ii) the bylaws of the Company
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall constitute the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation, in each case, until thereafter amended in

                                       9

     Section 1.10 Directors. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub as of the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, in
accordance with the Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and
by-laws; provided, however, that the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall include any directors that the holders of the Preferred Shares
are entitled to elect pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Certificate of Designation.

     Section 1.11 Officers. The officers of the Company as of the Effective Time
shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall hold office
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

     Section 1.12 Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, following the Acceptance Date,
any subsequent offering period and the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up
Option Shares, as applicable, Parent or any direct or indirect Subsidiary of
Parent shall own at least 90% of the outstanding Common Shares, the parties
hereto shall, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article V, take all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to
become effective as soon as practicable thereafter, without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL (such
Merger, a "Short-Form Merger").

     Section 1.13 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the
holders of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

     (a) Conversion of Common Shares. Each Common Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than (x) Common Shares to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.13(b) and (y) any Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
automatically into, and shall thereafter represent, the right to receive in cash
an amount equal to the Common Per Share Amount (such amount, the "Merger
Consideration"). All Common Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 1.13(a) shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Common Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common Shares, other than
the right to receive (i) the Merger Consideration and (ii) any then unpaid
dividend or other distribution with respect to any such Common Shares that have
a record date prior to the Effective Time.

     (b) Parent and Merger Sub-Owned Common Shares. Each Common Share that is,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent or Merger Sub or (ii) held by the Company (in each case, other than any
such Common Shares held on behalf of third parties) (such Common Shares, the
"Canceled Shares") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be payable to the holder thereof in exchange for such
cancellation and retirement.

     (c) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and
become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation shall have the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares of common stock of Merger Sub so converted and shall
constitute the only shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
outstanding immediately following the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of common stock of Merger
Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation into which such shares of common stock of
Merger Sub were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

                                       10
<PAGE>


     (d) Dissenters' Rights. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, all Common Shares and Preferred Shares that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares)
and that are held by holders who have demanded and perfected their right to
dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such Common Shares or
Preferred Shares, as the case may be, in accordance with the DGCL and, as of the
Effective Time, have not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters' rights
(such Common Shares or Preferred Shares, as the case may be, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall, in the case of Common Shares, not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and in the case of the Preferred
Shares, not continue to be outstanding as Surviving Corporation Preferred
Shares, but in each case instead holders of such Dissenting Shares shall be
entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL; provided, however, that
if any holder of Common Shares or Preferred Shares who demands dissenters'
rights under the DGCL with respect to such holder's Common Shares or Preferred
Shares effectively withdraws or loses such rights (whether through failure to
perfect or otherwise) in accordance with the DGCL, then, as of the Effective
Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever occurs later, such holder's
Common Shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.13(a), without
interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates formerly
representing such Common Shares, and such holder's Preferred Shares shall
automatically continue to be outstanding as Surviving Corporation Preferred
Shares, with the rights and preferences set forth in the Certificate of
Designation (including with respect to all unpaid accumulated and accrued
dividends on such Preferred Shares). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
written notice of any notice of intent to demand appraisal of any Shares
received by the Company, withdrawals of such notices or demands, and any other
instruments relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal that are served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such notices and
demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of any
Shares or settle, or offer to agree to settle, any such demands.

     (e) Adjustments. If, at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the Common Shares shall occur as
a result of (i) any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), subdivision, combination, exchange or readjustment of the
Common Shares, (ii) any stock dividend or stock distribution with respect to the
Common Shares with a record date during such period, or (iii) any merger,
consolidation or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change (it being understood that nothing
herein shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect
to the Common Shares or any other securities of the Company that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement).

     Section 1.14 Exchange of Certificates.

     (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
U.S. bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act, pursuant
to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company, as a paying agent in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"),
to receive in trust for the benefit of holders of Common Shares the aggregate
Merger Consideration to which holders of Common Shares shall become entitled
pursuant to Section 1.13(a). On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent a cash amount in U.S.
dollars (such cash amount, the "Exchange Fund") sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration for all of the Common Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares). The
Paying Agent shall pay the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund in
accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

     (b) Payment Procedures.

          (i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, and in
     any event not later than the third Business Day following the Closing Date,
     Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each
     holder of record, as of the Effective Time, of a certificate or
     certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
     outstanding Common Shares (the "Certificates") or non-certificated
     outstanding Common Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares"),
     (A) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that
     delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates
     shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
     loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent) and (B)
     instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or
     effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
     exchange for the Merger Consideration. The form of the letter of
     transmittal and instructions shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and
     the Company.

          (ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
     in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, together with a
     letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance
     with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily
     be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates or
     Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and
     the Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to such holder, a check in an
     amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Common Shares represented
     by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits
     of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger
     Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
     upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
     thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
     Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
     Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due surrender of the
     Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly
     representing such Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent,
     accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
     and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

                                       12
<PAGE>


          (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Parent,
     Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be
     entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
     under this Agreement (whether pursuant to the Offer, the Merger or
     otherwise) to any holder of Shares such amounts as are required to be
     withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of any applicable Law
     relating to Taxes with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
     that any amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted
     amounts shall be paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in
     accordance with applicable Law and treated for all purposes of this
     Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
     which such deduction and withholding was made.

     (c) Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged for a
check in the proper amount pursuant to this Section 1.14.

     (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Common Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former
holders of Common Shares who have not surrendered their Common Shares in
accordance with this Section 1.14 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Common Shares.

     (e) No Liability. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or
any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Common Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

     (f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent (so long as such
directions do not impair the rights of the holders of Common Shares or the
ability of the Paying Agent to make timely payments as required hereby);
provided, however, that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; provided that no such investment
or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration or other amounts payable
pursuant to this Article I, and that Parent shall promptly provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, additional funds to the Paying Agent
in the amount of any shortfall in funds payable pursuant to this Article I. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the
Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 1.14(d).

                                       13

     (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the case of any Certificate
that has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in an amount equal to the number
of Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by the Merger Consideration.

     Section 1.15 Preferred Shares; Stock Options; Warrants; Restricted Stock.

     (a) Each Preferred Share that is not a Dissenting Share and is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
immediately following the Effective Time and shall automatically become one (1)
share of 7.25% cumulative convertible preferred stock of the Surviving
Corporation, having the rights and preferences set forth in the Certificate of
Designation (including with respect to all unpaid accumulated and accrued
dividends on such Preferred Shares) (a "Surviving Corporation Preferred Share").

     (b) Each option to purchase Common Shares (collectively, the "Company Stock
Options") granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the
Effective Time be canceled, and the holder of such Company Stock Option shall,
in full settlement of such Company Stock Option, receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash (such
aggregate cash amount, the "Option Consideration") equal to the product of (x)
the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per
share of such Company Stock Option multiplied by (y) the total number of Common
Shares subject to such Company Stock Option. If the exercise price per share of
any Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, then such Company Stock Option shall
be canceled at the Effective Time and shall be of no further force and effect,
and no consideration shall be payable in respect to such Company Stock Option.
The Surviving Corporation shall make the payments in respect of the Option
Consideration as promptly as practicable following the cancellation of the
Company Stock Options as contemplated by this Section 1.15(b) by checks payable
to the holders of such Company Stock Options. Upon written notice from the
Surviving Corporation, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to pay to the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Surviving Corporation's
payment obligation under this Section 1.15(b) as such amounts are paid (such
amount to be set forth in such written notice).

     (c) Each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall at the Effective Time be canceled, and the
holder of such Warrant shall, in full settlement of such Warrant, receive from
the Surviving Corporation an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax)
in cash (such aggregate cash amount, the "Warrant Consideration") equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Warrant multiplied by (y) the total number of Common
Shares subject to such Warrant. If the exercise price per share of any Warrant
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, then such Warrant shall be canceled at the Effective Time and
shall be of no further force and effect, and no consideration shall be payable
in respect to such Warrant. The Surviving Corporation shall make the payments in
respect of the Warrant Consideration, if any, as promptly as practicable
following the cancellation of the Warrants as contemplated by this Section
1.15(c) by checks payable to the holders of such Warrants. Upon written notice
from the Surviving Corporation, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to pay to the
Surviving Corporation an amount in cash sufficient to fund the Surviving
Corporation's payment obligation under this Section 1.15(c), if any, as such
amounts are paid (such amount to be set forth in such written notice).

                                       14
<PAGE>


     (d) In connection with the Merger, as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any restrictions with respect to outstanding restricted Common Shares
shall terminate or lapse. Upon the termination or lapse of such restrictions,
such Common Shares shall be outstanding Common Shares and shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.13(a) of this Agreement.

     (e) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause to
be taken all action as may reasonably be required to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 1.15.

     Section 1.16 Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall determine or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of Merger Sub or the Company or to otherwise carry out this
Agreement, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub or
the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of Merger Sub or the Company, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

     Except as (a) specifically disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed
with the SEC prior to the date hereof (excluding any disclosures set forth in
any risk factor disclosure contained in any such Company SEC Document under the
heading "Risks Associated with the Company" or forward looking statements
contained therein) or (b) otherwise disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered
by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the "Company Disclosure Letter), the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

     Section 2.1 Organization, Qualification, etc.

     (a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation or other form
of legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, validly
existing or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified
to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction (to the extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected, individually or
in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to

and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction (to the
extent such concepts exist in such jurisdictions) where the ownership, leasing
or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly
existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority,
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent
or materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
timely consummate the Merger, the Offer and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect"). Parent has heretofore
made available to the Company accurate and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Parent and Merger Sub, as currently in effect, and
each such instrument is in full force and effect.

     Section 3.2 Capitalization and Operations of Merger Sub. The authorized
capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, all of which are duly authorized, validly issued and
outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable, and none of the outstanding
securities of Merger Sub were issued in violation of any Federal or state
securities Laws or any preemptive rights, purchase options, call rights, rights
of first refusal or any similar rights. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent or a direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent and free and clear of all
Liens. Merger Sub has outstanding no options, warrants, rights or any other
agreements, arrangements or commitments pursuant to which any Person other than
Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed
solely for the purposes of engaging in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has,
and prior to the Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations
of any nature other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this
Agreement and the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

     (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby have been

directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub and by Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, and, except only, with respect to the Merger, for the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware pursuant to the DGCL, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation by them of the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of the Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid
and binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of
Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

Agreement and to pay all related fees and expenses. Parent has delivered to the
Company true and complete copies of the executed commitment letters, addressed
to Parent, from the parties listed in Section 3.6 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter (the "Equity Funding Parties"), to provide equity financing (the
"Financing") in the aggregate amounts set forth therein (the "Equity Funding
Letters"). No Equity Funding Letter has been amended, supplemented or modified
except as permitted in accordance with their respective terms, and the
respective commitments contained in the Equity Funding Letters have not been
withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. Each of the Equity Funding Letters in the
form so delivered is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of the Equity Funding Parties to Parent. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute
a default of Parent or any other party thereto under any of the Equity Funding
Letters. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as set forth in or
contemplated by the Equity Funding Letters. The aggregate proceeds contemplated
by the Equity Funding Letters will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to
pay the aggregate consideration contemplated by the Offer and, if applicable,

contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Equity Funding Parties has access to

     (xii) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, enter into any Company Material Contract or modify, amend, terminate
or waive in any material respect any rights under any existing Company Material

business" shall include undertaking contracts in connection with new Subsidiary

which there has been no "past practice";

     (xiii) make any capital expenditures not contemplated by the operating

     Section 4.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

     (a) Subject to compliance with applicable Laws, from and after the date
hereof and until the earlier of (x) the date on which a majority of the
Company's directors are designees of Parent or Merger Sub and (y) the
Termination Date, the Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries to (i)
afford Parent and its officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, financial advisors and agents, lenders and other representatives
(collectively, "Parent Representatives") reasonable access during normal
business hours to the properties, assets, books and records and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to Parent and Parent Representatives
such financial and operating data and other information as they may reasonably
request from time to time and (iii) instruct the employees, counsel, financial
advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives (other than directors
who are not employees) of the Company and its Subsidiaries to cooperate
reasonably with Parent in its investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to afford such access
if it would (w) unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (x) cause a violation of any agreement to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party, (y) subject to Section 4.2(c), reasonably be
expected to jeopardize any attorney-client privilege relating thereto or (z)
cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries.

                                       34

     (b) Parent hereby agrees that all information provided to Parent or Parent
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to constitute "Information," as
such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 10,
2007 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Company and Salford Georgia,
an affiliate of Parent and Merger Sub, and shall be treated in accordance with
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

     (c) To the extent that any Information may include materials subject to the
attorney-client privilege, the Company is not waiving and will not be deemed to
have waived or diminished its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client
privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing any
Information (including Information related to pending or threatened litigation)
to Parent and Parent's Representatives, regardless of whether the Company has
asserted or is or may be entitled to assert such privileges and protections. The
parties (i) share a common legal and commercial interest in all such Information
that is subject to such privileges and protections; (ii) are or may become joint
defendants in proceedings to which such Information covered by such protections
and privileges relates; and (iii) intend that such privileges and protections
remain intact should either party become subject to any actual or threatened
proceeding to which such Information covered by such protections and privileges
relates. In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and Parent's Representatives
shall not claim or contend, in proceedings involving either party, that the
Company waived its attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges
or similar protections and privileges with respect to any information, documents
or other material disclosed to Parent or Parent's Representatives due to the
Company disclosing Information (including Information related to pending or
threatened litigation) to Parent or Parent's Representatives in accordance with
this Section 4.2.

     Section 4.3 No Solicitation.

     (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 4.3 set forth below, from and
after the date hereof and until the earlier of (x) the date on which a majority
of the Company's directors are designees of Parent or Merger Sub and (y) the
Termination Date, the Company agrees that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that each of them shall direct their respective
officers, directors and representatives, including any investment bankers,
attorneys or accountants retained by any of them (each, a "Representative") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage
(including by providing non public information) or knowingly facilitate any
inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or would reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any
negotiations regarding, or provide or cause to be provided any non-public
information or data relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with, or have any discussions with any Person relating to, any actual
or proposed Alternative Proposal, or otherwise knowingly encourage or facilitate
any effort or attempt to propose publicly to approve, endorse or recommend any
Alternative Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal, (iv) approve,
endorse or recommend, or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other
similar agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Person relating to any
Alternative Proposal.

                                       35
<PAGE>


     (b) The Company shall, shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct each of its Representatives to, immediately cease any existing
solicitations, discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the
parties hereto) that has made or indicated an intention to make an Alternative
Proposal on or prior to the date hereof.

     (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 4.3(a) or (b), the
Company may, in response to an unsolicited written bona fide Alternative
Proposal that did not result from or arise in connection with a breach of this
Section 4.3 (a "Qualifying Alternative Proposal") and that the Board of
Directors determines, in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisors, may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (i) furnish non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Qualifying Alternative Proposal and its
representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement no less
restrictive in any material respect of and not more favorable in any material
respect to the other party than the confidentiality terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, such confidentiality
agreement need not include any "standstill" or prohibitions on the ability of
such third party to communicate with the Company's minority partners in an
effort to facilitate the consummation of the Qualifying Alternative Proposal),
and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person and its
representatives regarding such Qualifying Alternative Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company shall promptly provide or make available to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Qualifying Alternative
Proposal or its representatives that was not previously provided or made
available to Parent.

     (d) The Board of Directors shall not withdraw, qualify or modify the
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose
to do so, or approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend,
any Alternative Proposal; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, the Board of Directors may (subject to
the Company's compliance with this Section 4.3) withdraw, qualify or modify its
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub (a "Change of
Recommendation") if, prior to the Acceptance Date, in response to a Qualifying
Alternative Proposal, the Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, that (x) such
Qualifying Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) failure
to so withdraw, qualify or modify its Recommendation would be inconsistent with
the Board of Directors' exercise of its fiduciary duties; and provided, further,
that no such Change of Recommendation may be effected unless, (i) prior to
effecting such Change of Recommendation, the Company provides written notice to
Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of the proposed effective
date of such Change of Recommendation (the "Notice Period"), of its intention to
effect such Change of Recommendation, which notice shall specify all material
terms and conditions of the Qualifying Alternative Proposal giving rise to such
Change of Recommendation (including the identity of the Person making such
Qualifying Alternative Proposal and copies of any documents or correspondence
evidencing such Qualifying Alternative Proposal), and any material modifications
to any of the foregoing, (ii) during the Notice Period, if Parent shall so
request, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors and outside
counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Qualifying Alternative
Proposal ceases to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors) a Superior Proposal, and (iii) such Qualifying Alternative Proposal
continues to constitute (in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors) a
Superior Proposal after taking into account any such amendments that Parent
shall have agreed to make prior to the end of the Notice Period. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, the Board of Directors may withdraw, modify or
amend the Recommendation at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if, in each
case, it determines, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure to take such action is reasonably likely to result in a breach of its
fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may not take any such action in
response to or in connection with an Alternative Proposal except pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 4.3(d).

                                       36

     (e) The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Alternative Proposal or indication or
inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Proposal and (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not
reasonably expected to be related to an Alternative Proposal, including in each
case a description of the material terms of any such Alternative Proposal or
indication, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of any material change to the terms of
any such Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry or request.

     (f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9, Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement
pending disclosure of its position thereunder. In addition, it is understood and
agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement (including Article VI), (i) a
factually accurate public statement by the Company that describes the Company's
receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto, shall not be deemed a withdrawal or modification, or proposal
by the Board of Directors of the Company to withdraw or modify the
Recommendation, or an approval or recommendation with respect to such
Alternative Proposal so long as such public statement includes a statement that
the Board of Directors continues to support the Recommendation, and (ii) any
"stop, look and listen" communication by the Board of Directors pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, or any similar communication to the
shareholders of the Company or otherwise, shall not constitute a Change of
Recommendation or a withdrawal or modification, or proposal by the Board of
Directors to withdraw or modify the Recommendation, or an approval or
recommendation with respect to any Alternative Proposal.

                                       37

     (g) As used in this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" shall mean (i) any
proposal, inquiry, indication of interest or offer from any Person or group of
Persons (other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) for a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving the
Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose business
constitutes 20% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than in respect of any interest
not owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii) any proposal for the
issuance by the Company of over 20% of its equity securities or (iii) any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of
the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and other than in respect of any
interest not owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, for the avoidance of doubt it is understood and
agreed that any action on the part of the Company's minority partners in
International Telcell Cellular, a Delaware corporation, including in respect to
the transfer, sale or other disposition of their ownership interests in such
Company Subsidiary, shall not be deemed to be a breach of any of the terms and
conditions of this Section 4.3.

     (h) As used in this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any
Alternative Proposal (i) on terms that the Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Shares than the Offer and the
Merger, taking into account all of the respective terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal, and (ii) that the Board of Directors believes is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; provided, however, that
for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%"
in the definition of Alternative Proposal shall be replaced by "50%".

     Section 4.4 Filings; Other Actions.

     (a) If the Short Form Merger is not available in accordance with Section
1.12 of this Agreement and the Company Stockholder Approval is required under
the DGCL, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the consummation or
expiration of the Offer and the Company becoming current with respect to the
filing of all outstanding periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC or
having received a waiver from the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, which shall, subject to
Section 4.3, include the Recommendation, and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC staff in respect of the
Proxy Statement. Parent and Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to, provide to the Company such information as the Company may reasonably
request for inclusion in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement is
cleared by the SEC. The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify Parent
of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the
Proxy Statement. The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the draft of the Proxy Statement
(including each amendment or supplement thereto). The Company shall provide
Parent with copies of all filings made and correspondence with the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any
information should be discovered by any party hereto which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to
the stockholders of the Company.

                                       38

     (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement and the Company's
ability to timely file periodic reports with the SEC, the Company shall (i) take
all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (such meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof,
the "Company Meeting"), and (ii) subject to a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 4.3(d), use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

     Section 4.5 Employee Matters.

     (a) From and after the Acceptance Date, the Company and, after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the
Company and the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to, honor all Company
Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Acceptance Date; provided,
however, that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the amendment or
termination of any such Company Benefit Plans or compensation arrangements or
agreements in accordance with their terms and applicable Law at any time or from
time to time thereafter.

     (b) As of the Acceptance Date, Parent, the Company and, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, and each of their respective Subsidiaries shall
have all applicable obligations, liabilities and commitments in respect of
providing notices and making available health care continuation coverage
required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended, for all present and former Employees (and their qualifying spouses or
dependents) who are eligible for such coverage at any time prior to or following
the Acceptance Date.

     Section 4.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

     (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use
all commercially reasonable efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant to
this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) obtaining all necessary Consents, (ii) defending
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) consulting and
cooperating with, providing assistance to and furnishing information requested
by the other party in the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Schedule
TO, the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, as
applicable, and all necessary amendments and supplements thereto, and (iv)
executing and delivering any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

<PAGE>


     (b) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including to the extent permitted by Law promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications sent or
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, to or from any third party or any Governmental Entity
with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent shall permit the other
party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any supervisory
or Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to initiate
any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting or discussion.

     (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 4.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall cooperate in all respects with
each other and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 4.6 shall limit a
party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(c) so long as
such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under
this Section 4.6.

     (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 4.6, and notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
in this Agreement, in the event that, prior to the commencement of the Offer,
the Common Shares or the Preferred Shares, as the case may be, are deregistered
under the Exchange Act, whether in connection with the Restatement and Related
Matters or otherwise, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist
and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under all applicable Laws to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

     Section 4.7 Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute shall become
applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and the members of their respective
Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby, and
shall otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover
Statute on the transactions contemplated hereby.

     Section 4.8 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
none of the parties to this Agreement shall issue or cause the publication of
any press release or any other announcement or communication with respect to
this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or any other transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other parties, except in any
case where such release, announcement or communication is required by applicable
Law, any requirement of any Governmental Entity, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in
which case such party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to consult
with the other parties prior to making any such disclosure.

     Section 4.9 Indemnification and Insurance.

     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, cause the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws or
similar organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Company's
Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification than are set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, respectively, or similar organizational documents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers,
employees, fiduciaries or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. From
and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, the obligations of the Company pursuant to any
indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of
each present or former director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") contained in the
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or similar organizational
documents of its Subsidiaries, or in any agreement between an Indemnified Party
and the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to any
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission, in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
occurring at or before the Effective Time. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received (provided the
applicable Indemnified Party provides an undertaking, to the extent required by
applicable Law, the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or
similar organizational documents of its Subsidiaries, or by the applicable
agreement between an Indemnified Party and the Company, to repay all advanced
expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification), and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
the Surviving Corporation's prior written consent; and provided, further, that
the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 4.9(a)
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality
of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single action, except to the extent that two or
more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome
of such action. In the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or
made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
such claim shall continue until the disposition of such claim.

                                       41

     (b) At or prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall purchase, at the
Company's expense, an extended "tail" reporting period for the Company's
directors' and officers' liability insurance in effect as of the date hereof
(the "Current D&O Policy"), which extended "tail" reporting period shall (i) be
for an effective period of six (6) years after the Acceptance Date, (ii) be for
the benefit of those Persons who are covered by the Current D&O Policy, (iii) be
purchased at a premium not in excess of the amount set forth in Section 4.9(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iv) shall contain terms with respect to
coverage and amount no less favorable than those contained in the Current D&O
Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such extended "tail" reporting period
cannot be obtained, or can only be obtained by the payment of a premium in
excess of the amount set forth in Section 4.9(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, then the Company shall only be required to purchase such extended
period, if any, as may be available for such length of time as can be obtained
by the payment of a premium not in excess of such amount. If such "tail" policy
has been obtained by the Company prior to the Acceptance Date, Parent and the
Company (and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall maintain
such "tail" policy in full force and effect for its full term and shall continue
to honor the Company's obligations thereunder.

     (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.9.

     (d) The provisions of this Section 4.9 are intended to be (i) for the
benefit of, and shall grant third party rights to and be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have, by contract or otherwise. If any
Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this Section 4.9 that is denied by Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such claim against Parent or
the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 4.10 Control of Operations. Without in any way limiting any party's
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the Company's operations
prior to the Acceptance Date. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

     Section 4.11 Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the

     Section 4.16 Back-End Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, Parent shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, use its
reasonable best efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws to consummate and make effective, as promptly as reasonable, the Merger.

     Section 4.17 Preferred Stock.

     (a) Parent and the Merger Sub hereby agree to cause the Company to comply
with all of the provisions of the Certificate of Designation (including Section
5 thereof) from and after the Acceptance Date.

     (b) Following consummation of the Merger, in the event any holder of Common
Shares or Preferred Shares, as the case may be, demands and perfects such
holder's right to dissent from the Merger and seek an appraisal of such holder's
Shares, then for so long as there is any pending appraisal proceeding before a
court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, the
Surviving Corporation shall not, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation not to, directly or indirectly, sell, lease, pledge or exchange any
property, pay any dividend or make any loan or distribution to its shareholders
or any affiliate of its shareholders, unless in any such case the aggregate
value of the assets of the Company following such transaction is equal to or
exceeds the sum of (x) 200% of the product of the number of Common Shares in
respect of which there is a pending appraisal proceeding at the time of such
transaction multiplied by the Merger Consideration and (y) the number of
Preferred Shares in respect of which there is a pending appraisal proceeding at
the time of such transaction multiplied by the Liquidation Preference (as
defined in the Certificate of Designation) of the Preferred Shares, provided
that this provision will not prohibit any sale, lease, pledge or exchange of
property to any third party that is not an affiliate of the Company, Parent or
its shareholders (or any affiliate of Parent's shareholders) for fair market
value, provided, further, that in the event of a sale, lease, pledge or exchange
referenced in the preceding proviso, the Surviving Corporation shall not, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, directly or indirectly, pay
any dividend or make any loan or distribution to its shareholders or any
affiliate of its shareholders unless the aggregate value of the assets of the
Company following such dividend, loan or distribution is equal to or exceeds the
amounts referenced in clauses (x) and (y) above. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the protections provided in the preceding sentence are designed
to provide credit protection and security for any potential claim a dissenting
holder might have against the Company or the Surviving Corporation as a result
of the final resolution of such pending appraisal proceeding(s). Any holder of
Preferred Shares that has validly exercised (and not withdrawn) appraisal rights
shall have the right to enforce this Section 4.17(b) against Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective successors and assigns. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the foregoing protections are not intended, and shall not be construed, to
affect or have any relevance to the determination of the "fair value" of any
Shares in any appraisal proceeding, or to indicate or imply that such "fair
value" may exceed the Merger Consideration, in the case of an appraisal
proceeding with respect to any Common Shares, or may be determined based upon,
or be equal to, the Liquidation Preference, in the case of an appraisal
proceeding with respect to any Preferred Shares.

of the Company's securities are held by holders other than Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective affiliates, and notwithstanding that the Company may not be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, the Company shall use reasonable commercial efforts to timely prepare and
make available to its stockholders (which may be done by posting such materials
on the Company's website), without cost to such stockholders, quarterly and
annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted

the conditions set forth on Annex I hereto) shall be subject to the fulfillment
(or waiver by Parent and the Company), at or prior to the Effective Time, of the
following conditions:

     (a) Acceptance of Shares. Merger Sub shall have accepted for purchase the
Common Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof
and thereof; provided, however, that the condition set forth in this Section
5.1(a) shall be deemed satisfied if Merger Sub shall have failed, in breach of

Offer.

     (b) Expiration of Subsequent Offering Period. Any subsequent offering
period made available by Merger Sub pursuant to Section 1.1(d) shall have

have enacted, issued or entered any restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or similar legal restraint or prohibition which remains in effect
that enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Merger.

                                   TERMINATION

accepted for payment and paid for Common Shares pursuant to the Offer on or
before December 31, 2007 (the "End Date");

     (c) Injunction. By either the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Entity
shall have issued or entered an order, injunction or similar legal restraint
permanently enjoining or otherwise permanently prohibiting the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger, and such order, injunction or legal restraint shall
have become final and non-appealable;

     (d) Breach by Parent or Merger Sub. By the Company, if (x) Parent or Merger
Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (i) would (A) reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect or (B) result
in a failure of any Tender Offer Condition or any condition set forth in Section
5.1 to be capable of being satisfied, or the Offer to be consummated, by the End
Date and (ii) is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by Parent or Merger
Sub within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by the Company
to Parent or (y) all of the Tender Offer Conditions (excluding conditions that,
by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the Expiration Date, but which would
be reasonably capable of being satisfied at the expiration of the Offer) are
satisfied or waived and Parent and Merger Sub fail to accept for payment or pay
for any tendered Common Shares in accordance with their obligations under this
Agreement, including Section 1.1(e);

     (e) Breach by Company. By Parent, if the Company shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would result in a failure of the Tender Offer Condition set forth in paragraph
(c) or (d) of Annex I or any condition set forth in Section 5.1 to be capable of
being satisfied, or the Offer to be consummated, by the End Date, and (ii) such
breach or failure is not curable or, if curable, is not cured by the Company
within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the
Company;

     (f) Superior Proposal. By the Company, if the Board of Directors shall have
approved, endorsed or recommended any Superior Proposal in accordance with the
first sentence of Section 4.3(d); provided, however, that any such purported
termination pursuant to this Section 6.1(f) shall be void and of no force and
effect unless, prior to or concurrently with, and in either case as a condition
to, the effectiveness of such termination, the Company pays the Termination Fee
and the Termination Expenses in accordance with Section 6.3;

     (g) Change of Recommendation. By Parent, if the Board of Directors shall
have (i) effected, or publicly proposed to effect, a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with Section 4.3 or (ii) approved, endorsed or recommended, or

and

     (h) No Tender Offer Extension. By either the Company or Parent, if the
Tender Offer Conditions have not been satisfied or waived at any scheduled
Expiration Date and the Offer is not extended pursuant to Section 1.1(d) of this
Agreement; provided, that for the avoidance of doubt it is understood and agreed
that (after giving effect to any tolling thereof pursuant to the second to last
sentence of Section 1.1(d)) Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.1(h) if it is in breach of clause (i) of the third sentence of
Section 1.1(d).

     Proposal and such Eligible Alternative Proposal is subsequently
     consummated, and (C) such termination was not due to a material breach by

     Company shall pay Parent (1) an amount equal to $5,500,000 (the
     "Termination Fee") and (2) an amount, not to exceed $2,000,000, equal to
     the Expenses of Parent, Merger Sub and their respective affiliates (the

     Termination Expenses and (B) if, concurrently with such termination or
     within twelve (12) months after the Termination Date the Company or any of
     its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
     consummates, any Eligible Alternative Proposal, then the Company shall also
     pay Parent the Termination Fee;

          (iii) by the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(f), then the Company

     Parent the Termination Fee and the Termination Expenses.

     (b) The Termination Fee shall be paid to Parent or its designee by the

receipt by the Company of reasonable documentation with respect to such
Termination Expenses.

     (c) Parent and Merger Sub agree that, if this Agreement shall be terminated
pursuant to Section 6.1(b) (due to a material breach by Parent or Merger Sub) or
Section 6.1(d), then Parent shall pay to the Company a fee of $10,000,000 (the
"Parent Termination Fee") in cash, payable in immediately available funds upon
termination of this Agreement, and in such case, neither Parent nor Merger Sub
shall have any further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; it being understood that in no event shall
Parent or Merger Sub be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent shall deliver to the
Company one or more letters of credit, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, from one or more financial institutions selected by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company, which letters of credit shall have an
aggregate face amount sufficient to satisfy and secure Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee under this Section 6.3(c). In the
event the conditions to the termination of such letters of credit set forth
therein are satisfied, the Company shall promptly execute and deliver to each of
the financial institutions that issued such letters of credit a written
certificate or statement, in the form attached to such letters of credit or
otherwise required by such financial institutions, certifying on behalf of the
Company that the conditions to the termination of such letters of credit have
been satisfied and that such letters of credit should as a result be terminated.

two or more consecutive counterparts (including by facsimile), each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and

                             Tender Offer Conditions
                             -----------------------

     Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall not be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (relating to Parent's obligation to pay for or return tendered
Shares promptly after termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for, and
(subject to any such rules and regulations) may, to the extent expressly
permitted by this Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered
Common Shares if (i) the number of Common Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer, as it may be extended in
accordance with Section 1.1, is less than the sum of (x) 63,300,000 Common
Shares plus (y) the total number of Common Shares, if any, issued or issuable
(solely in the case of Common Shares issuable, such Common Shares issuable but
not yet issued in response to any notice, duly and validly given (and not
subsequently withdrawn) by a holder to the Company on or prior to the Expiration
Date, of election to exercise a Company Stock Option or Warrant or to convert
Preferred Shares) after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Expiration
Date (such number, the "Minimum Condition") or (ii) if any of the following
events or conditions shall occur and be continuing as of any scheduled
expiration date of the Offer:

          (a) a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted
     issued or entered any restraining order, preliminary or permanent
     injunction or similar order or legal restraint or prohibition which remains
     in effect that enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer,
     the Top-Up Option or the Merger;

          (b) this Agreement shall have been terminated by the Company, Merger
     Sub or Parent in accordance with its terms;

          (c) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set
     forth in Section 2.2(a) and (b) and 2.19 shall not be true and correct in
     all respects (except, in the case of Sections 2.2(a) and (b), for such
     inaccuracies as are de minimis in the aggregate), in each case at and as of
     the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Expiration Date as though
     made at and as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent expressly made
     as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), or (ii) any of the
     other representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein shall
     not be true and correct, in each case at and as of the date of this
     Agreement and at and as of the Expiration Date as though made at and as of
     the Expiration Date (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
     date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such
     representations and warranties to be so true and correct would not have,
     individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

          (d) the Company shall not have performed in all material respects all
     obligations and complied with all covenants required by this Agreement to
     be performed or complied with by it prior to the Expiration Date and such
     failure to perform shall not have been cured prior to the Expiration Date;
     or

<PAGE>


          (e) Since the execution of this Agreement, there shall have occurred a
     Company Material Adverse Effect.

     Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the foregoing conditions are for
the sole benefit of Merger Sub and may be asserted by Merger Sub regardless of
the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions (other than any such
circumstances caused by or substantially contributed to by any breach by Parent
or Merger Sub of any of their representations, warranties, covenants agreements
or obligations under this Agreement) and may be waived by Merger Sub in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time, in each case except for the Minimum
Condition, in the exercise of the reasonable good faith judgment of Merger Sub
and subject to the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
Section 1.1(b). The failure by Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and
from time to time, in each case prior to the acceptance for payment of, and
payment for, tendered Common Shares.
