items referred to above) and all items disputed by Plains that remain unresolved will be settled and paid within five Business Days following the Closing Date or such later date as the Independent
Consultant has resolved all such items disputed by Plains. At the Closing, Plains shall deposit with J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A. (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Escrow

(on behalf of the Plains Parties) may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Link at any time prior to the Closing in the event (A)&nbsp;(1) Link
has within the then-previous ten Business Days given Plains any notice pursuant to Section&nbsp;5(e) above and (2)&nbsp;the development that is the subject of the notice has had a
Material Adverse Effect and would result in a failure of the condition set forth in Section&nbsp;7(a)(i)&nbsp;or (B)&nbsp;of a Casualty Loss giving rise to a right of termination pursuant to

any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement and any such breaches, individually or in the aggregate, result in a failure of the condition specified in Section&nbsp;7(a)(i),
Plains has notified Link of the breach, and the breach has continued without cure for a period of three days after the notice of breach; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;Link
(on behalf of the Link Parties) may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Plains at any time prior to the Closing in the event Plains has breached
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement and such breach constitutes a material adverse effect on Plains' ability to consummate the transactions contemplated in this

Proposal received after the date hereof that was not solicited, encouraged or facilitated in breach of, and did not otherwise result from a breach of, Section&nbsp;5(j), that acceptance of such
Superior Proposal is required to comply with its fiduciary duties to Link's debtholders and unitholders under applicable Law, (B)&nbsp;Link, at the direction of such Special Committee of the Board
of Directors, notifies Plains in writing (a "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Superior Proposal Termination Notice</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") that it intends to terminate this Agreement and enter into an

notification of its intention to enter into a binding agreement for a Superior Proposal, an offer that such Special Committee of the Board of Directors, by majority vote of the entire Special
Committee of the Board of Directors, determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors, is at least as favorable to Link's debtholders and unitholders as such Superior Proposal,
it being understood that Link shall not enter into any binding agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal during such five-Business Day period (it being further understood and agreed
that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Superior Proposal Termination Notice and a new five Business Day period),
(D)&nbsp;prior to such termination, Link shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Plains to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and/or in the Plan of Merger as would enable Link to proceed with the transactions contemplated herein and (E)&nbsp;Link concurrently with termination pursuant to this
