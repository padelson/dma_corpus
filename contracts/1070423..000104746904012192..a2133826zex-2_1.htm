2. _ The Transaction._ 

  

 (a) _ Plan of Merger; the Merger; Canadian Asset Sale._ (i) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, (A) the Link Constituent Parties shall enter into the Plan of Merger and take all actions on their part required in order to consummate the Merger and to perform their other Obligations thereunder and (B) the Plains Constituent Parties shall enter into the Plan of Merger and take all actions on their part required in order to consummate the Merger and to perform their other Obligations thereunder. 

  

  

 (ii) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, at the Closing, (A) Plains shall cause Plains Canada and PMC to purchase from LECLP and Link Canada, and LECLP and Link Canada shall sell, transfer, convey and deliver to Plains Canada and PMC, pursuant to one or more bills of sale and assumption agreements substantially in the forms attached as _Exhibit K_, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens, all of LECLP\'s and Link Canada\'s right, title and interest in and to all of the Crude Oil Business Assets owned by either of them, and (B) Plains shall cause Plains Canada and PMC to assume and become responsible for all of the Plains Allocated Liabilities to the extent residing in LECLP or Link Canada (such transaction, the " _Canadian Asset Sale_ "). 

  

  

 (b) _ Purchase Price; Escrow Amount._ In consideration of the Link Parties\' willingness to consummate the Merger and the Canadian Asset Sale, the Plains Parties shall pay to the Link Parties the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds, which will be payable as follows: (i) at the Closing, the Plains Constituent Parties shall pay to the Link Constituent Parties the Estimated Purchase Price _less_ $10,000,000 million, _less_ the Debt Reduction Adjustment, if any, _plus_ the Funding Adjustment, if any, to an account designated in writing by Link; and (ii) upon the Purchase Price adjustments being finally agreed upon or determined pursuant to Section 2(f), Plains shall pay to Link the amount (if any) determined to be owed to Link in accordance with Section 2(f). The " _Debt Reduction Adjustment_ " shall mean the amount, if any, by which the Net Debt Payoff Target exceeds the aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of all Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 1(a)_ of Link and its Affiliates, net of unrestricted cash (other than cash proceeds from the Link Parties\' litigation settlement with Shell Oil Company and its Affiliates), as of the Closing Date (such aggregate principal and accrued interest amount of Indebtedness net of unrestricted cash being set forth in the Officer\'s Certificate delivered on the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2(e)(v)). The " _Funding Adjustment_ " 

   means a positive cash amount equal to the sum of (i) the negative net cash
flows, if any, from the operations of the Crude Oil Business from April 1,
2004 to but excluding the Closing Date, without inclusion of (A) interest
costs of Indebtedness and financing and/or other fees and expenses
attributable to such Indebtedness, (B) fees or expenses associated with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the litigation and/or
settlement of the litigation with Shell Oil Company and its Affiliates or (C)
fees or expenses directly attributable to a Link Retained Item, Link Retained
Obligation or Link Allocated Asset, and (ii) accrued interest on the Base
Purchase Price from April 2, 2004 to but excluding the Closing Date at a
rate of 5.0% per annum. If the net cash flows from the operations of the
Crude Oil Business from April 1, 2004 to but excluding the Closing Date are
positive, then a cash amount equal to such positive amount will be included
as a Crude Oil Business Asset and allocated to the Plains Constituent Parties
in the Merger (but, for the avoidance of doubt, such cash amount will not be
included as a current asset in the calculation of Net Working Capital). If
the Closing Date does not occur on April 1, 2004, then on each Business Day
thereafter until the Closing Date Link shall deliver a daily cash report to
Plains, which report will reference all items that impact the Funding
Adjustment (the " _Funding Report_ "). Link will afford representatives of
the Plains Parties the opportunity to review all information analyzed by the
Link Parties in preparing each Funding Report. Plains may dispute any items
impacting the Funding Adjustment by providing written notice to Link of its
objections within two Business Days of receipt of the applicable Funding
Report. Commencing promptly following delivery of such notice, Link
(on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties)
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disputed items and, if no
resolution is reached on or before the third Business Day following the
Closing, all unresolved, disputed items shall be submitted by Link or Plains
to the Independent Consultant, and the decision of the Independent Consultant
with respect to such disputed items shall be binding upon the Parties. If the
Closing Date does not occur on April 1, 2004, the Funding Adjustment will be
calculated with reference to the Funding Reports, disregarding all items
disputed by Plains that remain unresolved. Any disparity between the Funding
Adjustment paid at Closing and actual cash flows of the Crude Oil Business
(without inclusion of the items referred to above) and all items disputed by
Plains that remain unresolved will be settled and paid within five Business
Days following the Closing Date or such later date as the
Independent Consultant has resolved all such items disputed by Plains. At the
Closing, Plains shall deposit with J.P. Morgan Trust Company, N.A. (the "
_Escrow Agent_ ") $10,000,000 plus the Debt Reduction Adjustment, if any,
such amount to be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent and to be released and
disbursed from such escrow in accordance with the terms set forth in Sections
2(f)(viii), 2(g)(ii), 2(g)(iii), 2(g)(iv) and 10(c). The Parties acknowledge
that the Purchase Price payable at Closing pursuant to this Section 2(b) will
be deposited with and disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to a flow of
funds memo reasonably acceptable to Link and Plains.

  

 (c) _ Preliminary Closing Statement._ The Estimated Purchase Price is based upon the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment as of the date of this Agreement, as set forth in the written statement attached hereto as _Schedule 2(c)(iii)_ (the " _Preliminary Closing Statement_ "). The Preliminary Closing Statement has been prepared and signed by Link (on behalf of the Link Parties). The " _Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment_ " represents Link\'s reasonable, good faith estimate of the Purchase Price adjustments contemplated by Sections 2(f)(v), (vi) and (vii) and PWC\'s review of such estimates based on the information available to PWC in connection with such review, and the Preliminary Closing Statement reflects Link\'s estimate of each of the adjustments pursuant to such Sections 2(f)(v), (vi) and (vii). The fees and expenses due PWC for the performance of such review shall be paid by Plains. 

   

 (d) _ Closing; Closing Date; Effective Time._ Subject to Sections 7(a) and (b), the Closing (the " _Closing_ ") shall, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) and Link (on behalf of the Link Parties), take place at the offices of Vinson and Elkins, L.L.P. located at 1001 Fannin, Houston, Texas at 10:00 a.m., local time, on April 1, 2004, or at such other time and place as agreed to in writing by the Parties (the date on which the Closing occurs being referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_ "). The effective time of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for 

     

purposes of the Purchase Price adjustments set forth in Section 2(f) shall be

 (f) _ Purchase Price Adjustments._ 

  

  

 (i) The Parties acknowledge and agree that _Exhibit B_ to _Schedule 2(f)_ sets forth a description of the minimum volume and the related quality of Crude Oil (as defined in _Exhibit A_ to _Schedule 2(f))_ (regardless of whether designated by any Link Party as linefill or operating inventory) necessary to operate the Pipeline Systems (as defined in _Exhibit A_ to _Schedule 2(f))_ comprising part of the Crude Oil Business Assets and the minimum volume and related quality of Crude Oil necessary for the Crude Oil Business to ship on the pipeline systems not owned by the Link Parties but utilized in the Crude Oil Business in the Ordinary Course of Business. Such _Exhibit B_ describes such minimum volume and quality of Crude Oil. _Exhibit D_ to _Schedule 2(f)_ describes the pricing formula applicable for each such quality of Crude Oil included in such  _Exhibit B_. 

  

 (ii) In connection with the Closing, Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) and Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) shall effect the reconciliation procedures described on _Schedule 2(f)_ to determine the Net Inventory Adjustment (as defined in _Exhibit A_ to _Schedule 2(f))_. If the Net Inventory Adjustment is a positive amount, such Net Inventory Adjustment shall be included as a current asset in Net Working Capital, and if such Net Inventory Adjustment is a negative amount, then such Net Inventory Adjustment shall be included as a current liability in Net Working Capital. 

  

 (iii) The Purchase Price has been agreed upon based on the Net Working Capital at the Effective Time being equal to the Target Net Working Capital. 

   

 (iv) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) will prepare and provide to Link a statement signed by Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) showing the Net Working Capital of the Crude Oil Business (" _Working Capital Statement_ ") at the Effective 

  

    
  

Time and a statement showing the calculation of the Net Inventory Adjustment
(the " _Crude Statement_ "). The Working Capital Statement shall reflect
the value associated with each line item component comprising the Net Working
Capital and shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of _Schedule
1(d)_. Plains will afford representatives of the Link Parties the opportunity
to participate in and review the preparation and calculation of the Working
Capital Statement and the Crude Statement, including the opportunity to
observe accounting procedures and review all work papers and other relevant
documents. At Link\'s request (which request shall be made no later than 30
days after the Closing Date), PWC shall review each of the Working Capital
Statement and the Crude Statement. The fees and expenses due PWC for the
performance of such review, if so requested by Link, shall be paid by Link. If
Link disputes the Working Capital Statement or Crude Statement or any part
thereof, then Link shall provide to Plains written notice (" _Dispute Notice_
") on or before the 30th day after the date of Link\'s receipt of the Working
Capital Statement and the Crude Statement setting forth in reasonable detail
the portion or portions of those documents that are disputed by Link. If no
Dispute Notice is delivered within such 30-day period, the Working Capital
Statement and Crude Statement shall become final and binding on the Parties
and the Purchase Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 2(f) based
on the same. Commencing promptly after delivery of a Dispute Notice, Plains
(on behalf of the Plains Parties) and Link (on behalf of the Link Parties)
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute and, if no resolution
is reached on or before the tenth day after the expiration of such 30-day
period, the disputed matters shall be submitted by the Parties (and may be
submitted by either Party) to the Independent Consultant, and the decision of
the Independent Consultant shall be binding on the Parties.

  

 (v) The Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Net Working Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital. The Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working Capital exceeds the Net Working Capital. For example, if Net Working Capital is determined to be -$15.4 million (i.e. current liabilities used in the calculations, as per _Schedule 1(d)_, of Net Working Capital exceed current assets used in the calculation, as per _Schedule 1(d)_, of Net Working Capital by $15.4 million), then the Purchase Price would be adjusted upward by $4.0 million since the Net Working Capital amount of - $15.4 million exceeds the Target Net Working Capital amount of -$19.4 million by $4.0 million. 

  

 (vi) If any of the Available Employees are terminated by Link or Link Canada after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Closing with the written consent of Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties), then the Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the amount of severance paid by Link or Link Canada to such Available Employees consistent with Link\'s or Link Canada\'s severance policy (such severance policy being described on _Schedule 2(f)(vi_)) or consistent with Link\'s or Link Canada\'s employment agreement or change in control agreement with each such Available Employee); _provided_ , such adjustment will not exceed per Available Employee more than two weeks pay per year of service with a maximum of 26 weeks and a minimum of four weeks, in addition to associated payroll Taxes, calculated on the basis of such Available Employee\'s salary in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

  

 (vii) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by $1,553,354.05 (the " _Change of Control Adjustment_ "), the amount by which the aggregate amount to be paid by Plains pursuant to Section 6(c)(ii)(C) to the Specified Available Employees or to Link exceeds the aggregate amount which would have been payable to the Specified Available Employees (if terminated on the Closing Date) under the terms of Link\'s severance plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement, calculated on the basis of the Specified Available Employees\' respective salaries in effect on the date of this Agreement (and not to exceed per Specified Available Employee more than two weeks 

  

    

pay per year of service with a maximum of 26 weeks and a minimum of four
weeks, in addition to associated payroll Taxes).

   

 (viii) Within two Business Days after all Purchase Price adjustments are finally agreed upon or determined pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 2(f), all of such Purchase Price adjustments shall be combined on a statement prepared by Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) and delivered to Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) (the " _Post-Closing Statement_ ") and (A) if the combination of such Purchase Price adjustments results in the Purchase Price exceeding the Estimated Purchase Price, then Plains shall pay to Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) the amount of such excess plus a yield on the amount of such excess from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at a yield rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate plus 1% per annum (the " _Specified Rate_ "), and (B) if the combination of such Purchase Price adjustments results in the Estimated Purchase Price exceeding the Purchase Price, then Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint letter whereby Link and Plains instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) out of the Escrow Amount (including the Debt Reduction Adjustment) the amount of such excess, plus a yield on the amount of such excess from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of payment at the Specified Rate; _provided_ , that all of the Link Parties\' obligations under this clause (viii)(B) shall be satisfied solely out of the Escrow Amount (including the Debt Reduction Adjustment), and no Link Party shall be liable to any Plains Party for amounts that cannot be satisfied out of such Escrow Amount (including the Debt Reduction Adjustment). 

  

  

 (g) _ Escrow._ 

  

  

 (i) At the Closing, Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) shall enter into an escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent in the form attached as _Exhibit G_. As reflected in _Exhibit G_: 

    

 (A) The fee and other charges of the Escrow Agent shall be borne and paid one-half (1/2) each by Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties). 

  

 (B) Except for Tax Payments distributed to Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, disbursements of the Escrow Amount shall require the joint written instruction from Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) or the order of a court with jurisdiction. 

   

 (C) The Escrow Amount shall be invested in permitted investments (as defined in _Exhibit G_). Earnings resulting from such permitted investments shall become part of the Escrow Amount. 

  

 (D) The escrow with respect to the Escrow Amount will terminate upon all of the Escrow Amount being disbursed in accordance with the terms of Section 2(f)(viii), 2(g)(ii), 2(g)(iii), 2(g)(iv) and 10(c). 

  

 (E) In accordance with Proposed Treas. Reg. § 1.468B-8(c), Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) shall be treated as the owner of any assets that are part of the Escrow Amount (including the Debt Reduction Adjustment) and shall be entitled to receive Tax Payments in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (F) To the extent Plains is deemed not to own the Escrow Amount prior to disbursement, Plains shall have a first priority lien and security interest on any interest of Link Parties in and to the Escrow Amount to secure the payment and performance by the Link Parties of their obligations pursuant to Sections 2(f)(viii), 2(g)(ii), 2(g)(iii), 2(g)(iv) and 10(c). 

   

     
   

 (ii) If the payment or disbursement (as applicable) contemplated by Section 2(f)(viii) shall not have been paid or disbursed on or prior to the date which is 90 days following the Closing Date, then on such 90th day Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint instruction letter whereby Link and Plains instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to: 

    

 A. Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties), the aggregate amount due to the Plains Parties pursuant to Sections 2(f)(viii)(B) that are not subject to dispute by Link (through the delivery of a Dispute Notice) as of the 90th day following the Closing Date, and 

  

 B. Link (on behalf of the Link Parties), the amount (if any) by which the Debt Reduction Adjustment exceeds the sum of (1) the amount disbursed to Plains as set forth in Section 2(g)(ii)(A) above, plus (2) the amount subject to a timely submitted Dispute Notice. If such amount is a negative amount, no disbursement shall be made to Link. 

    

 (iii) To the extent that Link has timely submitted a Dispute Notice, then within two Business Days after the resolution of the matters referenced in such Dispute Notice, Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint instruction letter to disburse to Plains the amounts due to it (if any) in accordance with either (A) the terms mutually agreed upon by Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) or (B) the determination of the Independent Consultant. In the event any amount in respect of the Debt Reduction Adjustment remains in the Escrow Account following any such disbursement, Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a joint instruction letter to disburse to Link the remainder of such Debt Reduction Adjustment.

B.

 to Plains (on behalf of the Plains Parties) 50% of the Escrow Amount remaining after the disbursements to Plains and Link (if any) contemplated by, without duplication, Sections 2(f)(viii), 2(g)(ii) and 2(g)(iii).

At the Closing, Plains shall pay, by wire transfer (or Automated Clearing House direct deposit) of immediately available funds (or, if the applicable Specified Available Employee has not provided Plains with necessary bank account details, by check), (i) to each Specified Available Employee the amount, less applicable withholding Taxes in an amount specified by Link, to which such Specified Available Employee is entitled in the event of a Change in Control Termination (as such term is defined in the applicable employment agreement or change in control agreement) pursuant to the terms of the applicable employment agreement or change in control agreement and (ii) to Link the amount of the applicable withholding Taxes not paid to each Specified Available Employee; _provided_ , that such Specified Available Employee executes and delivers at the time of such payment a Settlement and Release Agreement in the form attached as _Exhibit N_; _provided_ , _further_ , that if such Specified Available Employee does not execute and deliver such Settlement and Release Agreement, Plains shall make the payment contemplated by this Section 6(c)(ii)(C), including any applicable withholding Taxes, in respect of such Specified Available Employee to Link (on behalf of the Link Parties) and the Link Parties shall retain all obligations under such employment agreement or change in control agreement. 

   

 (D) The Plains Parties shall indemnify and hold harmless the Link Parties from losses arising from severance claims made by any Available Employee terminated by any Plains Party after the Closing; _provided_ , that such indemnification obligation with respect to any particular Available Employee shall not exceed the amount which would have been payable to such Available Employee under the terms of any Link Party\'s severance plan as in effect on the date of this Agreement, calculated on the basis of such Available Employee\'s salary in effect on the date of this Agreement. Such severance amount will not exceed per employee more than two weeks pay per year of service with a maximum of 26 weeks and a minimum of 4 weeks, in addition to associated payroll Taxes, calculated on the basis of such Available Employee\'s salary in effect on the date of this Agreement. 

    

 (iii) All offers of employment by Plains or an Affiliate of Plains contemplated in this Section 6(c) shall be expressly conditioned upon the Closing occurring. 

  

 (iv) Nothing in this Section 6(c) or elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Plan of Merger is intended to confer upon any past, present or future employee of any Link Party or ERISA Affiliate thereof or his or her legal representatives, any rights as a third party beneficiary or 

  

    
  

otherwise or any other rights or remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement or the Plan of Merger or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including without limitation, any rights of
employment, continued employment, or any rights under or with respect to any
welfare benefit, pension or other fringe benefits plan, program or
arrangement. Nothing contained in this Agreement or in the Plan of Merger
shall restrict in any way the right of Plains or any Affiliate of Plains, in
its sole discretion, to establish, amend or terminate any employee benefit
plan, arrangement, program, practice, policy or procedure. All rights and
obligations created by this Agreement are solely between the Parties hereto.

  

 (v) _Schedule 6(c)_ sets forth a list of each currently effective non-competition and confidentiality agreement with current or former employees of any Link Party. 

  

 (vi) Upon commencement of employment by Plains of the Available Employees, such Available Employees will be eligible for participation in all employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) and other benefit and compensation arrangements (including severance arrangements) or practices for which similarly situated employees of Plains or an Affiliate of Plains are eligible (" _Plains\' Plans_ "), in accordance with the terms of Plains\' Plans; _provided_ , that for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, such Available Employees (other than, with respect to vesting under any severance arrangement, the Specified Available Employees) will receive credit under Plains\' Plans for their period of employment with any Link Party (" _Past Service_ "), to the extent such Past Service was recognized by such Link Party under the comparable Link Party employee benefit plan. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under any Plains Party\'s severance plan for the period commencing one year after the Closing Date, such Available Employees (other than, with respect to vesting, the Specified Available Employees) will receive credit under such severance plan for Past Service, to the extent such Past Service was recognized by such Link Party under such Link Party\'s severance plan. Upon employment with Plains or an Affiliate of Plains, Available Employees\' Past Service will be recognized for vacation eligibility under the vacation plan maintained by Plains or an Affiliate of Plains to the extent such Past Service was recognized under the applicable Link Party\'s vacation plan. 

  

 (vii) As between the Link Parties and the Plains Parties, and as to the Available Employees who become employees of Plains or an Affiliate of Plains, the Link Parties will be responsible for all workers compensation claims arising out of any injuries or diseases which occur prior to their employment commencement date with Plains or an Affiliate of Plains. Plains shall be responsible for all workers compensation injuries and diseases which occur after their employment commencement date with Plains or an Affiliate of Plains.
