Sellers pursuant to the Operations Settlement shall be incorporated into the

service at the Hotels for periods after the Transfer Time and shall take any
other action and make any other payments required to assure uninterrupted

Operations Settlement. Other Revenues for the night prior to the Closing Date
shall belong solely to Seller.   (b) Buyer will honor, for its account, the
terms and rates of all pre-closing reservations confirmed by Sellers or
Managers for dates after the Closing Date. Buyer    17   authorizes
Sellers and Managers to continue to accept reservations for periods after the
Closing in the ordinary course of Sellers\' or Managers\' business. Buyer
recognizes that such reservations may include discounts or other
benefits provided in the ordinary course of business, including, without
limitation, benefits under any awards programs, sports team, corporate,
government or group discounts, weekend discounts or requirements that
ancillary food, beverage or other benefits be delivered by Buyer to the
guest(s) holding such reservations. Buyer agrees to honor all such

Sellers with respect to confirmed reservations for dates after the Closing
Date will be credited to Buyer at the Operations Settlement. Any post-closing
deposits received by Sellers with respect to confirmed reservations for dates
after the Closing Date will be forwarded to Buyer upon receipt.   Buyer

banquet facility and service agreements entered into in the ordinary course
of business which have been granted to groups, persons or other customers for
periods after the Closing Date at the rates and terms provided in such
agreements.   Buyer agrees that Sellers cannot make and have made no

which would be imposed on a newly constructed hotel by presently effective
federal, state and local building, plumbing, electrical, fire,
health, handicap, environmental and life safety laws, codes, ordinances,
rules, orders and/or regulations (collectively, the "building codes"). The
Hotels and other improvements on the Land may contain substances or materials
no longer permitted to be used in newly constructed buildings including,
without limitation, asbestos or other insulation materials, lead or other
paints, wiring, electrical, or plumbing materials and may not contain other
materials or equipment required to be installed in a newly constructed
building. Buyer has had the opportunity, as set forth in Section 11.04, to
conduct such investigations and inspections of the Property as Buyer deemed
necessary with respect to all such matters. Buyer agrees to accept and shall

assume the risk of noncompliance of the Property with all such building
codes. Except with respect to those representations set forth in Section 6
hereof, Buyer waives any right to excuse (except as set forth in Section
11.04 below) or delay performance of its obligations under this Agreement or
to assert any claim against Sellers (before or after Closing) arising out of
any failure of the Property to comply with any such building codes.  
Except with respect to those representations set forth in Section 6 hereof,
it is specifically understood and agreed by Sellers and Buyer that Sellers do
not make, and shall not be deemed to have made, any representation, warranty
or covenant with respect to (i) any Environmental Laws that may affect any of
the Property or (ii) the presence or absence of any Hazardous or
Toxic Substances in, on, above, under or about any of the Property. As used
in this Section 7.04, (A) the term "Environmental Laws" means all federal,
State and local laws, codes, ordinances, rules, orders and regulations now or
hereafter in effect relating to pollution or the protection of the
environment, including without limitation, all laws, codes, ordinances,
rules, orders and regulations governing the generation, use, collection,
treatment, storage, transportation, recovery, removal, discharge, spill or
disposal of any or all Hazardous or Toxic Substances, and (B) the term
"Hazardous Substances" or "Toxic Substances" means materials and substances
defined as "hazardous substances", "hazardous wastes", "toxic substances" or
"toxic wastes" in (I) the    22   Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. Sections 9601-9675, as
amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1988, and any
further amendments thereto and rules, orders and regulations thereunder; (II)
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C. Sections
6901-6992, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984,
and any further amendments thereto and rules, orders and regulations
thereunder; or (III) any other Environmental Laws.   It is understood and
agreed by Sellers and Buyer that in the event of any conflict between the
terms and provisions of this Section 7.04 and any other term or provision to
this Agreement, the relevant term or provision of this Section 7.04 shall
control and govern. The provisions of this Section 7.04 shall survive
Closing.   ARTICLE VIII.  REMEDIES   Section 8.01. Seller\'s Remedies. If
Buyer defaults under any provision of this Agreement before the Closing,
Buyer and Sellers agree that the damages that Sellers will sustain as a
result thereof will be substantial, but the actual damages will be difficult
or impossible to ascertain. Accordingly, Buyer and Sellers agree that, in the
event of Buyer\'s default, Sellers may, as their sole and exclusive remedies,
terminate this Agreement by written notice to Buyer in which event Sellers
shall receive the Deposit as liquidated damages for such default, the amount
of which Deposit Buyer and Sellers agree is not punitive or a penalty but is
just, fair and reasonable, and the Escrow Agent shall immediately pay the
Deposit to Sellers.   Section 8.02. Buyer\'s Remedies. In the event of a
default hereunder on the part of any Seller, Buyer\'s sole and exclusive
remedies hereunder shall be either: (1) the right to terminate this Agreement
and receive a return of the full amount of the Deposit, plus interest
thereon; or (2) the right to seek specific performance hereof, provided that
Buyer must file a suit for specific performance in the appropriate
jurisdiction within ninety (90) days from the date of such default by such
Seller.   The parties waive all damages and remedies for defaults prior
to Closing except as provided in this Agreement.   Section 8.03. Post-
Closing Matters. Notwithstanding the terms and provisions of Sections 8.01
and 8.02 or any other term or provision of this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer
shall each retain the right to seek and obtain relief for events occurring
after the Closing Date provided that: (a) this transaction in fact closes;
(b) the obligations for which relief is sought are obligations which by their
express terms are to survive Closing or which by their express terms are to
performed following Closing (including any indemnities hereunder, if any);

including, without limitation, fire and any additional hazard insurance,
shall be cancelled by Sellers as of the Transfer Time, and any refunded
premiums shall be retained by Sellers. Buyer will be responsible for
acquiring and placing its own insurance in force from and after the Transfer
Time.    28    Section 13.02 Condemnation and Casualty. (a) If, before
the Closing, any Seller receives notice that any Hotel or Hotels and any
parcel or parcels comprising the Land are to be wholly condemned, or to be
condemned in such substantial part that the value of the portion of the

($50,000,000.00), or if one or more of the Hotels is wholly or partially
destroyed by fire or other casualty, or if so much of the Hotels is damaged
by fire or other casualty to the extent that the cost of repairing such
damage shall exceed Fifty Million and No/100 Dollars ($50,000,000.00) as
determined by the casualty insurer(s) insuring the Hotels, then, in any such
event, Buyer and each of the Sellers shall each have the right to terminate
this Agreement by delivering notice of termination in writing to the other
party within thirty (30) days after the receipt of notice of such
condemnation or casualty (but not later than the Closing Date) (which notice
will, to the extent then known, contain the amount of compensation offered
for such condemnation or the amount of insurance proceeds offered to be paid
on account of such casualty, as the case may be) and upon giving such notice
of termination the Deposit shall be returned by the Escrow Agent to Buyer,
and Sellers and Buyer shall each be released and discharged from any further
obligation to each other hereunder except for those which expressly survive
the termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that if neither Buyer
nor Sellers elects to terminate this Agreement, the purchase contemplated
herein shall be consummated without reduction of the Purchase Price, within
the later of (i) fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such thirty (30)
day period or (ii) the Closing Date, but Buyer shall be entitled to all
proceeds of fire or other casualty insurance or condemnation (other than
proceeds relating to business interruption or loss for periods prior to the
Transfer Time), Buyer shall receive a credit to the Purchase Price for any
deductibles with respect to any insurance proceeds and Sellers shall have
no responsibility for the restoration and repair of the Property.   (b) If,
before the Closing, any one or more Hotel is damaged by fire or other

be less than an amount equal to Fifty Million and No/100
Dollars ($50,000,000.00), or if any Seller receives notice that any Hotel
and/or Land is to be partially condemned but that the value of the Land and
Hotels to be condemned does not exceed Fifty Million and No/100 Dollars
($50,000,000.00), then, and in any such event, the Closing shall proceed as

The section headings of this Agreement are for reference only and shall not
be used to construe or interpret this Agreement. All terms and words used in
this Agreement, regardless of the number or gender in which they are used,
shall be deemed to include any other number and any other gender as the
context may require. If any term or condition of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance shall, to any extent, be
held legally invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and
the application of such terms or conditions to persons or circumstances other
than those as to    31   which it is held legally invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby and each term and condition of
this Agreement shall be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
Section 14.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the state of Florida; provided, however, that with respect to matters that
relate to a specific portion of the Property, then this Agreement shall
be governed by the laws of the state where such Property is located.  
Section 14.12 Disclosure of Confidential Information/ Public Announcements/
Communication with Governmental Authorities/ Communication with Employees.
(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the existence of this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement and any other information disclosed in
the due diligence materials delivered to or produced by Buyer or any
other documents, materials, data or other information with respect to the
Property which is not generally known to the public (the "Confidential
Information") shall in all respects remain confidential and shall not be
disclosed by the Buyer except as provided herein. Buyer may disclose
Confidential Information to officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
accountants, consultants, lenders, financial advisors, partners and investors
(collectively, "Representatives"), who in the reasonable business judgment of
such party, need to know the Confidential Information for the purpose of
evaluating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer will inform
its Representatives of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement,
and such Representatives shall agree to be bound by the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, before Buyer may disclose any Confidential Information to
its Representatives. The disclosure of any Confidential Information by any
Representative in breach of this Agreement will constitute a breach of this
Agreement by Buyer, for which Buyer will be liable. If Buyer or any of its
Representatives is required by any subpoena, interrogatories, request for
production, or other legal process or by any applicable law or regulation to
disclose any Confidential Information, Buyer will give (to the extent not
prohibited by law) Sellers prompt written notice of the requirement and will
cooperate with the Sellers so that Sellers, at their expense, may seek an
appropriate protective order. In the absence of a protective order, Buyer and
its Representatives may disclose only such Confidential Information as may in
Buyer\'s reasonable opinion, be necessary to avoid any penalty, sanction, or
other material adverse consequence, and Buyer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to secure confidential treatment of any Confidential
Information so disclosed.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any party
hereto shall have the right to make a public announcement regarding the
transaction described in this Agreement, provided, however, that, prior to
and as a condition precedent to such public announcement, all other parties
hereto shall approve the timing, form and substance of any such public
announcement, except if a party hereto is required to make a public
announcement under any securities law, the party making such public
announcement may do so only after having provided the other party with a copy
of such public announcement and only as long as such public announcement is
made in strict accordance with the applicable law requiring such public
announcement be made.   (c) Without limiting the generality of the
provisions in subsection (a) above, Buyer shall not, through its officers,
employees, managers, contractors, consultants, agents, representatives or any
other person (including, without limitation, Buyer\'s third party
consultants), directly or indirectly, communicate with any governmental
authority or any official,    32   employee or representative thereof,
involving any matter with respect to the Property without the Sellers\' prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, unless
such communication is arranged by the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer and its representatives and consultants shall have the right to review
building department, health department and other local governmental authority
records with respect to the Property and the operation of the Hotels and
request written or verbal confirmation of zoning and any other compliance by
the Land or Hotels with any applicable laws, without any requirement to
obtain the consent of the Sellers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall
have the right to communicate with the applicable governmental authority in
connection with the issuance of any liquor licenses required for the sale of
liquor at the Hotels, and any and all other permits or licenses required to
be transferred or applied for in connection with the sale of the Hotels, all
without the prior consent of the Sellers; provided, however, that (i) Buyer
shall provide Sellers with regular updates regarding the progress of any and
all such communications; and (ii) no inspections of the Hotels by
the applicable governmental authorities shall occur unless a representative
of the Sellers is present during such inspections.   (d) Liquor Licenses.
To the extent transferable, Sellers shall transfer to Buyer or its designee,
or cause to be transferred to Buyer or its designee, all liquor licenses and
alcoholic beverage licenses which are necessary to operate the restaurant,
bars and lounges presently located within the Hotel located in Crystal City,
Virginia (the "Crystal City Hotel") and held in the name of Sellers (and not
the Manager). To that end, Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate each
with the other, and each shall execute such transfer forms, license
applications and other documents as may be necessary to effect such transfer.
The parties shall use good faith efforts to effect such transfer prior to
Closing. If permitted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, the
parties shall execute and file all necessary transfer forms, applications and
papers with the appropriate liquor and alcoholic beverage authorities
prior to Closing, to the end that the transfer shall take effect, if
possible, on the Closing Date, simultaneously with Closing. If not so
permitted, then the parties agree each with the other that they will promptly
execute all transfer forms, applications and other documents required by the
appropriate liquor and alcoholic beverage authorities in order to effect such
transfer at the earliest date in time possible consistent with the laws of
the Commonwealth of Virginia, in order that all liquor licenses may be
transferred from Sellers to Buyer or its designee at the earliest possible
time. If under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, such licenses cannot
be transferred or otherwise will not be transferred until after Closing, then
Sellers covenant and agree that Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer
in keeping open the bars and lounges and liquor facilities of the Crystal
City Hotel between the Closing Date and the time when such liquor license
transfers actually become effective, by causing the current Manager of such
facilities to continue exercising supervision and management under Sellers\'
licenses pursuant to a written agreement in the substantially the form
attached hereto as EXHIBIT "O" until such time as Buyer obtains licenses for
such facilities, but in any event not later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date (at which time such written agreement shall terminate);
provided, however, that Buyer, at Buyer\'s cost and expense, shall maintain
in force and effect at all times insurance reasonably acceptable to Sellers
(with Sellers as additional named insureds) and shall indemnify and hold
Sellers harmless from any liability, damages or claims encountered in
connection with such operations during said period of time, except for
Sellers\' gross negligence or willful misconduct and no employees of said
facilities shall be employees of any Seller. All cost and expense of
such operations during said period of time shall be the sole responsibility
of and be promptly paid by Buyer. Buyer    33   covenants and agrees
that upon the filing of all necessary transfer forms, applications and other
documents with the appropriate liquor and alcoholic beverage authorities,
Buyer will diligently and in good faith prosecute the transfer of the liquor
licenses to completion.   (e) Communication with Employees. Without limiting
the generality of the provisions in subsection (a) above, Buyer shall not,
through its officers, employees, managers, contractors, consultants, agents,
representatives or any other person (including, without limitation, Buyer\'s
third party consultants), directly or indirectly, communicate with any
Employees or any person representing any Employees involving any matter with
respect to the Property, the Employees or this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of Sellers and Managers, which consent may be withheld in the
sole discretion of Sellers and Managers, unless such communication is
arranged by the Sellers and/or Managers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Sellers shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer in order to arrange
communications, pursuant to a schedule to be reasonably agreed upon by the
parties in order to allow Buyer to interview the Employees for possible
continued employment, and Buyer shall apprise the Sellers from time to time
as to its plans for communicating with such Employees, and to complete such
communications in advance of the Closing.   Section 14.13 Time of Essence.
Time is of the essence of this Agreement and each term and provision hereof;
provided, however (unless specifically provided to the contrary elsewhere in
this Agreement), when the date by which any action, event or condition is to
occur or any notice or other communication is to be given falls on a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the date by which such action, event or
condition is to occur or such notice or other communication is to be given
shall be automatically extended to the business day immediately succeeding
such Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered as of the date first above
written.     [SIGNATURES ON FOLLOWING PAGE]    34    BUYER:
