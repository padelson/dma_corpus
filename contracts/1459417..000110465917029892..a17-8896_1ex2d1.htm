Seller/s may owe to the Purchaser as a result of any claim by the Purchaser in
terms of this Agreement which has not been settled in full from the Escrow
Amount or by the Sellers directly in cash. If any dispute arises between the
Sellers Representative and the Purchaser concerning the Purchasers set off
of any Earn Out Amount (or portion thereof) against any amount the Purchaser
alleges is owed to it by the Sellers, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Purchaser shall deliver eighty percent (80%) of such portion of
any Earn Out Amount in dispute to the Escrow Agent to be held in accordance

amounts held pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement shall be payable
only to the Sellers excluding DiGame (which shall not be entitled to payment
of any amount from the Escrow Agreement in any circumstance) in accordance

the Purchaser and shall be payable to DiGame only to the extent all or any
portion of such amount is finally determined to be payable to DiGame in
accordance with a written agreement of the Parties resolving such dispute or a
final determination of such dispute in accordance with this Agreement.

7.1.1. the calculation of the Purchase Price in accordance with clause 6.2;

 



 

7.1.2. a true and complete schedule of the Company Transaction Costs, with a
detailed breakdown and itemisation of their composition and amounts and the

item for PAYE for employees, one line item for VAT, one line item for skills
development levies, etc).

 



 

The Estimated Closing Statement shall be based upon the Final 2016 Unaudited
Accounts and Final Management Accounts for the Interim Period and the books
and records of the Group during the Interim Period. The content of the
Estimated Closing Statement and the components thereof shall be reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser. The Company shall provide reasonable access to the
appropriate personnel and financial books and records of the Group and its
representatives, as well as any additional relevant information and work
papers as the Purchaser may reasonably request, to enable the Purchaser to
properly evaluate the Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

7.2. If the Purchaser disputes the portion of the Purchase Price referred to
in clause 6.2 as reflected in the Estimated Closing Statement and/or the basis
of calculation of any one or more components thereof in writing by notice to
the Sellers Representative, the dispute shall be resolved or determined in
accordance with clauses 9 and 19 after the Closing Date, unless the amount in
dispute exceeds R5,000,000 (five million rand) and concerns a matter referred
to in clause 7.1.3 or clause 7.1.4, in which case the Closing Date shall be
deferred to the first Business Day following resolution and/or determination
of such dispute; provided that the Closing shall not occur within the last
forty-five (45) days of any fiscal quarter of 2U (in which case, the Closing
Date shall be deferred to the first Business Day of the next fiscal quarter of
2U). If the Purchaser does not dispute same before the Closing, such failure
to raise a dispute shall in no way affect the Purchasers right to raise a
dispute after the Closing and/or to claim any amount from the Sellers in terms
of this Agreement.

 



 

7.3. At 09h00 on the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall, subject to clause 7.6,

Price determined on the Closing Date in accordance with clause 6.2 shall be

7.3.2. the remaining portion of the amount received by Webber Wentzel from ENS
Africa on the Closing Date in accordance with clause 7.3, shall be delivered
to the Sellers (other than DiGame), in accordance with their respective
Sellers Escrow Proportions.

 



 

For all purposes of this Agreement, payment of any amount by the Purchaser to
ENS Africa and by ENS Africa to Webber Wentzel in terms of this Agreement
shall fully and finally discharge the obligation of the Purchaser to make
payment of such amount to the Sellers for all purposes of this Agreement.
Neither the Purchaser nor ENS Africa shall be responsible for the payment by
Webber Wentzel of any amount received by Webber Wentzel from ENS Africa to any
Seller, nor shall it be liable for any non-payment or late payment by Webber
Wentzel. The Sellers and Webber Wentzel are responsible for ensuring that all
amounts paid by the Purchaser to ENS Africa and by ENS Africa to Webber
Wentzel in terms of this Agreement are allocated between the Sellers, and
neither the Purchaser nor ENS Africa shall have any liability in this regard.

adjustment to the Purchase Price, indemnification, claim for breach of

Release Amount** "), shall be released for benefit of the Sellers (other than
DiGame) no later than the fifteenth (15th) Business Day following such Escrow
Release Date (each, an " **Escrow Payment Date** "). On each Escrow Payment

value is determined with reference to 2Us common stock in lieu of RSU Awards.
All such equity awards will be subject to other terms and conditions
(including, without limitation, vesting conditions to be contained in the
incentive plan document and applicable award agreements).

 



 

11.1.4. Upon finalisation of such equity incentive plan by no later than (30)
thirty days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall procure that those
persons named in Annexure J shall be granted equity awards according to and
subject to the terms of such equity incentive plan and applicable Award
Agreements, on the basis set out in this clause 11 and in Annexure J (subject

law, including without limitation, South African exchange control laws,
regulations and practise).

 



 

11.1.5. In addition to those persons named in Annexure J, the Purchaser shall
procure that an additional 35 employees of the Group (such list of employees
to be

any other award whose value is determined with reference to 2Us common stock,
as determined in the sole discretion of the Purchaser, to a value, per person,
of USD25,000 (the " **Additional Equity Awards** "). The Additional Equity
Awards shall vest over a four year period after the grant date and shall
otherwise be granted in accordance with the applicable provisions of clauses
11.1.1 to 11.1.4. On 1 April of each year, from 2018, such persons (if there

clause 12 which is contingent only, then the Sellers shall not be under any
obligation to make any payment pursuant to such claim until such time as the

Annexure B and on the basis that such warranties are or will be (as the case
may be) correct on the various dates specified in Annexure B or elsewhere in
this Agreement.

 



 

14.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(save for clause 14.8), the warranties given by the Sellers in this Agreement
and in Annexure B are qualified and limited:

 



 

14.6.1. by the express provisions of this Agreement;

 



 

14.6.2. by any matter that has been Fairly Disclosed in the Data Room.

 



      
 

 



 

14.7. No act which is required to be taken by the Sellers or any Group Company
for the purpose of implementing the Transaction or the Transaction Agreements
shall by itself be deemed to cause a breach of a warranty.

 



 

14.8. Any disclosures made to the Purchaser in the course of the due diligence
conducted by the Purchaser shall not in any way limit the warranties given to
the Purchaser hereunder, except if they fall within clause 14.6.1 or clause
14.6.2.

 



 

14.9. The remedies of the Purchaser in respect of a breach of any warranty
shall not be affected or limited by any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Purchaser concerning the Company or the Group or because the Purchaser may
have or have had actual knowledge of facts that would constitute a breach of
any particular warranty, as the intention of the parties is that the risk of
all matters warranted (subject to clause 14.6) is to be borne by the Sellers,
the Purchaser not being prepared to accept such risks.

 



 

14.10. The Sellers shall not be entitled to any claim against the Company or
any member of the Group or any of their directors or prescribed officers or
others who furnished information for the purposes of the warranties given by
the Sellers (this constituting a _stipulatio alteri_ in their favour capable
of acceptance at any time), notwithstanding that same may have been prepared
or provided negligently.

 



 

14.11. The Purchaser shall procure that three copies be made on USB flash
drive, in read only format, of the information and documentation contained in
the Data Room as at the Signature Date, certifying in writing to the Sellers
that the contents of the three USB flash drives reflect the same information
and documentation in the Data Room as at the Signature Date. Within 10
Business Days after the Signature Date, the Purchaser shall deliver one copy
thereof to the Sellers Representative, who shall verify the contents of the
USB flash drive delivered to him and the USB flash drive shall be deemed to
contain the same information and documentation in the Data Room as at the
Signature Date unless same is disputed by the Sellers Representative within
seven days after the delivery of the USB flash drive to him. Should the
Sellers Representative notify the Purchaser within seven days after delivery
of the USB flash drive to him that the contents of the USB flash drive do not
reflect the same information and documentation in the Data Room as at the
Signature Date, the Purchaser shall be obliged, as soon as possible after such
date, to rectify the contents of all the USB flash drives to reflect the same
information and documentation listed in the Data Room Index. ENS Africa shall
hold such (updated, if relevant) USB flash drives in escrow until the expiry
of the time period provided for in clause 14.12.2.

this Agreement (ii) rights to any accrued but unpaid compensation owed by the
members of the Group to relevant Sellers who are employees of the Group as of

Agreement) shall be entitled to require the Indemnifying Sellers to give
reasonable security for the payment of such costs prior to taking any steps to
contest the Indemnified Claim. If the parties are unable to agree upon the

available to the Sellers Representative, books and records relevant thereto
and any employees of the Group who are relevant witnesses provided that that
does not unduly interfere with their employment. Save as expressly provided in
this clause 15 the Purchaser will not be obliged to procure that the Group
contests an Indemnified Claim.

 



 

15.7. Subject to the limitations set out in this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of an Indemnified Claim
forthwith after receipt of the notification referred to in clause 15.3 unless
the Sellers Representative contests the Indemnified Claim in terms of clause
15.4 in which case the Indemnifying Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser the
amount of the Indemnified Claim forthwith after any final judgment or order is
granted against the relevant member of the Group; provided that in those
circumstances where,

 



 

15.7.1. a claim is contested and despite such contest the claim is payable in
law, the Indemnifying Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser the amount of the
claim as soon as it is payable;

 



 

15.7.2. the Sellers Representative does not proceed with the contest of the
claim promptly, the Purchaser shall be entitled to require the Indemnifying
Sellers either to pay the amount of the claim in question in trust to the
outside legal counsel of the Company pending the outcome of the contest or the

constitutes a _stipulatio alteri_.

or in terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Amount and the Earn Out Amount, if
any, shall be available, and Purchaser shall be entitled to use such amounts,

Sellers undertake that neither they nor any company, close corporation, firm,
trust, undertaking or concern in or by which they are directly or indirectly
interested, engaged, concerned or employed will in the Prescribed Areas for a

18.6.3. are fair and reasonable as between the Sellers on the one hand and the

whole or any part of its business to any other person, be transferable insofar
as concerns that member of the Group by the Purchaser or the Company, as the

favour of such person, without ceasing to bind the Sellers to the Purchaser.

 



 

18.9. The Sellers acknowledge that the Purchaser and the Group will suffer
financial harm and loss if they breach any provisions of this restraint. Upon
any such breach, either the Purchaser or any member of the Group shall be
entitled to enforce the restraint in question.

member of the Group, the benefits of which are capable of acceptance at any
time.

each of the Sellers on their own. In addition, such provisions apply also to
any one or more Sellers acting together.

 



 

18.12. The provisions of this clause 18 apply to the Covenantors as fully and
effectually as if they were Sellers for purposes of this clause 18 and as if
all references in this clause 18 to the Sellers were references to the
Covenantors.
