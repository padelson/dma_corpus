                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

      This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement") is entered into as of

(the "Buyer"), Aquarius Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), Speedera

purposes of Section 1.14 hereof and carrying out its resulting responsibilities
hereunder as representative of the Company Stockholders, the Management
Participants and the holders of Options, the Representative specified in Article

Adjusted Total Company Shares.

            (b)   Each Outstanding Series A Preferred Share shall be converted

<PAGE>

distribution to the Company Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.8 the
remainder of such Adjusted Buyer Common Shares, subject to the provisions of
Section 1.10, not deposited into escrow.

                  (iii) On the date which is 18 months after Closing Date and is
before the payment on any claims under the Escrow Agreement, the Buyer shall (A)
deposit into escrow pursuant to Section 1.13 the Indemnification Escrow
Percentage of the Option Adjusted Buyer Common Shares, rounded up to the nearest
whole number, which shares shall be designated as Indemnification Escrow Shares,
and (B) deliver to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Company
Stockholders in accordance with Section 1.8 the remainder of such Option
Adjusted Buyer Common Shares, subject to the provisions of Section 1.10, not

            (e)   Each Company Share held in the Company's treasury immediately
prior to the Effective Time and each Company Share owned beneficially by the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary shall be cancelled and retired without
payment of any consideration therefor.

            (f)   Each share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective

$0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

            (g)   Each Preferred Warrant outstanding and not exercised as of the
Effective Time shall be converted into a warrant to acquire such number of
shares of Buyer Common Shares equal to the number of shares of Buyer Common
Shares that would be issusable pursuant to Section 1.5(b), if the warrant were
exercised immediately before the Effective Time for Preferred Shares. The
exercise price per Buyer Common Share shall equal the aggregate exercise price
of such warrant divided by the number of Buyer Common Shares subject to such
Preferred Warrants. The aggregate Option Value of the Preferred Warrants
outstanding and not exercised as of the Effective Time (whether vested or
exercisable) shall be added to the Preferred Consideration for all purposes of
this Agreement.

      1.6   Management Shares.

            (a)   Each member of the Company's management named in Schedule I
attached hereto (each a "Management Participant" and collectively the
"Management Participants") shall have the right to receive as of the Effective
Time (subject to Sections 1.13 and 1.6(b)) the number of Buyer Common Shares
which have a Market Value equal to the excess, if any, of (x) such Management
Participant's Bonus Pool Percentage of the Bonus Pool minus, (y) such Management
Participant's Stockholder Payment (the "Management Shares"), it being understood
that such calculation is dependent on the Common Conversion Ratio which is
dependent on the definition of Management Shares and is an iterative
calculation.

            (b)   Of the Management Shares which each Management Participant
shall have the right to receive as of the Effective Time pursuant to Section
1.6(a):

                  (i)   On the Closing Date the Buyer shall (A) deposit with the
Escrow Agent the Indemnification Escrow Percentage of such Management Shares,
calculated using the Closing Common Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole number, which shares shall be designated as Indemnification Escrow Shares
and deposited in escrow pursuant to Section 1.13(a) and (B) deliver the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

remainder of such Management Shares, calculated using the Closing Common
Conversion Ratio, not deposited into escrow (the "Initial Management Shares") to
the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Management Participants in accordance
with 1.9.

                  (ii)  On the Asset Value Adjustment Date, if the Closing Net
Asset Value Adjustment is positive, the Buyer shall (A) deposit with the Escrow
Agent the Indemnification Escrow Percentage of such Management Shares,
calculated using the Adjusted Common Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest
whole number, which shares shall be designated as Indemnification Escrow Shares
and deposited in escrow pursuant to Section 1.13(a), and (B) deliver the
remainder of such Management Shares not deposited into escrow to the Exchange
Agent for distribution to the Management Participants in accordance with 1.9; in
each case, less any Management Shares delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Management Participants, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i).

                  (iii) On the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date,
the Buyer shall (A) deposit with the Escrow Agent the Indemnification Escrow
Percentage of any Management Shares not delivered pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i)
or 1.6(b)(ii), rounded up to the nearest whole number, which shares shall be
designated as Indemnification Escrow Shares and deposited in escrow pursuant to
Section 1.13(a), and (B) deliver the remainder of any such Management Shares not
deposited into escrow (or delivered to the Management Participants pursuant to
Sections 1.6(b)(i) or 1.6(b)(ii)) to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the
Management Participants in accordance with Section 1.9; provided, however, that
if any Management Participant has received (or has had deposited into Escrow)
Buyer Common Shares pursuant to this Section 1.6(b) which exceeds such
Management Participants' Management Shares, the Management Participant shall
promptly return any such excess shares to the Buyer.

      1.7   Dissenting Shares.

            (a)   Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Buyer Common Shares, unless the Company Stockholder holding
such Dissenting Shares shall have forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal
under each of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the California
Corporations Code or properly withdrawn, his, her or its demand for appraisal.
If such Company Stockholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right
to appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then as of the occurrence of such event, such
holder's Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be
converted into and represent the right to receive the Buyer Common Shares
issuable in respect of such Company Shares pursuant to Section 1.5, which Buyer
Common Shares shall be either deposited with the Escrow Agent or distributed to
the Company Stockholder holding Dissenting Shares as provided in Section 1.5(d).

            (b)   The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any Company Shares, withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the Delaware General Corporation Law or
the California Corporations Code, as applicable. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Buyer, make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal of Company Shares or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.

      1.8   Exchange of Shares.

Exchange Agent to establish a reserve account for the distribution of

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

certificates representing the Initial Merger Shares issuable to the Company
Stockholders, as described in Section 1.5, and cash for any fractional shares as
described in Section 1.10 (the "Exchange Fund"). Within five (5) business days
after the Effective Time, provided that the Company has delivered to the Buyer
at least five (5) business days prior to the Effective Time a list setting forth
(i) the name of each holder of a Certificate, (ii) the mailing address of each
such holder, (iii) the number of Company Shares represented by each Certificate
held by each holder prior to the Effective Time and (iv) the total number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock represented by such Certificate following the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to send to each holder
of a Certificate a notice and a transmittal in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange Agent such Certificate in
exchange for the Initial Merger Shares issuable to such holder pursuant to
Section 1.5. Each holder of a Certificate, upon proper surrender thereof to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the instructions in such notice, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor (subject to any Taxes required to be
withheld) the Initial Merger Shares issuable pursuant to Section 1.5 plus cash
in lieu of any fractional shares, as provided in Section 1.10 below. The Buyer
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to distribute the Initial Merger Shares and
cash in lieu of fractional shares to such holder as soon as practicable after
receipt of such Certificate and such other documents required by such notice.
Until properly surrendered, each such Certificate shall be deemed for all
purposes to evidence only the right to receive a certificate for the Initial
Merger Shares issuable pursuant to Section 1.5. Holders of Certificates shall
not be entitled to receive certificates for the Initial Merger Shares to which
they would otherwise be entitled until such Certificates are properly
surrendered.

            (b)   If any Initial Merger Shares are to be issued in the name of a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of such
Initial Merger Shares that (i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
transferable, and shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by
appropriate stock powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii)
the person requesting such transfer shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other Taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent
nor any Party shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Initial
Merger Shares issuable to such holder pursuant to Section 1.5 that are delivered
to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws.

            (c)   In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Initial Merger
Shares issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to Section 1.5. The Exchange Agent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give the
Exchange Agent and the Buyer a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against the Exchange Agent or the Buyer with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

            (d)   No dividends or other distributions that are payable to the
holders of record of Buyer Common Shares as of a date on or after the Closing
Date shall be paid to former Company Stockholders entitled by reason of the
Merger to receive Initial Merger Shares until such holders surrender their
Certificates for certificates representing the Merger Shares. Upon such
surrender, the Buyer shall pay or deliver to the persons in whose name the
certificates representing such Initial Merger Shares are issued any dividends or
other distributions that are payable to the holders of record of Buyer Common
Shares as of a date on or after the Closing Date and which were paid or
delivered between the Effective Time and the time of such surrender; provided
that no such person shall be entitled to receive any interest on such dividends
or other distributions.

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

            (e)   By demand, at any time after the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Buyer may require that any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders or Management
Participants at such time shall be delivered to the Buyer and any Company
Stockholder or Management Participant who has not previously complied with this
Section 1.8 shall thereafter look only to the Buyer, as a general unsecured
creditor, for payment of its claim for Buyer Common Shares, any cash in lieu of
fractional Buyer Common Shares and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Buyer Common Shares.

            (f)   To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer,
the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Company Stockholder or any Management
Participant, as the case may be, for any Buyer Common Shares (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate or
required letter of transmittal shall not have been surrendered or delivered
prior to the third anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which any Buyer Common Shares, and any cash payable to any
Company Stockholder or Management Participant or any dividends or distributions
payable to the holder of such Buyer Common Shares pursuant to this Article I
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity),
any such Buyer Common Shares or cash, dividends or distributions in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
person previously entitled thereto.

      1.9   Issuance of Management Shares. The Buyer shall deliver instructions
to the Exchange Agent to distribute certificates representing the Management
Shares to the Management Participants, as described in Section 1.6(b). As soon
as practicable after the applicable date on which the Buyer is required to
deliver the Management Shares pursuant to Section 1.6(b), the Exchange Agent
shall deliver to the Management Participants the Management Shares issuable
pursuant to Section 1.6(b).

      1.10  Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
Merger Shares shall be issued to Company Stockholders upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such Company Stockholders shall not be entitled to
any voting rights, rights to receive any dividends or distributions or other
rights as a stockholder of the Buyer with respect to any fractional Merger
Shares that would have otherwise been issued to such Company Stockholders. In
lieu of any fractional Merger Shares that would have otherwise been issued, each
Company Stockholder that would have been entitled to receive a fractional Merger
Share shall, upon proper surrender of such person's Certificates, receive a cash
payment equal to the closing price of the Buyer Common Shares on the NASDAQ
Stock Market on the day immediately preceding the Closing multiplied by the
fraction of a share that such Company Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to
receive.

      1.11  Options and Warrants.

            (a)   As of the Effective Time, all Options, whether vested or
unvested, and the Option Plan, insofar as it relates to Options outstanding
under such Plan as of the Closing, shall be assumed by the Buyer. Immediately
after the Effective Time, each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under such Option at the Effective Time,
such number of Buyer Common Shares as is equal to the number of Common Shares
subject to the unexercised portion of such Option multiplied by the Common
Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be
rounded down to the nearest whole number) (each such Option an "Assumed
Option"). The exercise price per share of each Assumed Option shall be equal to
the exercise price of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by the Common Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).
The term, exercisability, vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock
option" under Section 422 of the

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

Code, if applicable, and all of the other terms of the Options shall otherwise
remain unchanged, except as provided in Section 1.11(f) below, and except that
by virtue of the Merger each Option shall be amended to the extent set forth in
Section 4 of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement with respect to the deposit of
Indemnification Escrow Shares and the forfeiture of unexercised portions of any
Assumed Options.

            (b)   Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its
Reasonable Best Efforts to obtain the agreement of each holder of a Warrant or
Preferred Warrant to exercise, no later than immediately prior to the Effective
Time, all vested Warrants and to terminate, as of such time, all unvested
Warrants. As of the Effective Time, all Warrants, whether vested or unvested,
not so exercised shall be assumed by the Buyer. Immediately after the Effective
Time, each Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
deemed to constitute a warrant to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such Warrant at the Effective Time, such number of shares
of Buyer Common Shares as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the
unexercised portion of such Warrant multiplied by the Common Conversion Ratio
(with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to be rounded down to the
nearest whole number) (each such Warrant an "Assumed Warrant"). The exercise
price per share of each such Assumed Warrant shall be equal to the exercise
price of such Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the
Common Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The term,
exercisability, vesting schedule, and all of the other terms of the Warrant
shall otherwise remain unchanged, except as provided in Section 1.11(f) below,
and except that by virtue of the Merger each Warrant shall be amended to the
extent set forth in Section 4 of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement with
respect to the deposit of Indemnification Escrow Shares and the forfeiture of
unexercised portions of any Assumed Warrants.

            (c)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Options and Warrants
appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to such Options
or Warrants, as applicable, as amended by this Section 1.11, and the agreements
evidencing such Options or Warrants, as applicable, and that such Options or
Warrants shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the amendments provided for in this Section 1.11, the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement and such notice).

            (d)   The Buyer shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Shares for delivery
upon exercise of the Options and Warrants assumed in accordance with this
Section 1.11. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than the date on which the Buyer has filed pursuant to Form 8-K the
financial statements required to be filed by the Buyer in connection with the
Merger pursuant to Regulation S-X of the Securities Act in connection with the
Merger, the Buyer shall file a Registration Statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) under the Securities Act with respect to all shares of Buyer
Common Shares subject to the Options that may be registered on a Form S-8, and
shall use its Reasonable Best Efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
Registration Statement for so long as such Options remain outstanding. The Buyer
Common Shares subject to the Warrants will be tradeable at such time as they
become eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

            (e)   The Company shall obtain, prior to the Closing, the consent
from each holder of an Option (other than holders of Options representing, in
the aggregate, less than 3% of the Total Company Shares) or a Warrant to the
amendment of such Option or Warrant pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement and Sections 1.11 and 1.13(a) and Article VI of this Agreement (unless
such consent is not required under the terms of the applicable agreement,
instrument or plan).

            (f)   Each Assumed Option and Assumed Warrant (collectively, the
"Assumed Convertible Securities" and individually an "Assumed Convertible
Security") shall be subject to the following provisions:

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

                  (i)   Upon the exercise of an Assumed Convertible Security
after the Closing Date and before the date which is 18 months after the Closing
Date, the Buyer shall (A) deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate representing
the Indemnification Escrow Percentage of the Buyer Common Shares acquired in
such exercise, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which shares shall be
designated as Indemnification Escrow Shares and deposited in escrow pursuant to
Section 1.13(a), and (B) deliver to the holder of such Assumed Convertible
Security a certificate representing the remainder of the Buyer Common Shares
acquired in such exercise and not deposited into escrow, which Buyer Common
Shares shall be considered Initial Merger Shares for all purposes of this
Agreement.

                  (ii)  At any time before the Asset Value Adjustment Date, each
Assumed Convertible Security shall (x) only be exercisable for a number of Buyer
Common Shares as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the
unexercised portion of such corresponding Option or Warrant multiplied by the
Closing Common Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such
multiplication to be rounded down to the nearest whole number) and (y) have an
exercise price per share equal to the exercise price of such corresponding
Option or Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the
Closing Common Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

                  (iii) On the Asset Value Adjustment Date, if the Closing Net
Asset Value Adjustment is positive, the Buyer shall with respect to each
Exercised Share (A) deposit into escrow pursuant to Section 1.13(a) the
Indemnification Escrow Percentage of the Adjusted Buyer Common Shares, rounded
up to the nearest whole number, which shares shall be designated as
Indemnification Escrow Shares, and (B) deliver to the person who exercised the
Assumed Convertible Security related to such Exercised Shares the remainder of
such Adjusted Buyer Common Shares not deposited into escrow.

                  (iv)  At any time after the Asset Value Adjustment Date and
before the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date, each Assumed
Convertible Security shall (x) only be exercisable for a number of Buyer Common
Shares as is equal to the number of Common Shares subject to the unexercised
portion of such corresponding Option or Warrant multiplied by the Adjusted
Common Conversion Ratio (with any fraction resulting from such multiplication to
be rounded down to the nearest whole number) and (y) have an exercise price per
share equal to the exercise price of such corresponding Option or Warrant
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by the Adjusted Common
Conversion Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

                  (v)   On the date which is 18 months after the Closing Date
and immediately before the payment of any claims under the Escrow Agreement, the
Buyer shall with respect to each Exercised Share (A) deposit into escrow
pursuant to Section 1.13(a) the Indemnification Escrow Percentage of the Option
Adjusted Buyer Common Shares, rounded up to the nearest whole number, which
shares shall be designated as Indemnification Escrow Shares, and (B) deliver to
the person who exercised the Assumed Convertible Security related to such
Exercised Shares the remainder of such Option Adjusted Buyer Common Shares not
deposited into escrow.

                  (vi)  Assumed Convertible Securities shall be amended to
reduce the number of Buyer Common Shares subject to the unexercised portion of
any Assumed Convertible Security by such Assumed Convertible Security's
percentage share of any Damages subject to indemnification, as follows:

                        (A)   Immediately prior to any distributions made
pursuant to Section 3 of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, each Assumed
Convertible Security shall be split into two securities, the "Escrow Assumed
Convertible Security" and the "Free Assumed Convertible Security". The Escrow
Assumed Convertible Security shall have an Option Merger Value equal to 15% of
the Option Merger Value of the Assumed Convertible Security, and the remaining
Assumed Convertible

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

Security shall be the Free Assumed Convertible Security, which shall no longer
be subject to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. If, after any forfeiture is
made pursuant to clause (B) below of the unexercised portion of such Escrow
Assumed Convertible Security attributable to Damages distributed to the Buyer in
respect of any claims for indemnification by the Buyer and/or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to Article VI or Article VIII hereof, the Escrow Assumed
Convertible Security has an Option Merger Value in excess of the 5% of the
Option Merger Value of the Assumed Convertible Security before any amounts in
respect of Damages were paid, then the Escrow Assumed Convertible Security shall
be reduced by the amount of such excess Option Merger Value and the Free Assumed
Convertible Security shall be increased by a like amount. If an Escrow Assumed
Convertible Security is exercised after the Initial Distribution Date, 100% of
the Buyer Common Shares acquired upon exercise of such option shall be deposited
into escrow and held in trust for the holder of such exercised Escrow Assumed
Convertible Security.

                        (B)   Upon any determination that the Buyer is entitled
to receive some or all of the Indemnification Escrow Shares through a
distribution in respect of Damages made pursuant to Section 3 of the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement, each holder of an Escrow Assumed Convertible
Security shall forfeit that amount of the unexercised portion of such Escrow
Assumed Convertible Security equal in value to such holder's "pro rata share" of
such Damages. Such holder's pro rata share of such Damages shall be determined
by dividing (x) the Option Merger Value of such holder's Escrow Assumed
Convertible Security immediately before the distribution in respect of Damages
is made by (y) the Aggregate Escrow Value immediately before such distribution
is made. Any forfeitures hereunder shall be applied against the Assumed
Convertible Security on a pro rata basis against the vested and unvested portion
of the Assumed Convertible Security.

      1.12  Adjustment Before and After the Closing. The Base Purchase Price
shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

            (a)   Not later than three business days prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a balance sheet of the
Company as of a date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet Date") within five
business days of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet"). The
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the
provisions relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet set forth in
this Section 1.12. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall be accompanied by
(i) all relevant backup materials and schedules, in detail reasonably acceptable
to the Buyer, and (ii) a statement setting forth the amount, if any, by which
the estimated Net Asset Value is greater than, or less than, the Target Amount
(the "Preliminary Net Asset Value"). In calculating the Preliminary Net Asset
Value, the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall include (A) as liabilities
the full amount of the transaction fees and expenses payable by the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including legal
and accounting fees, to the extent such transaction fees and expenses have not
been paid prior to the date of the Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet; and (B)
reserves in respect of Taxes due with respect to periods ending (or deemed to
end pursuant to Section 8.3(b) hereof) at or prior to the Effective Time
determined in accordance with GAAP. The Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet shall
be accompanied by a statement setting forth the calculations showing the basis
for the determination of such sums. If the Preliminary Net Asset Value on the
Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet is (i) greater than the Target Amount, then
the difference shall be added to the Base Purchase Price, or (ii) less than the
Target Amount, then the difference shall be deducted from the Base Purchase
Price (the Base Purchase Price, as so adjusted, is referred to as the
"Preliminary Base Purchase Price").

            (b)   Not later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, the
Buyer shall deliver to the Representative the Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently
with the Company's past practices (to the extent such past

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

practices are consistent with GAAP), except that the Closing Balance Sheet may
exclude all footnotes, subject to the adjustments set forth in this Section 1.12
(which shall be in addition to and not in lieu of those required by GAAP) and
shall be certified as such by the Buyer.

            (c)   The Closing Balance Sheet delivered pursuant to paragraph (a)
above shall be accompanied by (i) all relevant backup materials and schedules,
in detail reasonably acceptable to the Representative, and (ii) a statement
setting forth the amount, if any, by which the Net Asset Value (plus the amount
of Covered Costs in excess of the Cost Cap to be borne by the Buyer pursuant to
Section 10.1(g), if applicable) is greater than, or less than, the Preliminary
Net Asset Value. In calculating the Net Asset Value, the Closing Balance Sheet
shall include (A) as liabilities the full amount of the transaction fees and
expenses payable by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including legal and accounting fees, to the extent such
transaction fees and expenses were not paid prior to the Effective Time; and (B)
reserves in respect of Taxes due with respect to periods ending (or deemed to
end pursuant to Section 8.3(b) hereof) at or prior to the Effective Time
determined in accordance with GAAP. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be
accompanied by a statement setting forth the calculations showing the basis for
the determination of such sums.

            (d)   In the event that the Representative disputes the Closing
Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value Adjustment, the
Representative shall notify the Buyer in writing (the "Dispute Notice") of the
amount, nature and basis of such dispute, within 30 calendar days after delivery
of the Closing Balance Sheet. In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the
Representative shall first use his, her or its diligent good faith efforts to
resolve such dispute among themselves. If the Buyer and the Representative are
unable to resolve the dispute within 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Dispute Notice, then any remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm selected in writing by the
Representative and the Buyer or, if the Representative and the Buyer fail or
refuse to select a firm within 10 calendar days after written request therefor
by the Representative or the Buyer, such an independent nationally recognized
accounting firm shall be selected in accordance with the rules of the Boston,
Massachusetts office of the AAA (the "Neutral Accountant"). All determinations
pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the
Buyer and the Representative. The determination of the Neutral Accountant as to
the resolution of any dispute shall be binding and conclusive upon all Parties.
A judgment on the determination made by the Neutral Accountant pursuant to this
Section 1.12 may be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction
thereover.

            (e)   The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant in connection
with the resolution of disputes pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall be shared
equally by the Equity Holders, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other
hand; provided that if the Neutral Accountant determines that one such party has
adopted a position or positions with respect to the Closing Balance Sheet or the
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value Adjustment that is frivolous or
clearly without merit, the Neutral Accountant may, in its discretion, assign a
greater portion of any such fees and expenses to such party. Any such fees and
expenses that are the responsibility of the Equity Holders pursuant to this
paragraph (e) shall be funded from the Indemnification Escrow Shares.

            (f)   Immediately upon the expiration of the 30-day period for
giving the Dispute Notice, if no such notice is given, or upon notification by
the Representative to the Buyer, that no such notice will be given, or
immediately upon the resolution of disputes, if any, pursuant to this Section
1.12, the Preliminary Base Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows (as so
adjusted, the "Adjusted Base Purchase Price"):

                  (i)   If the Closing Net Asset Value Adjustment is negative,
such deficiency shall be deducted from the Preliminary Base Purchase Price to
obtain the Adjusted Base Purchase Price,

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

and the Buyer shall be entitled to recover such deficiency pursuant to the terms
of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement;

                  (ii)  If the Closing Net Asset Value Adjustment is zero, the
Adjusted Base Purchase Price shall be equal to the Preliminary Base Purchase
Price; and

                  (iii) If the Closing Net Asset Value Adjustment is positive,
such surplus shall be added to the Preliminary Base Purchase Price to obtain the
Adjusted Base Purchase Price, and the Buyer shall deliver to the Exchange Agent
Buyer Common Shares as provided in Section 1.5(d)(ii) hereof.

      1.13  Escrow Arrangements.

            (a)   On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent a certificate (issued in the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee)
representing the Indemnification Escrow Shares issuable pursuant to Sections
1.5(d) and 1.6(b)(i). The Indemnification Escrow Shares will be held in escrow
for the purpose of (i) providing security for any adjustment to the amount of
the Preliminary Base Purchase Price pursuant to Section 1.12 and (ii) securing
the indemnification obligations of the Equity Holders set forth in Section 6.1.
The Indemnification Escrow Shares shall be held by the Escrow Agent under the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The
Indemnification Escrow Shares shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be
subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process
of any creditor of any party, and shall be held and disbursed solely for the
purposes and in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement. Equity Holders shall have the right to receive cash dividends (in
conjunction with any general distribution of cash dividends made by the Buyer
with respect to all Buyer Common Shares) with respect to any issued
Indemnification Escrow Shares held on their behalf. The Representative shall
have the right to vote any issued Indemnification Escrow Shares by instructing
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement.

            (b)   The execution of this Agreement by the Representative and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company
Stockholders shall constitute approval of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement
and of all of the arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the
Indemnification Escrow Shares in escrow.

      1.14  Representative.

            (a)   In order to efficiently administer the transactions
contemplated hereby, including (i) the determination of the Net Asset Value and
Adjusted Base Purchase Price and (ii) the defense and/or settlement of any
claims for which the Equity Holders may be required to indemnify the Buyer
and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VI or Article VIII hereof,
the Company Stockholders, by the approval of the Merger and adoption of this
Agreement, the holders of Options or Warrants by executing amendments to such
Options or Warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Section 1.11(f) hereof, the
Principal Stockholders, by their execution of the Stockholder Agreement, and the
Management Participants, by their execution of the Management Participant
Agreement, shall each be deemed to have designated the Representative as their
representative.

            (b)   The Company Stockholders, by the approval of the Merger and
adoption of this Agreement, and the holders of Options or Warrants by executing
amendments to such Options or Warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Section
1.11(f) hereof, shall each be deemed to have authorized the Representative (i)
to make all decisions relating to the determination of the Net Asset Value and
the Adjusted Base Purchase Price, (ii) to take all action necessary in
connection with the defense and/or

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

settlement of any claims for which the Company Stockholders may be required to
indemnify the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VI or
Article VIII hereof, (iii) after the Effective Time, to give and receive all
notices required to be given under the Agreement, and (iv) to take any and all
additional action as is contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement to be taken by or on behalf of the Equity
Holders.

            (c) The Buyer shall be able to rely conclusively on the instructions
and decisions of the Representative as to the determination of the Net Asset
Value and the Adjusted Base Purchase Price, the settlement of any claims for
indemnification by the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Article VI or Article VIII hereof or any other actions required or contemplated
or permitted to be taken by the Representative hereunder, and no party shall
have any cause of action against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in
reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Representative.

            (d) The Representative will have the right to act as the
representative of the Equity Holders, and to act on behalf of the Equity Holders
and to take any and all actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Representative under this Agreement, with respect to any claims (including
payment thereof) made pursuant to Section 6.1 and with respect to any actions to
be taken by the Representative pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.
All decisions and actions by the Representative, including without limitation
any agreement between the Representative and the Buyer relating to the
determination of the Net Asset Value and the Adjusted Base Purchase Price or the
defense or settlement of any claims for which the Equity Holders may be required
to indemnify the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VI
or Article VIII hereof, shall be binding upon all of the Equity Holders, and no
Equity Holder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same.

            (e) The Representative (or any of the directors, officers, agents,
employees or Affiliates thereof) shall incur no liability to the Equity Holders
with respect to any action taken or suffered by the Representative in reliance
upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement, or other document
believed by the Representative to be genuinely and duly authorized, nor for any
other action or inaction with respect to distributions of the Indemnification
Escrow Shares, any defense or settlement of any claims, and the making of
payments with respect thereto, nor with respect to voting or failing to vote the
Indemnification Escrow Shares, except to the extent resulting from the
Representative's own willful misconduct or gross negligence. The Representative
may, in all questions arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of
counsel, and for anything done, omitted, or suffered in good faith by the
Representative in reliance on such advice, shall not be liable to the Equity
Holders.

            (f) In the event that the Representative dies or becomes unable to
perform his, her or its responsibilities as the Representative or resigns from
such position, Trinity Ventures shall appoint a new Representative, and if
within 30 days of such death, inability to perform his, her or its
responsibilities or resignation of the Representative, Trinity Ventures fails to
appoint a new Representative, the Equity Holders receiving an aggregate of
greater than 50% of the Adjusted Merger Consideration shall select another
representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted representative shall be
deemed to be the Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

            (g) The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
rely conclusively on a certificate from the Representative with respect to any
action taken by the Representative, and no party shall have any cause of action
against the Buyer for any action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon such a
certificate from the Representative.

            (h) The Company Stockholders, by the approval of the Merger and
adoption of this Agreement, and the holders of Options or Warrants by executing
amendments to such Options or Warrants, as applicable, pursuant to Section (a)
hereof, shall

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

each be deemed to (i) agree and authorize the Escrow Agent to withhold from the
Indemnification Escrow Shares, if any, otherwise payable to the Equity Holders
under the terms of the Indemnification Escrow Agreement a number of shares
having a value (using a price of $12.50 per share) equal to the reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable professional fees) incurred by, or reasonably
anticipated by the Representative to be incurred by, the Representative in
connection with the representation of the Equity Holders in any proceeding
arising out of this Agreement (including all matters concerning claims for
indemnification under Article VI or Article VIII of this Agreement) or the
transactions or agreements related hereto (the "Representative Fees"); (ii)
agree and authorize the Representative to withhold Buyer Common Shares (valued
at $12.50 per share) evidencing the Representative Fees from any shares
otherwise issuable to the Equity Holders pursuant to Section 1.12 hereof (to the
extent such fees are not withheld from the Escrow Shares); and (iii) agree to
reimburse the Representative for the Representative Fees.

            (i) The provisions of this Section 1.14 are independent and
severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be enforceable
notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Equity Holder may have in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Remedies
available at law for any breach of the provisions of this Section 1.14 are
inadequate; therefore, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
damages if either the Buyer and/or the Surviving Corporation brings an action to
enforce the provisions of this Section 1.14. The provisions of this Section 1.14
shall be binding upon the executors, heirs, legal representatives, personal
representatives, successors and permitted assigns of each Equity Holder, and any
references in this Agreement to a Equity Holder or the Equity Holders shall mean
and include the successors to the Equity Holder's rights hereunder, whether
pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or
otherwise.

      1.15 Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws

            (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time shall be the same as the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Transitory Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be
changed to the name of the Company and (ii) the identity of the incorporator
shall be deleted.

            (b) The By-laws of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time shall be the same as the By-laws of the Transitory Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the corporation
set forth therein shall be changed to the name of the Company.

      1.16 No Further Rights. From and after the Effective Time, no Company
Shares shall be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as provided herein or by
law.

      1.17 Closing of Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Company Shares shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for Initial Merger Shares in accordance with Section
1.5, subject to Section 1.12 and to applicable law in the case of Dissenting
Shares.

      1.18 Withholding Obligations. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to any provision of this Agreement to any Equity
Holders such amounts as it reasonably determines that it is required to deduct

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
other applicable U.S. or foreign law, rule or regulation. The Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall timely pay over such withheld
amounts to the appropriate Governmental Entity on behalf of the Equity Holders
from whom such amounts are withheld in accordance with the Code or such other
applicable U.S. or foreign law, rule, or regulation. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Equity Holders in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be. The Buyer shall also have the right to collect Forms W-8 or W-9, or such
other forms relating to United States federal withholding obligations as may be
applicable, from the Equity Holders. Each Equity Holder from whom the Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation is required to withhold shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates
from and against any and all Taxes (but, for the purposes of this Section 1.18,
the term "Taxes" shall not include any penalty or interest) incurred or suffered
by any of them as a result of or relating to the calculation or payment
(including without limitation any errors in the calculation or failure to make
any payment) of any amounts required to be withheld from such Equity Holder
and/or paid to any Governmental Entity in respect of payment of the Merger
Consideration or Management Shares to such Equity Holder or in respect of the
exercise of any Options or Warrants held by such Equity Holder and the payment
of the Option/Warrant Consideration in connection with the Merger.

liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
of the Company as of the date thereof and for the period referred to therein,
and is consistent with the books and records of the Company. The accruals for

Recent Balance Sheet and are adequate and properly reflect the expenses
associated therewith in accordance with GAAP. The Current India Financial
Statements fairly present the assets, liabilities, business, financial

effected by the Company since June 30, 2001. Section 2.6(d) of the Disclosure
Schedule lists all non-audit services performed by the Company's auditors for
the Company since June 30, 2001.

      2.7 Absence of Certain Changes. Since the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date,
(a) there has occurred no event or development which, individually or in the
aggregate, has had, or would, based on information then known to the Company,
reasonably be expected to have in the future, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
and (b) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any of the actions set
forth in paragraphs (a) through (t) of Section 4.5.

      2.8 Undisclosed Liabilities. The Company does not have any liability
(whether absolute or contingent, whether liquidated or unliquidated and whether

combined, unitary or similar Tax Returns, other than a group of which only the
Company and the Subsidiaries are or were members. Each of the Company and the
Subsidiaries has paid on a timely basis all Taxes that were due and payable
whether or not shown on any Tax Return. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date do not
exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the Most Recent Balance Sheet. All unpaid Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary attributable to periods commencing after the Most
Recent Balance Sheet Date arose in the Ordinary Course of Business and are
similar in nature and amount to Taxes which arose during the comparable period
of time in the immediate preceding fiscal year. All Taxes that the Company or

withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid to the proper
Governmental Entity.

all taxable periods commencing on or after June 30, 2001 (or such earlier
taxable periods with respect to which the applicable statute of limitations does
not preclude the assessment of additional Tax). The U.S. federal income Tax
Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary and the Tax Returns of the India
Subsidiary under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, have been audited by the
Internal Revenue Service or comparable Indian Governmental Entity or are closed
by the applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years through the
taxable year specified in Section 2.9(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. The Company
has delivered or made available to the Buyer complete and accurate copies of all
other Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries together with all related
examination reports and statements of deficiency for all periods for which the
applicable period for the assessment of the Tax has not been closed by any
applicable statute of limitations. No examination or audit of any Tax Return of
the Company or any Subsidiary by any Governmental Entity is currently in
progress or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated.
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been informed by any jurisdiction
that the jurisdiction believes that the Company or Subsidiary was required to
file any Tax Return that was not filed. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to an
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency.

has any actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than
the Company or any Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or

been required to make a basis reduction pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-20(b) or Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-2(b).

            (d) None of the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary: (i) is
"tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the Code; or
(ii) directly or indirectly secures any debt the interest on which is Tax exempt
under Section 103(a) of the Code.

            (e) There are no adjustments under Section 481 of the Code (or any
similar adjustments under any provision of the Code or the corresponding
foreign, state or local Tax laws) that are required to be taken into account by
the Company or any Subsidiary in any period ending after the Closing Date by
reason of a change in method of accounting in any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date.

            (f) Section 2.9(f) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth the amount

other credit, and excess charitable contribution allocable to the Company and
each Subsidiary as of the most recent practicable date.

an international boycott as defined in Section 999 of the Code.

stockholders or security holders stock or securities of a controlled
corporation, nor has stock or securities of the Company been distributed, in a
transaction to which Section 355 of the Code applies (i) in the two years prior
to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution that could otherwise
constitute part of a "plan" or "series of

                                      -19-

related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that

            (k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is a party to a gain

Work Permit. With respect to each Work Permit, all of the information that the
Company or any Subsidiary provided to the Department of Labor ("DOL") and the
Department of Homeland Security (collectively with its predecessor and
subsidiary entities, the "DOHS") in the applications for such Work Permit was,
to the knowledge of the Company, true and complete at the time of filing such
applications. The Company or applicable Subsidiary received the appropriate
notice of approval or other evidence of authorized employment from the DOHS, the
DOL, the Department of State or other relevant Governmental Entity with respect
to each such Work Permit. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received
any notice from the DOHS or any other Governmental Entity that any Work Permit
has been revoked. There is no action pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened to revoke or adversely modify the terms of any of the Work
Permits.

            (g) The Company and the Subsidiaries have obtained the necessary
prevailing wage documentation for each H-1B worker and has paid and continues to

Condition Applications for all H-1B workers and has maintained all documentation
required by the DOL regulations. The Company has provided the Buyer with a
written statement which summarizes the compliance of the Company with the DOL
regulations governing labor condition applications. Since December 1, 2004,
neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has incurred any liability under
the Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act (the "WARN Act") (29
U.S.C. Sections 2101, et seq.) or any similar state law or statute (such as
California Labor Code Section 1400 et seq.) and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not give rise to any such liability. Section 2.21(g) of the
Disclosure Schedule will set forth, as of the Closing, all employee actions that
could be aggregated with any employment action on or after the Closing to result
in any liability under such laws.

            (h) Except as set forth in Section 2.21(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule, there have been no federal or state or other claims based on sex,
sexual or other harassment, age, disability, race or other discrimination or
other claims, whether statutory or common law, including claims of wrongful
termination, by any Governmental Entity, employee or former employee or by any
individual who is or was performing work for the Company or any Subsidiary but
provided by an outside employment agency, and there are no facts or
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such complaint
or claim. The Company and each Subsidiary have complied with all legal
requirements related to the employment of employees including, without
limitation, any legal requirement relating to wages, hours, collective
bargaining, the payment of Social Security and similar Taxes, equal employment
opportunity,

                                      -28-

employment discrimination, employee health and safety (including without
limitation, those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1970 and similar state laws). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
received any notice of any claim that it has not complied with any legal
requirement, or that it is liable for any arrearages of wages or any Taxes or
penalties for failure to comply with any of the foregoing.

employee communications, (iv) all employee handbooks, employment manuals and

the Code or other federal law.

            (b) Each Company Plan has been administered in accordance with its
terms and each of the Company, the Subsidiaries and the ERISA Affiliates has met
its obligations with respect to each Company Plan and has timely made all
required contributions thereto. The Company, each ERISA Affiliate and each

and the Code and the regulations thereunder (including Section 4980B of the
Code, Subtitle K, Chapter 100 of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 and
Section 701 et seq. of ERISA). All filings and reports as to each Company Plan
required to have been submitted to the Internal Revenue Service or to the United
States Department of Labor have been timely submitted.

            (c) There are no Legal Proceedings (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of the Company Plans and proceedings with
respect to qualified domestic relations orders) against or involving any Company
Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Plan that
could give rise to any liability. No Company Plan is or within the last three
calendar years has been the subject of, or has received notice that it is the
subject of, examination by a government agency or a participant in a government
sponsored amnesty, voluntary compliance or similar program.

            (d) All the Company Plans that are intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code have received determination letters from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that such Company Plans are qualified and the
plans and the trusts related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under
Sections 401(a) and 501(a), respectively, of the Code, or, if reliance is
permitted under IRS Announcement 2001-77, the Company relies on the favorable
opinion letter or advisory letter of the master and prototype or volume
submitter plan sponsor of such Company Plan, no such determination letter or
opinion or advisory letter has been revoked and revocation has not been
threatened, and no such Company Plan has been amended since the date of its most
recent determination letter, opinion or advisory letter, or application therefor
in any respect, and no act or omission has occurred, that would adversely affect
its qualification or increase its cost. There has been no termination or partial
termination of such a Company Plan. Each Company Plan that is required to
satisfy Section 401(k)(3) or Section 401(m)(2) of the Code has been tested for
compliance with, and satisfies the requirements of Section 401(k)(3) and Section
401(m)(2) of the Code for each plan year ending prior to the Closing Date.

            (e) Neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever maintained or contributed to an Employee Benefit Plan subject to Section
412 of the Code or Title IV of

                                      -29-

            (f) No Company Plan has assets that include securities issued by the
Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate.

            (g) With respect to the Company Plans, there are no benefit
obligations for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and
there are no benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by reserves,
or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP, on the Financial
Statements. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liability for
benefits (contingent or otherwise) under any Company Plan, except as set forth
on the Financial Statements. The assets of each Company Plan that is funded are
reported at their fair market value on the books and records of such Employee
Benefit Plan. There are no unfunded obligations under any Company Plan providing
benefits after termination of employment to any employee of the Company or any
Subsidiary (or to any beneficiary of any such employee), including but not
limited to retiree health coverage and deferred compensation, but excluding
continuation of health coverage required to be continued under Section 4980B of
the Code or other applicable law and insurance conversion privileges under state
law, but only to the extent that such continuation of coverage is provided
solely at the participant's or beneficiary's expense.

            (h) No act or omission has occurred and no condition exists with
respect to any Company Plan that would subject the Buyer, the Company, any
Subsidiary, any ERISA Affiliate, or any plan participant to (i) any fine,
penalty, Tax or liability of any kind imposed under ERISA or the Code or (ii)
any contractual indemnification or contribution obligation protecting any
fiduciary, insurer or service provider with respect to any Company Plan, nor
will the transactions contemplated by this Agreement give rise to any such
liability.

            (i) No Company Plan is funded by, associated with or related to a
"voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section
501(c)(9) of the Code.

            (j) Each Company Plan is amendable and terminable unilaterally by
the Company at any time without liability or expense other than administrative
and legal expenses related to such amendment or termination to the Company or
such Company Plan as a result thereof (other than for benefits accrued through
the date of termination or amendment and reasonable administrative expenses
related thereto) and no Company Plan, plan documentation or agreement, summary
plan description or other written communication distributed generally to
employees by its terms prohibits the Company from amending or terminating any
such Company Plan, or in any way limit such action.

            (k) Section 2.22(k) of the Disclosure Schedule discloses each: (i)
agreement with any stockholder, director, executive officer or other key

shall file all of its Tax Returns on the basis that the Merger qualifies as a
"reorganization" as defined in Section 368(a) of the Code. No party shall

actions) would reasonably be interpreted to likely cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization."

cause the Surviving Corporation to continue the Company's historic business or
will use a significant portion of the Company's historic business assets in a

be obligated to sell or dispose of or hold separately (through a trust or
otherwise) any assets or businesses of the Buyer or its Affiliates.

            (c) The Buyer and the Company shall be equally responsible for the

necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Disclosure Statement in

may, in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach by the
Company of Section 4.9 hereof, withdraw or modify the recommendation by the
Company's Board of Directors of this Agreement and the Merger (an "Adverse
Recommendation"), if the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and taking into account any changes to

Agreement either at a special meeting of stockholders or pursuant to a written
stockholder consent and is after the fifth business day following the Buyer's
receipt of written notice advising the Buyer that the Company's Board of
Directors desires to withdraw or modify the recommendation due to the existence
of a Superior Proposal (or any material change in the terms of such Superior
Proposal), specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal (including any such material changes), and identifying the person
making such Superior Proposal. Such five business day period shall be required
for each and every Superior Proposal or material modification thereto. Nothing
in this Section 4.4 shall be deemed to (A) permit the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "Alternative
Acquisition Agreement") constituting or relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.9 hereof
entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 4.9), (B) affect any
obligation of the Company under this Agreement or (C) limit the Company's

Board of Directors has withdrawn or modified its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger.

            (a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Buyer supplemental information concerning events or circumstances
occurring subsequent to the date hereof which would render any representation,
warranty or statement of the Company in this Agreement or the Disclosure
Schedule inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect at any time after the
date of this Agreement until the Closing. No such supplemental information shall
be deemed to avoid or cure any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or
constitute an amendment of any representation, warranty or statement in this
Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule.

            (b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer shall promptly deliver
to the Company supplemental information concerning events or circumstances

stockholder consent, the Company may, to the extent required by the fiduciary
obligations of the Company's Board of Directors, as determined in good faith by
the Company's Board of Directors after consultation with outside counsel, in
response to a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from an
unaffiliated third party made or received after the date of this Agreement that
the Company's Board of Directors determines in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel and a nationally recognized independent financial advisor
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, in each case that did not
result from a breach by the Company of this Section 4.9, and subject to
compliance with Section 4.9(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Advisors pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party
than the NDA and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of a revised Acquisition Proposal) with such person and its
Advisors regarding any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 4.9
by any Advisor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such
person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or otherwise, shall be
deemed to be a material breach of this Section 4.9 by the Company.

            (c) The Company shall promptly, and in any event within one business
day, notify any party with which discussions or negotiations of the nature
described in paragraph (a) above were pending that the Company is terminating
such discussions or negotiations. If the Company receives any Acquisition
Proposal or any request for information in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, or of any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall, within two
business days after such receipt, notify the Buyer of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, including the identity of the other party and the terms of
such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

      6.2   Indemnification Claims.

            (a) The Buyer shall give written notification to the Representative
of the commencement of any Third Party Action. Such notification shall be given
within 20 days after receipt by the Buyer of notice of such Third Party Action,
and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent then known by the Buyer)
the facts constituting the basis for such Third Party Action and the amount of
the claimed damages. No delay or failure on the part of the Buyer in so
notifying the Representative shall relieve the Equity Holders of any liability
or obligation hereunder except to the extent of any damage or liability caused
by or arising out of such delay or failure. Within 20 days after delivery of
such notification, the Representative may, upon written notice thereof to the
Buyer, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer; provided that (i) the Representative may
only assume control of such defense if (A) he, she or it acknowledges in writing
to the Buyer that any damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be
assessed against the Buyer in connection with such Third Party Action constitute
Damages for which the Buyer shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VI,
(B) the ad damnum does not exceed 110% of the amount of Damages for which the
Equity Holders are liable under this Article VI, and (C) an adverse resolution
of the Third Party Action would not have a material adverse effect on the
goodwill or reputation of the Buyer or the business, operations or future
conduct of the Buyer and (ii) the Representative may not assume control of the
defense of Third Party Action involving criminal liability or in which equitable
relief is sought against the Buyer and may not assume control of any Tax
Proceeding to the extent such Tax Proceeding involves consolidated or combined
Tax Returns of the Buyer for any Tax period (or portion thereof) after the
Closing Date or a potential Tax liability which may exceed 110% of the amount
for which the Equity Holders may be liable under this Article VI after taking
into account the amount of all other liabilities for which claims have been made
by the Buyer. If the Representative does not, or is not permitted under the
terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a Third Party Action, the
Buyer shall control such defense. The Non-controlling Party may participate in
such defense at its own expense. The Controlling Party shall keep the
Non-controlling Party advised of the status of such Third Party Action and the
defense thereof and shall consider in good faith recommendations made by the
Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party shall
furnish the Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect
to such Third Party Action (including copies of any summons, complaint or other
pleading which may have been served on such party and any written claim, demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall
otherwise cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such
Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of counsel to the Buyer with respect
to a Third Party Action shall be considered Damages for purposes of this
Agreement if (i) the Buyer controls the defense of such Third Party Action
pursuant to the terms of this Section 6.2(a) or (ii) the Representative assumes
control of such defense and the Buyer reasonably concludes that the
Representative and the Buyer have conflicting interests or different defenses
available with respect to such Third Party Action. The Representative shall not
agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third
Party Action without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided that the consent of the
Buyer shall not be required if the Representative agrees in writing to pay any
amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and such settlement or
judgment includes a complete release of the Buyer from further liability and has
no other adverse effect on the Buyer. Except as provided in Section 6.2(f)
below, the Buyer shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written
consent of the Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

            (b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VI, the
Buyer shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Representative.

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

            (c) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Representative shall deliver to the Buyer a Response, in which the
Representative, on behalf of the Equity Holders, shall: (i) agree that the Buyer
is entitled to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case the Response
shall be accompanied by a letter instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the
Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Shares a number of shares that if
multiplied by a value of $12.50 per share will equal the Claimed Amount), (ii)
agree that the Buyer is entitled to receive the Agreed Amount (in which case the
Response shall be accompanied by a letter instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse to the Buyer from the Indemnification Escrow Shares a number of shares
that if multiplied by a value of $12.50 per share will equal the Agreed Amount)
or (iii) dispute that the Buyer is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount. The Equity Holders may contest the payment of all or a portion of the
Claimed Amount only based upon a good faith belief that all or such portion of
the Claimed Amount does not constitute Damages for which the Buyer is entitled
to indemnification under this Article VI. If no Response is delivered by the
Equity Holders within such 30-day period, the Equity Holders shall be deemed to
have agreed that all of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Buyer. Acceptance by
the Buyer of partial payment of any Claimed Amount shall be without prejudice to
the Buyer's right to claim the balance of any such Claimed Amount.

            (d) During the 30-day period following the delivery of a Response
that reflects a Dispute, the Equity Holders and the Buyer shall use good faith
efforts to resolve the Dispute. If the Dispute is not resolved within such
30-day period, the Equity Holders and the Buyer shall submit the Dispute to
binding arbitration and such Dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
Section 6.2(e).

            (e) Any arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California,
in the case of a claim made by the Buyer, or in Boston, Massachusetts, in the
case of a claim made by the Representative, by a single arbitrator (the
"Arbitrator") in accordance with the Commercial Rules in effect from time to
time and the following provisions:

                  (i) In the event of any conflict between the Commercial Rules
in effect from time to time and the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
of this Agreement shall prevail and be controlling;

                  (ii) Either party shall commence the arbitration by filing a
written submission with the office of the AAA in the appropriate city and state
as provided by this Section 6.2(e) in accordance with Commercial Rule 5 (or any
successor provision);

                  (iii) All depositions or other discovery shall be conducted
pursuant to the applicable U.S. federal rules relating to discovery;

                  (iv) Not later than 30 days after the conclusion of the
arbitration hearing, the Arbitrator shall prepare and distribute to the parties
a writing setting forth the arbitral award and the Arbitrator's reasons
therefor. Any award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered and enforced in
any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to Section 12.11);

                  (v) The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority, under the
Commercial Rules or otherwise, to (x) modify or disregard any provision of this
Agreement, including the provisions of this Section 6.2(e), or (y) address or
resolve any issue not submitted by the parties; and

                  (vi) In connection with any arbitration proceeding pursuant to
this Agreement, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses, except that
the fees and costs of the AAA

                                      -50-
<PAGE>

and the Arbitrator, the costs and expenses of obtaining the facility where the
arbitration hearing is held, and such other costs and expenses as the Arbitrator
may determine to be directly related to the conduct of the arbitration and
appropriately borne jointly by the parties (which shall not include any party's
attorneys' fees or costs, witness fees (if any), costs of investigation and
similar expenses) shall be shared equally by the Buyer and the Equity Holders.

            (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 6.2, if a
third party asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that the Buyer is liable
to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may constitute or
result in Damages for which the Buyer may be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VI, and the Buyer reasonably determines that it has a
valid business reason to fulfill such obligation, then (i) the Buyer shall be
entitled to satisfy such obligation, without prior notice to or consent from the
Representative or the Equity Holders, (ii) the Buyer may subsequently make a
claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this Article VI,
and (iii) the Buyer shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the provisions of
this Article VI, for any such Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Article VI (subject to the right of the Equity
Holders to dispute the Buyer's entitlement to indemnification, or the amount for
which it is entitled to indemnification, under the terms of this Article VI).

            (g) The Representative shall have full power and authority on behalf
of each Equity Holder to take any and all actions on behalf of, execute any and
all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive any and all rights of, the
Equity Holders under this Article VI. The Representative shall have no liability
to any Equity Holder for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Equity
Holders pursuant to this Article VI.

      6.3   Survival of Representations and Warranties. Unless otherwise
specified in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement, all provisions of
this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue forever in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms; provided that the representations and
warranties of the Buyer set forth in Sections 3.6 and 3.7 and the covenants of
the Buyer set forth in Section 4.8(b) (as they relate to such representations
and warranties) shall terminate at, and shall not survive, the Closing. All
representations and warranties (other than those set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3,
2.9, 2.13 and 2.23) and all covenants and other agreements of the Company set
forth in Article IV (other than those set forth in Sections 4.2, 4.13 and 4.14)
shall expire on the date 18 months following the Closing Date, and the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.9, 2.13 and
2.23 and the covenants and other agreements of the Company set forth in Sections
4.2, 4.13 and 4.14 shall survive for a period of 30 months following the Closing
Date. If the Buyer delivers to the Representative, before expiration of a
representation or warranty, either a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such
representation or warranty, or an Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of
such representation or warranty, then the applicable representation or warranty
shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter
covered by such notice. If the legal proceeding or written claim with respect to
which a Claim Notice or an Expected Claim Notice has been given is definitively
withdrawn or resolved in favor of the Buyer, the Buyer shall promptly so notify
the Representative. The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VI
shall not be affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of the
Buyer or any actual or implied knowledge or notice acquired (or capable of being
acquired) by the Buyer, whether before or after the date of this Agreement or
the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject of
indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing
condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the
performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

      6.4   Limitations.

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

            (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Equity
Holders shall not be liable under Section 6.1(a) or clause (x) of Section 8.2
unless and until the aggregate Damages for which they would otherwise be liable
under Section 6.1(a) and clause (x) of Section 8.2 exceed $1,000,000 (at which
point the Equity Holders shall become liable for the aggregate Damages under
Sections 6.1(a) and clause (x) of Section 8.2 and not just amounts in excess of
$1,000,000); provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this paragraph
(a) shall not apply with respect to any liability with respect to breaches of
Section 2.9(o) or, for the avoidance of doubt, liability under clauses (y) or
(z) of Section 8.2.

respect to claims resulting from or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement (including any claim under Article VIII) or arising out of or in
connection with the Company's obligations under this Agreement shall be the
Indemnification Escrow Shares.

            (c) No Equity Holder shall have any right of contribution against
the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by the
Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
nothing in this Article VI or in Article VIII is intended to create an
affirmative indemnity obligation by any Equity Holder for fraud or knowing
misrepresentation (it being understood that the foregoing shall not limit any
right of the Buyer to assert any claim based on fraud or knowing
misrepresentation not based on the indemnification obligations set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 8.2 of this Agreement (as affirmed by Section 4 of the
Stockholders Agreement and Section 2 of the Management Participant Agreement)).

            (e) Any recovery of Damages by the Buyer for indemnification
pursuant to Article VI shall be offset by any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Buyer corresponding to such indemnification claim. To the extent
the Buyer receives any such insurance proceeds after the delivery of
Indemnification Escrow Shares from the Equity Holders pursuant to Section 3 of
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement, the Buyer will issue and deliver that
number of Buyer Common Shares equal to the value of the insurance proceeds to
the Equity Holders or to the Escrow Agent, to be allocated among the Equity
Holders in accordance with Article I of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII
                             REGISTRATION OF SHARES

      7.1   California Permit; Registered Offering.

            (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, the Buyer shall prepare the necessary documents and apply to obtain a
California Permit so that the issuance of the Buyer Common Shares in the Merger
shall be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, by virtue of the
exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) thereof; provided,
however, that the Buyer shall use all Reasonable Best Efforts to prepare and
file the application to obtain a California Permit within 15 days after the
later of (i) execution of this Agreement and (ii) the date on which the Company
has furnished to the Buyer materials in conformity with the requirements of such

Buyer in connection with the Buyer's application for the California Permit,
including such Disclosure Statement, financial statements and other information
with respect to the Company as, in the reasonable judgment of the Buyer or its
counsel, are required to be filed therewith. The Company and the Buyer will
respond promptly to any comments from the California Commissioner of
Corporations and will each use Reasonable Best Efforts to have the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

California Permit granted as soon as practicable after such filing; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall be understood to require either the Company
or the Buyer to amend its respective charter documents. None of the information
supplied by the Company to the Buyer, the California Commissioner of
Corporations or any representative thereof in connection with the California
Permit application or any other document prepared to comply with federal or
state securities laws shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. None of the information supplied by the Buyer to the Company,
the California Commissioner of Corporations or any representative thereof in
connection with the California Permit application or any other document prepared
to comply with federal or state securities laws shall contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall
promptly advise the Buyer, and the Buyer shall promptly advise the Company, in
writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the Company or the
Buyer, as applicable, shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it
necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the California Permit
application in order to make the statements contained or incorporated by
reference therein not misleading or to comply with applicable law.

            (b) If a California Permit cannot be issued for any reason, or is
not issued on or before the date that is 75 days after the date of the initial
filing of the application to obtain a California Permit, then the Parties shall
use their Reasonable Best Efforts to permit the delivery of Buyer Common Shares
pursuant to the Merger to be accomplished by means of registration of such Buyer
Common Shares on a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (or another appropriate
form) (the "Registration Statement") under the Securities Act. If the Buyer
Common Shares will be issued pursuant to an effective Registration Statement,
the Buyer shall prepare, with the assistance and cooperation of the Company, the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC as
promptly as is reasonably practicable. The Buyer shall file the Registration
Statement with the SEC and shall, with the assistance and cooperation of the
Company, promptly respond to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement and
shall otherwise use its Reasonable Best Efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and to
maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statement through the Effective
Time. The Buyer shall advise the Company promptly after it receives notice of
(i) the Registration Statement being declared effective or any supplement or
amendment thereto being filed with the SEC, (ii) the issuance of any stop order
in respect of the Registration Statement, and (iii) the receipt of any
substantive correspondence, comments or requests from the SEC in respect of the
Registration Statement. Following receipt of such notice from the Buyer, the
Company shall promptly distribute the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to the Company
Stockholders. The Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall include
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus the unanimous recommendation of its Board of
Directors that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger. Each of the Buyer and the Company
shall also cooperate to, and shall, take such other reasonable actions (other
than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not so
qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in
connection therewith. The Buyer will pay all customary expenses in connection
with the Registration Statement, including, without limitation, registration
fees, legal and accounting fees, listing fees, transfer agent fees and printing
and mailing costs related to the Registration Statement. None of the information
supplied by the Company to the Buyer for inclusion in the Registration Statement
shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. None
of the information supplied by the Buyer for inclusion in the Registration
Statement shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;
provided that, for the avoidance of

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

doubt, the Buyer shall not be responsible for the accuracy or completeness of
any information relating to the Company or furnished by the Company in writing
for inclusion in the Registration Statement.

            (c) Section 7.1(c) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
those persons who are, in the Company's reasonable judgment, Rule 145
Affiliates. The Company shall notify the Buyer in writing of any change in the
identity of its Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall
be entitled to place appropriate legends on the certificates evidencing any
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be received by Rule 145 Affiliates of the
Company in the Merger reflecting the restrictions set forth in Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act and to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for Buyer Common Stock (provided that such
legends or stop transfer instructions shall be removed one year after the
Effective Time, upon the request of any holder of shares of Buyer Common Stock
issued in the Merger, if such holder is not then a Rule 145 Affiliate of the
Buyer).

      7.2   Lock-up Agreements.

            (a) The Company shall deliver to the Buyer at the Closing the
written undertaking of each Management Participant, each other Company
Stockholder that is a member of the Company's management and each Company
Stockholder that as a result of the consummation of the Merger, and together
with its Affiliates, would be the holder of more than 240,000 Buyer Common
Shares (or in lieu of any single such Company Stockholder, other Company
Stockholders who, in the aggregate, would be the holders of the same number of
shares held by the Company Stockholders as to which the Company would otherwise
be obligated to deliver such undertaking under this Section 7.2(a)) not to sell
or otherwise transfer or dispose of Buyer Common Shares, except as follows: (i)
one-third of the Buyer Common Shares held by such Management Participant or
Company Stockholder may be sold or otherwise transferred or disposed of during
the 180-day period immediately following the Closing, (ii) an additional
one-third of the Buyer Common Shares held by such Management Participant or
Company Stockholder may be sold or otherwise transferred during the period
commencing 180 days following the Closing and ending on the first anniversary of
the Closing, and (iii) the final one-third of the Buyer Common Shares held by
such Management Participant or Company Stockholder may be sold or otherwise
transferred following the first anniversary of the Closing.

            (b) The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect
to the shares or other securities subject to the foregoing restriction until the
end of such one year period.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                   TAX MATTERS

      8.1   Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes.

            (a) The Company shall prepare and timely file all Tax Returns of the
Company required to be filed (taking into account extensions) prior to the
Closing Date.

            (b) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be
prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns not filed on or before the Closing
Date, including Tax Returns which were required to be filed before the Closing
but were not filed and all other Tax Returns with respect to the Company or in
respect of its business, assets or operations.

            (c) Any Tax Return to be prepared and filed by the Buyer for taxable
periods beginning before the Closing Date shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the last previous similar Tax Return, to the extent such
reporting is allowable without significant risk of the imposition of penalties
or additions to Tax as determined by the Buyer in consultation with its Tax
advisors; provided however, if

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

the Company did not file a previous similar return, the Buyer shall prepare the
return in the manner determined in it sole discretion, in consultation with its
Tax advisors, including, but not limited to making voluntary disclosures of Tax
Returns which were not filed for previous taxable periods.

      8.2   Tax Indemnification by the Equity Holders. The Equity Holders shall
indemnify via the Indemnification Escrow Shares, pursuant and subject to, and in
accordance with, Article VI, the Buyer, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Affiliates in respect of, and hold the Buyer, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation and such Affiliates harmless, against (x) any and all
Damages resulting from, relating to, or constituting a breach of any
representation contained in Section 2.9 hereof, (y) the failure to perform any
covenant or agreement set forth in Article IV relating to Taxes or in this
Article VIII, and (z) without duplication, any and all Taxes due and payable by
the Surviving Corporation or the Company for any taxable period that ends (or is
deemed pursuant to Section 8.3(b) to end) on or before the Closing Date in
excess of any accruals for current Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) on the Closing Balance Sheet. Amounts payable pursuant to this Section
8.2 shall be computed after taking into account all Tax consequences to the
Buyer (or the Surviving Corporation) of (i) the receipt of (or the right to
receive) the indemnification payment and (ii) the incurrence and payment of the
liability that gave rise to the right to receive the indemnification payment.
Thus, it is the intention of the Parties that the Buyer be held harmless with
respect to the liability that gave rise to the right to the indemnification
payment on a total after-Tax basis.

      8.3   Allocation of Certain Taxes.

            (a) If the Surviving Corporation or the Company is permitted, but
not required, under applicable foreign, state or local Tax laws to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, such day shall be treated as
the last day of a taxable period.

            (b) Any Taxes for a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
and ending after the Closing Date with respect to the Surviving Corporation
and/or the Company shall be apportioned for purposes of Sections 2.9 and 8.2
between the portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of
the period commencing on the day immediately following the Closing Date based on
the actual operations of the Surviving Corporation and/or the Company, as the
case may be, during such portions of the periods, and each such portion of such
period shall be deemed to be a taxable period (whether or not it is in fact a
taxable period). For purposes of computing the Taxes attributable to the two
portions of a taxable period pursuant to this Section 8.3(b), the amount of any
item that is taken into account only once for each taxable period (e.g., the
benefit of graduated Tax rates, exemption amounts, etc.) shall be allocated
between the two portions of the period in proportion to the number of days in
each portion.

      8.4   Termination of Tax-Sharing Agreements. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Company shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company
shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for amounts due in
respect of periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

      8.5   Scope of Article VIII. Any claim by any Party relating to a breach
by another Party of their obligations under this Article VIII shall be pursued
in accordance with the procedures for indemnification claims, and shall
otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions, set forth in Article VI,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, Sections 6.3 and 6.4. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other term or condition of Article VI (except Sections 6.3 and
6.4), to the extent there is any inconsistency between the terms of Article VI
and this Article VIII with respect to the allocation of responsibility between
the Equity Holders and the Buyer for Taxes, the provisions of this Article VIII
shall govern.

investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising

obligations to indemnify and hold harmless exist on the date of this Agreement
(the "Existing Indemnification Obligations").

            (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall procure a six
year "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability

terminate or modify the Tail Policy following the Effective Time.

Any Party may give any notice, request, demand, claim or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, expedited courier,
messenger service, telecopy, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no
such notice, request, demand, claim or other communication shall be deemed to

whom it is intended. Any Party may change the address to which notices,
requests, demands, claims, and other communications hereunder are to be
delivered by giving the other Parties notice in the manner herein set forth.

      12.8 Governing Law. This Agreement (including the validity and
applicability of the arbitration provisions of this Agreement, the conduct of
any arbitration of a Dispute, the enforcement of any arbitral award made
hereunder and any other questions of arbitration law or procedure arising
hereunder) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of
law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions
other than those of the State of Delaware.

      12.9 Amendments and Waivers. The Parties may mutually amend any provision
of this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing; provided, however, that any
amendment effected subsequent to the Requisite Stockholder Approval shall be
subject to any restrictions contained in the Delaware General Corporation Act.
No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be valid unless the same
shall be in writing and signed by all of the Parties. No waiver of any right or
remedy hereunder shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed
by the Party giving such waiver. No waiver by any Party with respect to any
default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder shall be
deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence.

      12.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to limit the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so
modified.

      12.11 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Party (a) submits to the
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the State of Delaware in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including
any action or proceeding for the enforcement of any arbitral award made in
connection with any arbitration of a Dispute hereunder), (b) agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in
any such court, (c) waives any claim of inconvenient forum or other challenge to
venue in such court, (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court, and (e) waives any
right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement; provided in each case that, solely
with respect to any arbitration of a Dispute, the Arbitrator shall resolve all
threshold issues relating to the validity and applicability of the arbitration
provisions of this Agreement, contract validity, applicability of statutes of
limitations and issue preclusion, and such threshold issues shall not be

                                      -73-
<PAGE>

heard or determined by such court. Each Party agrees to accept service of any
summons, complaint or other initial pleading made in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in Section 12.7, provided that nothing in this Section 12.11
shall affect the right of any Party to serve such summons, complaint or other
initial pleading in any other manner permitted by law.

      12.12 Construction.

            (a) The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Party.

            (b) Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or
law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise.

            (c) Any reference herein to "including" shall be interpreted as
"including without limitation".

            (d) Any reference to any Article, Section or paragraph shall be
deemed to refer to an Article, Section or paragraph of this Agreement, unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise.

            (e) Any calculation of any conversion ratio pursuant to this
Agreement, or of any number of Buyer Common Shares calculated pursuant to this
Agreement, shall be subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock
split, stock dividend, reverse stock split or similar event affecting the Buyer
Common Shares after the date hereof.
