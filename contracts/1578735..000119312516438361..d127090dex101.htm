with all Environmental Laws.

4.18 _Taxes_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.18(a), Seller or the applicable Acquired
Company has duly filed (or has caused to be duly filed) all Tax Returns
(including any consolidated, combined, unitary, or other similar Tax Return
that includes or is required to include the Acquired Companies) required to be
filed by or with respect to the Acquired Companies and all such Tax
Returns are true, correct, and complete, and all Taxes (whether or not shown
on any Tax Return) due in connection with such Tax Returns or otherwise due
with respect to the Acquired Companies, have been paid in full or provision
for their payment has been made in the Most Recent Financial Statements or
will be made in the Closing GAAP Audit, as appropriate, and included for
purposes of determining the Final Purchase Price. To the knowledge of Seller,
no claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction
where an Acquired Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.18(a), no Acquired Company is currently the beneficiary of any extension of
time within which to file any Tax Return. No Taxes will become payable by any
Acquired Company as a result of the execution, delivery, or performance of
this Agreement, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, other than Taxes related to the Section 338(h)(10) Election,
and Taxes arising from the commutation of the Munich Re Agreement.

 

(b) None of the properties or assets of the Acquired Companies is or at the
Closing Date will be encumbered by any Liens arising out of any unpaid Taxes
(except for Permitted Liens) and to Sellers knowledge, there are no grounds
for the assertion or assessment of any Liens (except for Permitted Liens)
against any of the properties or assets of any Acquired Company in respect
of any Taxes.

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.18(c) hereto, there is no Action or
proceeding or unresolved claim for assessment or collection, pending or, to
Sellers knowledge,

 



30  threatened by, or present dispute with, a Taxing Authority for assessment or
collection from any Acquired Company of any Taxes of any nature (or Seller
with respect to Tax matters relating to any Acquired Company). No
Governmental Authority has asserted in writing any deficiency, claim or issue
with respect to Taxes or any adjustment to Taxes against any Acquired Company
with respect to any taxable period which has not previously been paid and for
which the period of assessment or collection remains open. Since January 1,
2012, no issue relating to the Acquired Companies or involving any Tax for
which the Acquired Companies might be liable has been resolved in favor of any
Taxing Authority in any audit or examination that, by application of the same
principles, could reasonably be expected to result in a deficiency for any
material Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any other period.

 

(d) The Acquired Companies have complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of all Taxes that the
Acquired Companies have been required to collect or withhold and have paid
over to the appropriate Taxing Authorities all amounts required to be so
withheld and paid over for all periods under all applicable Laws.

 

(e) Seller is not a "foreign person" within the meaning of Code Section
1445(f)(3).

 

(f) No Acquired Company has received or applied for a Tax ruling or entered
into a closing agreement pursuant to Section 7121 of the Code (or any
predecessor provision or any similar provision of Law), in either case, that
is binding on the Acquired Companies with respect to any filing period for
which the statute of limitations period is still open. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.18(f) with respect to the group comprised of Seller, KW
Reinsurance Company Ltd, and the Acquired Companies, no Acquired Company (i)
has ever been a member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group for purposes of filing Tax Returns other than a group the common parent
of which is Seller, (ii) has ever been a party to or bound by, nor does it
have or has it ever had any obligation under, any Tax allocation, sharing, or
indemnity agreement or any other similar contract or arrangement or (iii) has
any liability for the Taxes of any other Person under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of Law, as a transferee or
successor, or otherwise.

 

(g) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.18(g), there are no outstanding
agreements, waivers or arrangements extending the statutory period of
limitation applicable to any claim for, or the period for the collection or
assessment of, Taxes due from or with respect to any Acquired Company for any
taxable period, and there are no outstanding requests or demands to extend or
waive any such period of limitation or collection or assessment, and no power
of attorney granted by or with respect to any Acquired Company relating to
Taxes is currently in force.

 

(h) Schedule 4.18(h) lists all income Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of any
Acquired Company for taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2013,
and indicates those Tax Returns that have been or are currently being audited
or subject to similar examination. Seller has delivered to Buyer correct and
complete copies of all income Tax Returns filed by or on behalf of
any Acquired Company for taxable periods ending on or after December 31,
2013, and all private letter rulings, notices of proposed deficiencies,
deficiency notices, closing agreements, settlement agreements, and pending
ruling requests relating to Taxes submitted, received or agreed to by or on
behalf of any Acquired Company on or after such date.

 



31 (i) Neither Acquired Company will be required to include any item of income
in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable
period, or portion thereof, after the Closing Date as a result of (i) any
adjustment under Section 481 of the Code (or any similar provision of
applicable state, local, or non-United States Law) by reason of any change in
accounting method or otherwise, (ii) any "closing agreement" with or any
ruling received from any Governmental Authority executed on or before the
Closing Date, (iii) any intercompany transaction or excess loss account
described in Treasury Regulations under Section 1502 of the Code (or any
similar provision of Law), (iv) the installment or open transaction method of
accounting, the completed contract method of accounting or the cash method of
accounting with respect to a transaction that occurred on or before the
Closing Date, (v) any prepaid amount received on or before the Closing Date or
(vi) any election under Section 108(i) of the Code. Immediately after the
Closing Date, no Acquired Company will have any deferred intercompany items
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-13, and at such time
there will not exist any excess loss account within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-19 with respect to the stock of any Acquired
Company. No Acquired Company has ever had a "permanent establishment" (as
defined in any applicable income Tax treaty) or other taxable presence in any
country other than the United States. No Acquired Company owns any interest in
(i) except as set forth on Schedule 4.18(i), any entity taxed as a partnership
under Subchapter K of the Code, (ii) a "controlled foreign corporation" as
defined in Section 957 of the Code, or (iii), except as set forth on Schedule
4.18(i), a "passive foreign investment company" as defined in Section 1297 of
the Code.

 

(j) To the Sellers knowledge, since January 1, 2014, no Acquired Company has
participated in or performed or been part of any action or transaction
classified as a "reportable transaction" under Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4 (or any predecessor provision).

 

(k) Tax basis, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, and unearned premium
reserves for the Company have been computed and maintained in the manner
required under Sections 807, 832, and 846 of the Code and any other applicable
Tax provision in all material respects. The Company does not maintain a
"special loss discount account" or make "special estimated tax payments"
within the meaning of Section 847 of the Code. The Company has never been a
life insurance company as defined in Section 816 of the Code, nor has it ever
assumed, exchanged, administered, reinsured, or offered any policies or
contracts that would constitute life insurance contracts as defined under
Section 7702 of the Code or an annuity subject to Section 72 of the Code. The
Company has never issued, assumed, reinsured, modified, exchanged, or sold
any policies, contracts, or other products to customers that are intended to
or have ever been intended to qualify as a "pension plan contract" within the
meaning of Section 818(a) of the Code or were otherwise intended to qualify
under Sections 401, 403, 408, 412 or 457 of the Code.

(l) No Acquired Company has distributed stock of another corporation, or has
had its stock distributed by another corporation, in a transaction that was
governed, or purported or intended to be governed, in whole or in part, by
Section 355 or 361 of the Code during the two

 



32  years prior to the date of this Agreement or in a distribution which could
otherwise reasonably be expected to constitute a part of a plan or a series of
related transactions (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) that
includes the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Acquired Company
is subject to any current limitation (excluding for this purpose any such
limitation arising as a result of the purchase and sale pursuant to this
Agreement) under Sections 382, 383, or 384 of the Code (or any corresponding
or similar provision of Law) on its ability to utilize its net operating
losses, built-in losses, credits, or other similar items.

 

(m) Each Acquired Company files pursuant to a federal consolidated income Tax
Return. Each Acquired Company is a member of a federal consolidated return
group of which Seller is the common parent (the "Seller Affiliated Group").
All material Tax Returns required to be filed (taking into account extensions
thereof) by the Seller Affiliated Group (or any similar consolidated,
combined, unitary, or other similar group for state local, or non-U.S. Tax
purposes) for each taxable period during which any Acquired Company was a
member of such group have been duly and timely filed. All material Taxes owed
by the Seller Affiliated Group (or any such consolidated, combined, unitary
or other similar group) for each such taxable period have been timely and
fully paid. None of the Shares being transferred pursuant to this Agreement
constitute a "loss share" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36 to which the provisions of such regulations could apply.

(n) For the purposes of this Section 4.18, Section 8.2(c) and Article IX, any
reference to any Acquired Company shall be deemed to include any Person that
merged with or was liquidated into an Acquired Company and any subsidiary of
any Acquired Company.

4.19 _Insurance Matters_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.19(a), all policies, binders, slips,
certificates, and other agreements of insurance that are issued by the
Company (the "Insurance Contracts") in effect as of the date of this Agreement
and any and all marketing materials, are on forms in compliance in all
material respects with applicable Law (including, the approval or non-
objection of such forms by applicable Insurance Departments to the extent
required by applicable Law) (the "Forms"). To the knowledge of Seller, each
agent or sub-agent authorized to sell or administer products on behalf of the
Company was duly licensed (for the type of activity and business written,
sold, produced, underwritten or managed), and was appointed by the Acquired
Companies in compliance with applicable Law. Each of the contracts between the
Acquired Companies and any agent who is selling, underwriting, or issuing
business for or on behalf of the Company is valid, binding and in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) Schedule 4.19(b)(i) lists all reinsurance and coinsurance treaties or
agreements, slips, binders, cover notes and similar arrangements, including
retrocessional agreements, to which the Company is a party or under which the
Company has any existing rights, obligations or liabilities and which applies
to a policy period commencing on or after January 1, 2009 (the "Reinsurance
Agreements"), the effective date of each Reinsurance Agreement, the
termination date of each Reinsurance Agreement which has a definite
termination date, the name of the reinsurer and the name of the broker or
other intermediary. Seller has provided Buyer with a true and correct copy of
each Reinsurance Agreement, together with all amendments, waivers or other
changes thereto. Each of the Reinsurance Agreements is 

 



33  in full force and effect, and neither the Company, nor, to the knowledge of
Seller, any other party to a Reinsurance Agreement is in breach or default in
any material respect as to any provision thereof and there does not exist
under any provision thereof, any event that, with the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both, would constitute such a breach or default. No
Reinsurance Agreement contains any provision providing that the other party
thereto may terminate such Reinsurance Agreement, or that such Reinsurance
Agreement will be automatically terminated, by reason of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. All Reinsurance Agreements to which the
Company is a party, either as a cedent or a reinsurer or retrocessionaire,
comply in all material respects with all risk transfer criteria under GAAP,
and there is no investigation, inquiry or proceeding currently pending before
or, to the Sellers knowledge, threatened, by any Governmental Authority, to
which the Company is subject, with respect to the risk transfer
characteristics or the reporting or disclosure thereof, of any such
reinsurance or retrocession. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.19(b)(ii), to
the knowledge of Seller, since January 1, 2014, (i) the Company has not
received any written notice from any applicable reinsurer that any amount of
reinsurance ceded by the Company will be uncollectible or otherwise defaulted
upon and (ii) the Company is entitled under its respective domiciliary
insurance Law to take full credit in its statutory statements for all amounts
recoverable by it pursuant to any Reinsurance Agreement. 

(c) Prior to the date of this Agreement, Seller has delivered or made
available to Buyer a true and complete copy of any material actuarial reports
prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise, with respect to the Company
since January 1, 2014, and all attachments, addenda, supplements and
modifications thereto (the "Actuarial Analyses"). The information and data
furnished by the Company to its actuaries in connection with the preparation
of the Actuarial Analyses were accurate in all material respects. Furthermore,
each Actuarial Analysis was based, in all material respects, upon an accurate
inventory of policies in force for the Company, as the case may be, at the
relevant time of preparation and conforms to the requirements of applicable
Law.

 

(d) The aggregate reserves for claims, losses (including, without limitation,
incurred but not reported losses), loss adjustment expenses (whether
allocated or unallocated), unearned premium and uncollectable reinsurance, as
reflected in the annual Statutory Financial Statements referred to in Section
4.4(a)(i), (i) were determined in accordance with presently
accepted actuarial standards consistently applied (except as otherwise noted
in the Statutory Financial Statements and notes thereto included in such
Statutory Financial Statements); (ii) are fairly stated in accordance with
sound actuarial principles; (iii) were computed on the basis of methodologies
consistent in all material respects with those used in computing the
corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as otherwise noted in
the Statutory Financial Statements and notes thereto included in such
Statutory Financial Statements) and (iv) include provisions for all actuarial
reserves and related items which ought to be established in accordance with
the statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the California
Department and applicable Laws.

(e) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.19(e), the Acquired Companies have
filed (i) all reports, statements, documents, registrations, filings or
submissions (including without limitation any sales material) required to be
filed with any Insurance Department in the manner prescribed by applicable
insurance Laws and (ii) all material reports, statements, documents,
registrations, filings or submissions (including without limitation any sales
material)

 



34  with any other Governmental Authority in the manner prescribed by applicable
Laws. All such reports, registrations, filings and submissions were in
compliance in all material respects with applicable Law when filed or as
amended or supplemented, and no deficiencies have been asserted in writing by
any such Governmental Authority with respect to such reports, registrations,
filings or submissions that have not been remedied.

 

(f) Schedule 4.19(f) lists each agent through which the Acquired Companies
market, place or sell insurance who has generated premium on Business
policies since January 1, 2013 in excess of $500,000 per calendar year. Except
as set forth in Schedule 4.19(f), since January 1, 2013, none of the agents
listed in Schedule 4.19(f) has (i) terminated its relationship with the
Acquired Companies, (ii) materially decreased the placement, marketing or
sales of products issued by the Company or (iii) indicated in writing to the
Acquired Companies or Seller that such agent will terminate its relationship
with the Acquired Companies or materially decrease the placement, marketing or
sales of products issued by the Company. To the knowledge of Seller, each
insurance agent, at the time such agent wrote, sold or produced any
insurance policy for the Acquired Companies, (A) was duly licensed as an
insurance agent for the type of business written, sold or produced in the
particular jurisdiction in which such agent wrote, sold or produced such
business for the Acquired Companies and (B) was duly appointed as an agent or
sub-agent by the Acquired Companies.

4.20 _Related Parties_. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.20, none of Seller
and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and members and the

that are used in the Business.

 

4.21 _Consumer Privacy Laws_. Since January 1, 2013, each Acquired Company has
been in material compliance with any applicable privacy policies it has
established pertaining to Personal Information. There are no claims,
investigations or proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened by any Governmental Authority or claims or proceedings pending or,
to the knowledge of Seller, threatened by any Person other than a Governmental
Authority that Personal Information collected or stored by any Acquired
Company has been compromised, lost, taken without authorization, accessed
without authorization or misused in violation of Privacy Laws, any applicable
privacy policy of any Acquired Company, or any contractual provision between
any Acquired Company and any third party. Since January 1, 2013, no Acquired
Company (a) has received any written notice regarding any violation of any
Privacy Law from any Governmental Authority, and (b) to the Knowledge of
Seller, has had any data breach that has compromised any Personal Information.
None of the Acquired Companies maintain any websites that are accessible to
the general public that collect or store Personal Information. "Personal
Information" means any information (i) that can be used to distinguish or
trace an individuals identity, (ii) which is linked or linkable to a
specific identified or identifiable natural person and, with respect to health
or medical information, which does not meet the definition of de-identified as
defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,

and (iv) which the Acquired Companies are required to keep confidential under
applicable Law, or under any applicable privacy policy of any Acquired

third party. "Privacy Laws" shall

 



35  mean any applicable laws, statutes, rules, regulations, codes, orders,
decrees, and rulings thereunder of any federal, state, regional, county, city,
municipal or local government of the United States that apply to Personal

prohibited immediately following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (other than pursuant to applicable Law),
from using all Personal Information presently used in the Business. Except as

Company, on the one hand, and any third party on the other hand, relating to
Personal Information or the use or access of any database system housing such
Personal Information.

Buyer. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.22(ii), with respect to each such
insurance policy: (a) the policy is legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in
full force and effect; and (b) the policy will not continue to cover the
Acquired Companies after the Closing. The Acquired Companies are not in breach
or default (including with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of
notices) in any material respect, and no event has occurred which, with
notice or the lapse of time, would constitute a breach or default in any
material respect, or permit termination, modification, or acceleration under
the policy. To the knowledge of Seller, no other party is in breach or default
(including with respect to the payment of premiums or the giving of notices)
in any material respect, and no event has occurred which, with notice or the
lapse of time, would constitute, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not constitute, a breach or default in any material
respect, or permit termination, modification, or acceleration, under the
policy; and no other party to the policy has repudiated any provision thereof.
There is no material claim pending under any of such policies as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by or on behalf of the
underwriters of such policies or any other Person. Except as set forth in

of money or property or services, whether or not in contravention of Law, (a)
as a kickback or bribe to any Person or (b) to any political organization, or
the holder of or any aspirant to any elective or appointive public office
except for personal political contributions not involving the direct or
indirect use of funds of the Acquired Companies.

a contract or agreement with the Acquired Companies (including any beneficiary
of any account) is listed on any list of blocked Persons maintained by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury ("OFAC").

required to waive any condition precedent to comply with this Section 5.2.

 

5.3 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement_.

 

(a) Seller hereby acknowledges that it is familiar with the Acquired
Companies trade secrets and with other confidential information. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the Acquired Companies would be irreparably
damaged if Seller or any of its Affiliates were to compete with, or provide
services to or otherwise participate in the business of any Person competing
in, the Business and that any such competition, provision of services or
participation by Seller or its Affiliates would result in a significant loss
of goodwill by the Acquired Companies. Seller further acknowledges and agrees
that the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 5.3 were a
material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder, and that Buyer and its stockholders would not obtain
the benefit of the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically
negotiated by the parties hereto if Seller or any of its Affiliates breached
this Section 5.3. Therefore, Seller agrees, in further consideration of the
amounts to be paid hereunder for the Shares and the goodwill of the
Acquired Companies, to the covenants and obligations set forth in this
Section 5.3.

 



40 (b) Subject to subsection (e) of this Section 5.3, for the period from the
Closing until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing, Seller shall not
(and shall cause its Affiliates not to) directly or indirectly own any
interest in, manage, control, participate in (whether as an officer, director,
employee, partner, agent, representative or otherwise), consult with, render
services for, or in any other manner engage anywhere in the Restricted
Territory (as defined below) in any business engaged in competition with the
Business; provided, that nothing herein shall prohibit Seller or any of its
Affiliates from being a passive owner of not more than 2% of the outstanding
stock of any class of a corporation which is publicly traded so long as none
of such Persons has any active participation in the business of such
corporation; provided that the surplus lines business and reinsurance business
of K-W Reinsurance Company, Ltd. shall not deemed to be in competition with
the Business. Seller acknowledges that the Acquired Companies business has
been conducted or is presently proposed to be conducted throughout the United
States (the "Restricted Territory") and that the geographic restrictions set
forth above are reasonable and necessary to protect the goodwill of the
Companies Business being sold by Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

(c) Subject to subsection (e) of this Section 5.3, Seller agrees that for the
period from the Closing until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing it
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) directly or indirectly (i)
induce or attempt to induce any Transferred Employee to leave the employ
of the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates, or in any way interfere with
the relationship between the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates and any
Transferred Employee, (ii) hire any person who was an employee of Acquired
Companies at any time during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior
to the date on which such hiring would take place; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller shall not be restricted from hiring any employee of the Acquired
Companies or their Affiliates who responds to a general solicitation for
employment not targeted specifically to such employee, without any indirect or
indirect solicitation by Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

(d) Each party hereto agrees that it shall not (and it shall cause its
Affiliates not to), except done in good faith in any Action against the other
parties, (i) make any negative statement or communication regarding the other
parties, the Acquired Companies or any of their employees with the intent to
harm the other parties or the Acquired Companies or (ii) make any
derogatory or disparaging statement or communication regarding the other
parties, the Acquired Companies or any of their employees. Nothing in this
Section 5.3(d) shall limit a partys ability to make true and accurate
statements or communications in connection with any disclosure such party
reasonably believes is required pursuant to applicable Law.

(e) If any provision contained in this Section 5.3 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this
Section 5.3, but this Section 5.3 shall be construed as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the
intention of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants
contained herein is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of
time which is not permitted by applicable Laws, or in any way construed to be
null, void and of no effect, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe
and interpret or reform this Section 5.3 to provide for a covenant having
the maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions
(not greater than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable
under such applicable Law. Seller acknowledges that

 



41  Buyer and the Acquired Companies, would be irreparably harmed by any breach
by Seller of its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.3 and that there would
be no adequate remedy at law or in damages to compensate Buyer and the
Acquired Companies for any such breach and that, in addition to any relief at
law which may be available to such other party for such violation or breach or

Companies shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief as the
court may grant after considering the intent of this Section 5.3.

 

5.4 _Further Assurances_. Seller and Buyer agree that, from time to time for a

contemplated hereby.

5.5 _Conduct of Business_. From the date hereof through the Closing, Seller
shall have an unlimited right to manage all investment assets in accordance
with applicable Law; Seller may make such adjustments to employment practices
as necessary or appropriate to accommodate the transfer of employees from

otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, from the date hereof through the
Closing, Seller covenants and agrees that Seller shall cause the Acquired
Companies to operate the Business in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practices using commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain and preserve the Business (including the all insurance licenses), to
preserve the goodwill of customers, agents, brokers, reinsurers and all other
Persons having business relationships with the Acquired Companies, and to not

at its own expense to assist in the handling of such matter or claim;

 

(b) the Indemnifying Party shall consult with the Indemnified Party prior to
acting on major matters, shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such Third-Party
Claim or ceasing to defend against such matter or claim (with such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld), and shall provide the Indemnified Party with
all documents and information reasonably requested by the Indemnified Party;

(c) no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a full and
complete release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim; and

 

(d) the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement of any Third-Party Claim to the extent that the Third-Party Claim
(i) seeks an order, injunction, non-monetary or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party, (ii) could materially interfere with the business,
operations, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the
Indemnified Party, (iii) presents a reasonable possibility of a conflict of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party or (iv)
arises in connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action,

After written notice by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume control of the defense of any such Third-Party Claim and
proof of its financial responsibility pursuant to this Article VIII, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party hereunder for
any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable out-of-pocket
costs of investigation and of liaison counsel for the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for such
legal expenses if the Indemnified Party determines in good faith that the
incurrence of the same is appropriate in light of defenses not available to
the

 



50  Indemnifying Party, circumstances set forth in subsection (d) of this
Section 8.4 or other similar circumstances. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim as provided in this
Section 8.4, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend such Third-
Party Claim in such manner as it may deem appropriate with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party will promptly reimburse the
Indemnified Party therefor. The reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses with
respect to such Third-Party Claims shall be made by periodic payments during

determination that any inaccuracy or breach of a representation and
warranty hereunder has actually occurred.

8.5 _Survival Period_. The representations and warranties of Buyer and Seller
contained in this Agreement and Ancillary Documents shall survive the Closing
until the date which is one year and three months following the Closing Date
_provided_ , _however_ , the Seller Fundamental Representations and the Buyer
Fundamental Representations shall survive indefinitely and the Tax
Representations shall survive until sixty (60) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations; provided further, however, that the
representations in Section 4.19(d) shall not survive the Closing. Covenants
and agreements of Seller that contemplate or may involve actions to be taken
or obligations in effect after the Closing shall survive the Closing in
accordance with their terms. The "Survival Expiration Date" shall mean the
date upon which the applicable representation, warranty or covenant ceases to
survive.

 

8.6 _Offset; Adjustment to Final Purchase Price; Losses_.

 

(a) Any amounts agreed by Seller or finally adjudicated to be owing Buyer
pursuant to Section 8.2 may be offset by Buyer against any amounts payable to

by Seller, Buyer and their Affiliates as an adjustment to the Final Purchase
Price, and Seller, Buyer and their Affiliates shall not take any position
inconsistent therewith for any purpose.

 

8.7 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the rights of the Indemnified
Parties under this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of any
Indemnified Party against any Indemnifying Party with respect to any Losses
resulting from, or relating to, any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any other matter related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except (i) with respect to claims brought on the basis of fraud or criminal
activity, (ii) claims seeking specific performance or other equitable relief,
or (iii) as set forth in Article IX.

8.8 _Stockholder Release_.

 

Seller hereby agrees that it shall not make any claim for indemnification
against Buyer, any Acquired Company or any of their respective Affiliates by
reason of the fact that Seller is or was a stockholder or agent of any
Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates or is or was serving at the request
of any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates as a partner, trustee or
agent of 

 



51  another entity (whether such claim is for judgments, damages, penalties,
fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses, expenses or otherwise and
whether such claim is pursuant to any statute, charter document, by-law,
agreement or otherwise) with respect to any action, suit, proceeding,
complaint, claim or demand brought by any of the Buyer Parties against Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or applicable Law or otherwise, and Seller hereby
acknowledges and agrees that it shall not have any claim or right to
contribution or indemnity from any Acquired Company or any of its Affiliates
with respect to any amounts paid by it pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise. Effective upon the Closing, Seller hereby irrevocably waives,
releases and discharges the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates from any
and all Liabilities to it of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether in the
capacity as a stockholder of the Companies or their Affiliates or otherwise
(including in respect of any rights of contribution or indemnification), in
each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, known or
unknown, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding (other than
this Agreement and any of the other agreements executed and delivered in
connection herewith) or otherwise at law or in equity, and Seller agrees that
it shall not seek to recover any amounts in connection therewith
or thereunder from Acquired Companies or their Affiliates. In no event may
Seller seek contribution from the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates in
respect of any payments required to be made by Seller pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE IX

TAX MATTERS 

9.1 _Tax Returns and Payments_.

 

(a) Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, on a timely basis, all consolidated, unitary, combined, or similar Tax
Returns that include any Acquired Company and Seller or any Affiliate of
Seller (other than the Acquired Companies) (the "Consolidated Tax Returns")
for any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined in accordance
with Section 9.2) ending on or before the Closing Date and shall pay all
Taxes reflected on such Consolidated Tax Returns. The Acquired Companies shall
furnish Tax information to Seller and the appropriate Affiliates of Seller and
shall cooperate with Seller and the appropriate Affiliates of Seller as
reasonably necessary to prepare and file the Consolidated Tax Returns in
accordance with Sellers and the Acquired Companies past custom and practice.
Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date including any extension
thereof for filing any such Consolidated Tax Return, Seller shall provide
Buyer with a copy of such Consolidated Tax Return for Buyers review and
comment (which copies shall be in the form of pro-forma Tax Returns for each
relevant Acquired Company).

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
on a timely basis all Tax Returns with respect to the Acquired Companies for
any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined in accordance with Section
9.2) ending on or before the Closing Date that are due after the such
date, other than the Consolidated Tax Returns, and, subject to any potential
indemnity for Taxes as provided in Article VIII, pay all Taxes reflected on
such Tax Returns. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Law,
all such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Acquired Companies.

 



52 (c) Buyer shall provide Seller with a copy of each Tax Return required to be
prepared (or caused to be prepared) by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.1(b)
hereof at least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date (including any
extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, Seller shall have the
right to review and comment on such Tax Returns prior to the filing of such
Tax Return, and Seller shall provide Buyer written notice of any objections it
has with respect to such Tax Returns (a "Tax Dispute") within ten (10)
Business Days of the delivery of such Tax Return (and to the extent no such
notice is delivered within such ten (10) Business Day period, Seller shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to such Tax Returns as provided by Buyer).
In the event of any such timely objections, the parties shall in good faith
attempt to resolve such dispute for a period of five (5) Business Days
following the date on which Buyer was notified of the Tax Dispute; provided,
that if such dispute is not settled within such time period, the parties
shall promptly submit all such remaining disputed matters to the Neutral
Auditors for resolution in a timely manner so that such Tax Return may be
timely filed. If the Neutral Auditors are unable to make a determination with
respect to any disputed issue within five (5) Business Days before the due
date (including extensions) for the filing of the Tax Return in question, then
Buyer may file such Tax Return on the due date (including extensions) therefor
without such determination having been made and without the consent of
Seller; provided, however, that such Tax Return shall incorporate such changes
as have at the time of such filing been agreed to by the parties pursuant to
this Section 9.1(c). Notwithstanding the filing of such Tax Return, the
Neutral Auditors shall make a determination with respect to any disputed
issue, and the amount of Taxes, if any, with respect to which Seller or Buyer
may be responsible pursuant to this Articles VIII and IX shall be calculated
consistently with such determination. The decision by the Neutral Auditors
shall be final and binding on the parties with respect to how any such Tax
Return should be filed. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the fees and expenses relating to the Neutral Auditors pursuant to
this Section 9.1(c) shall be borne in inverse proportion to the degree that
each party prevails on the Tax Dispute, which proportionate allocation will
also be determined by the Neutral Auditors.

9.2 _Straddle Period Taxes_.

 

In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a taxable period that
begins before the Closing Date and ends after such date, the portion of any
such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending on the Closing
Date shall be:

(a) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) based upon or related to income
or receipts (other than premiums), or (B) imposed in connection with any sale
or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable
period ended on the Closing Date (based upon an interim closing of the books
as of such date); and

 

(b) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the
assets of the Acquired Companies, or otherwise measured by the level of any
item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator
of which is the number of calendar days in the period ending on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
period; and

 



53 (c) in the case of Taxes imposed on the basis of gross premiums, deemed equal
to the amount of Taxes that would be payable based upon the amount of premium
written as of the Closing Date.

9.3 _Intentionally Omitted_. 

9.4 _Sales and Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes, if any, imposed with
regard to the sale of Shares contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne
one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. Seller and Buyer will cooperate with
each other to file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes.

 

9.5 _Tax Refunds; Amended Tax Returns; Statute Extensions_.

 

Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto) relating to the
Acquired Companies for Taxes paid for any taxable period (or portion thereof,
calculated in accordance with Section 9.2) ending on or prior to the Closing
Date and not reflected or otherwise taken into account as an asset in the
calculation of the Adjusted Tangible Book Value pursuant to Section 2.3 shall
be the property of Seller, and if received by (or credited against any Tax of)
Buyer or the Acquired Companies shall be paid over promptly to the Seller;
provided, however, that any such Tax refund that is attributable to a
carryback of an Acquired Companys loss or credit from a taxable period (or
portion thereof, determined in accordance with Section 9.2) beginning after
the Closing Date shall be the property of Buyer. Buyer shall not cause or
permit any Acquired Company or any Affiliate of any Acquired Company to amend
or modify any Tax Return of any Acquired Company relating to any taxable
period (or portion thereof, determined in accordance with Section 9.2) ending
on or before the Closing Date, whether as a result of a carryback of any Tax
item to such taxable period or otherwise, without the written consent of
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall not
cause or permit any Acquired Company or any Affiliate of any Acquired Company
to waive any statute of limitations in respect of Taxes or agree to the
extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or deficiency of any
Acquired Company for any taxable period (or portion thereof, determined in
accordance with Section 9.2) ending on or before the Closing Date, without
the written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

 

9.6 _Tax Contest_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing of the
commencement of any Tax Contest. Such notice shall contain
factual information (to the extent known to Buyer or the Acquired Companies)
describing the asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include
copies of any notice or other document received from any Governmental
Authority in respect of any such asserted Tax liability; provided, however,
that any delay or failure to give such prompt notification shall not affect
Sellers obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to Article VIII with
respect to such Tax Contest except and only to the extent that Seller are
adversely impacted as a result of such failure.

(b) In the case of any Tax Contest that relates to (i) a taxable period
ending on or before, or that includes, the Closing Date, or (ii) any matter
which could increase Sellers liability for Taxes (including Taxes which
Seller Parties are required to pay pursuant to Section 

 



54  8.2(c) of this Agreement), Seller shall have the right, upon written notice
to Buyer, to participate in or, with respect to any taxable period (or portion
thereof (determined in accordance with Section 9.2), ending on or before the
Closing Date assume the defense of and control the conduct of such Tax Contest
or, in the case of a portion of a taxable period, the portion of such Tax
Contest that relates to such portion (but only to the extent that the
relevant governmental or judicial party conducting such Tax Contest permits
such portion of such Tax Contest to be controlled by Seller at the same time
as the portion of such Tax Contest that relates to the remainder of such
taxable period is controlled by Buyer). If Seller does not assume the defense
of any such Tax Contest or portion thereof, Buyer may defend the same in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, including settling such Tax Contest or
portion of such Tax Contest (subject, however, to Section 9.6(c) if such
settlement would adversely affect Seller) after giving ten (10) days prior
written notice to Seller setting forth the terms and conditions of settlement.

 

(c) Neither Buyer and its Affiliates nor Seller and its Affiliates shall enter
into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax Contest
which would adversely affect the other party for such year or a subsequent or
prior year without first obtaining the written consent of the other party,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller and its Affiliates shall exclusively control the conduct of any notice
of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other
administrative or judicial proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim involving
any Consolidated Tax Return, and Seller and its Affiliates shall have
sole discretion in administering any such claims including the right to
settle such claims.

(e) For purposes of clarity, where the provisions of this Section 9.6 and
Section 8.4 conflict, the provisions of this Section 9.6 shall control.

9.7 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Buyer, and their
respective Affiliates, shall provide each other with such cooperation and
information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing
any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a
liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or
conducting any Tax Contest or any audit or similar examination of any Acquired
Company in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include,
but not be limited to, providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and
documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Governmental
Authorities. Each party and its Affiliates shall make its employees available
on a basis mutually convenient to both parties to provide explanations of any
documents or information provided hereunder. Seller and Buyer shall each
retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other
documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Acquired Companies
for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior
taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified
in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii)
three (3) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax
Returns. Neither Seller, on the one hand, nor Buyer or the Acquired Companies,
on the other hand, shall dispose of any

 



55  such materials unless it first offers in writing to the other party the
right to take possession of such materials at such other partys sole expense
and the other party fails to accept such offer within fifteen (15) Business
Days of the offer being made. Any information obtained under this Section 9.7
shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in connection
with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting a Tax
Contest or as otherwise may be required by applicable law, regulation or the
rules of any stock exchange.

 

9.8 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. As of the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause the participation of each Acquired Company in all written Tax
allocation and Tax sharing agreements and arrangements between Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies), on the one hand, and such
Acquired Company, on the other hand, to be terminated as of the Closing
Date so that such Acquired Company will have no further rights or obligations
thereunder.

9.9 _Unified Loss Rules; Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

(a) To the extent Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 is applicable to
Seller or any other member of a federal income tax consolidated group that
includes Seller or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the sale of any of
the Shares pursuant to this Agreement, Seller shall make or shall cause the
common parent of any such group to make the election provided under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-36 (including, without limitation, on a protective
basis) to reduce the Tax basis that Seller has in such Shares so as to prevent
any reduction of any Tax attributes of the Acquired Companies, and Seller (or
any other Person) shall not make any election otherwise permitted under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36 with respect to the sale of the Shares
pursuant to this Agreement that would result in the reattribution of the Tax
attributes of the Acquired Companies to Seller or any other member of a
federal income tax consolidated group that includes Seller or any Affiliate
thereof. Seller agrees to furnish to Buyer a copy of any elections
described in this paragraph at least ten (10) days prior to filing such
election with the IRS.

(b) The Acquired Companies and Seller will join with Buyer in making a timely
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding election
under state, local or foreign tax law) with respect to the purchase and sale
of its Shares hereunder (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election").

(c) Seller and Buyer agree that, the aggregate deemed sales price ("ADSP")
(within the meaning of Treasury Regulations §1.338-4) and the amount of the
adjusted grossed-up basis ("AGUB") (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
§1.338-5) for Buyers purchase of the applicable Shares shall be allocated
among the assets of the Acquired Company in a manner consistent with Code
§§338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder (the "Asset Allocation"). Buyer
shall, not later than forty-five (45) days before the proposed date for filing
the Section 338(h)(10) Election, provide to Seller, for its review and
comment a calculation of the Asset Allocation to be used in preparing the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Within ten (10) days after the delivery of such
Asset Allocation, Seller will propose to Buyer in writing any reasonable
changes to the Asset Allocation (and in the event no such changes are so
proposed to the Buyer within such time period, Seller will be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the Asset Allocation in the form provided.) Seller and
Buyer will attempt in good faith to resolve

 



56  any timely-raised issues arising as a result of Sellers review of such
Asset Allocation within ten (10) days after Buyers receipt of a timely
written notice of objection from Seller, in order to permit the timely filing
of the Section 338(h)(10) Election. If Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on
the Asset Allocation within such time period, Seller and the Buyer shall
jointly request the Neutral Auditor to resolve any issue in dispute at least
fifteen (15) days before the proposed date for filing the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, in order that such election may be timely filed, with the fees and
expenses of the Neutral Auditors to be split equally by Buyer and Seller.
Buyer shall prepare IRS Form 8023 (and any required attachments thereto) and
any similar state, local or foreign tax forms (and any required attachments)
required to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election (collectively, "Election
Forms" and each singularly, the "Election Form") consistently with the Asset
Allocation as finally determined, and shall submit the Election Forms to
Seller not later than five (5) days prior to the proposed filing date of the
Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall promptly execute the applicable
Election Forms and shall return such Election Forms to Buyer promptly and in
any event not more than two (2) days after the date on which the
Election Forms are submitted to Seller. Each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies
and Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8883) in a manner
consistent with the Asset Allocation and the Section 338(h)(10) Election as so
finalized, and shall not take any position inconsistent with the Section
338(h)(10) Election or the Asset Allocation as so finalized, unless otherwise
required by a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code
or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. law). In the event that
any adjustment is required to be made to the Asset Allocation as a result of
the payment of any additional purchase price for the Shares or otherwise,
Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared in a reasonable manner, and shall
provide to Acquired Companies a revised Asset Allocation reflecting such
adjustment. Such revised Asset Allocation shall be subject to review and
resolution of timely raised dispute in the same manner as the initial Asset
Allocation. To the extent required, each of Buyer, the Acquired Companies and
Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including a revised IRS Form 8883) in a
manner consistent with the Asset Allocation as so revised, and shall not
(except pursuant to any further revision to the Asset Allocation in
accordance with this Section 9.9(c)) take any position inconsistent with the
Section 338(h)(10) Election or the Asset Allocation as so revised, unless
otherwise required by a determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. law).

extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other,
waive any inaccuracies in the representations or warranties or compliance with
any of the covenants or performance of any of the obligations of the other
contained in this Agreement, or waive fulfillment of any of the conditions to
its own obligations under this Agreement. Neither any failure nor any delay by
any

 



61  party in exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement will
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any
other or further exercise of such right, power or privilege or the exercise of
any other right, power or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be
discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of
the claim or right unless in writing signed by each other party; (b) no waiver
that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the
specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on
one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of
the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action
without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement.

11.15 _Severability_. In the event that a court or arbitral body of competent
jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, such decision shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of any of the other provisions of this Agreement, which other provisions shall
remain in full force and effect, and the application of such invalid, illegal
or unenforceable provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to
which it is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable shall be valid and be
enforced to the fullest extent permitted by Law. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, each party waives any provision of Law that renders any
provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect.

Holder interest on the unpaid principal amount hereof from time to time
outstanding at a rate per annum equal to four and 4/10 percent (4.4%) per

the actual number of days elapsed. 4\. _Payments_. Any payment hereunder which is stated to be due on a day which
is not a Business Day shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day (and
interest shall accrue for such extension of time). All amounts payable
hereunder shall be paid in U.S. Dollars no later than 12:00 PM New York City
time on the date on which such payment is due by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. Except as set forth in Section 2 hereof, all payments made
hereunder shall be applied first, to accrued and unpaid interest and second,

5\. _Default_. The occurrence of any one or more of the following events shall
constitute an event of default (each an "Event of Default") hereunder:

of principal and/or interest hereunder within fifteen (15) Business Days after
such payment is due; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | if the Company becomes insolvent or makes an assignment for
the benefit of creditors; or 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | if there shall be filed by or against the Company any
petition for any relief under the bankruptcy laws of the United States now or
hereafter in effect or any proceeding shall be commenced with respect to the
Company under any insolvency, readjustment of debt, reorganization,
dissolution, liquidation or similar law or statute of any jurisdiction now or
hereafter in effect (whether at law or in equity), provided that in the case
of any involuntary filing or the commencement of any involuntary proceeding
against the Company such proceeding or petition shall have continued
undismissed and unvacated for ninety (90) days; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (d) | if any petition or application to any court or tribunal, at
law or in equity, shall be filed by or against the Company for the appointment
of any receiver for the Company or any material part of the property of
the Company; provided that in the case of any involuntary filing against the
Company, such proceeding or appointment shall have continued undismissed and

6\. _Remedies Upon Default_. If any Event of Default shall occur for any
reason, then and in any such event, in addition to all rights and remedies of
the Holder under applicable Law or otherwise, all such rights and remedies
being cumulative, not exclusive and enforceable alternatively, successively

owing under this Note to be due and payable, whereupon the then unpaid
principal balance hereof, together with all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, shall forthwith become due and payable. All unpaid principal and
interest on this Note shall bear interest at a rate equal to eight percent
(8%) per annum thereafter to the extent such amount due and payable is
overdue. Company shall indemnify Holder for all costs of collection incurred
by Holder after an Event of Default, including, without limitation reasonable
attorneys fees.

 



2 7\. _Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Note_. If this Note shall be
mutilated, lost, stolen, or destroyed, the Company shall execute and deliver,
in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation of a mutilated Note, or
in lieu of or in substitution for a lost, stolen, or destroyed Note, a new
promissory note for the then outstanding principal amount of this Note so
mutilated, lost, stolen, or destroyed, but only upon receipt of evidence
(which may consist of a signed affidavit of the Holder) of such loss, theft,
or destruction of this Note, the ownership thereof, and indemnity with
respect to any claim pursuant to this Note, all reasonably satisfactory to the
Company.

8\. _Other Matters_  

(a) _Modification; Waiver; Remedies; Transfer_. Company may not assign
performance of this Note. This Note may be amended, modified, superseded,
canceled, renewed or extended, and the terms hereof may be waived, only by a
written instrument signed by the Company and the Holder. Any waiver by the
Company or the Holder of a breach of any provision of this Note shall
not operate as or be construed to be a waiver of any other breach of such
provision or of any breach of any other provision of this Note. The failure of
the Company or the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this
Note on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive
that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that
term or any other term of this Note. No delay on the part of any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof or hereof, nor shall any waiver on the part of any party of any right,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise hereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege hereunder. The rights and
remedies provided herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which any party may otherwise have at law or in equity. This Note may
be sold, assigned, transferred or conveyed, by pledge or otherwise by Holder.

(b) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing, shall be given by one or more of the following means and shall be
deemed given: (i) when delivered, if delivered in person, (ii) upon
confirmation of receipt, if transmitted by facsimile or electronic mail, (iii)
three (3) Business Days after mailing, if mailed by certified or registered
mail (return receipt requested), or (iv) on the Business Day on which
delivered, (or, if not delivered on a Business Day, on the next Business Day),
if delivered by an express courier (with confirmation). In each case, all
notices and other communications hereunder shall be made at the partys
address set forth in the Purchase Agreement (or at such other address as such
party shall deliver to the other party by like notice).

 

(c) _Severability_. If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable, the balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any
provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless
remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances.

 

(d) _Headings_. The headings in this Note are solely for convenience of
reference and shall be given no effect in the construction or interpretation
of this Note.

 



3 (e) _Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(i) This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws
of the State of New York without regard to conflicts-of-law principles that
would require the application of any other Law.

(ii) The Company irrevocably submits and by its acceptance hereof the Holder
shall be deemed to irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the
County of New York, State of New York and the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York in any Action arising out of or relating to
this Note, and hereby irrevocably agrees or is deemed to irrevocably agree,
as applicable, that all claims in respect of such Action may be heard and
determined in such state or federal court. The Company irrevocably waives and
by its acceptance hereof the Holder shall be deemed to irrevocably waive, to
the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such Action. Further, the Company irrevocably
agrees and by its acceptance hereof the Holder shall be deemed to irrevocably
agree, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that a final and unappealable
judgment against it in any Action contemplated above shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States
by suit on the judgment, a certified copy of which shall be conclusive
evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

 

(iii) THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF THE
HOLDER SHALL BE DEEMED TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS NOTE. THIS
WAIVER HAS BEEN MADE WITH THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL AND WITH A FULL UNDERSTANDING
OF THE LEGAL CONSEQUENCES THEREOF AND SHALL SURVIVE THE REPAYMENT OF THIS
NOTE.

 

(f) _Waiver of Demand, Etc_. Except as otherwise specifically set forth
herein, the Company hereby waives presentment for payment, protest and
demand, and notice of protest, demand and/or dishonor and nonpayment of this
Note, notice of any Event of Default, and all other notices or demands
otherwise required by applicable Law that the Company may lawfully waive. The
Company expressly agrees that this Note, or any payment hereunder, may be
extended from time to time, without in any way affecting the liability of the
Company hereunder. No unilateral consent or waiver by the Holder with respect
to any action or failure to act which, without consent, would constitute a
breach of any provision of this Note shall be valid and binding unless in
writing and signed by the Holder.

 

(g) _Saving Clause_. This Note is subject to the express condition that at no
time shall the Company be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance due hereunder at a rate which could subject Holder to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the maximum
interest rate which the Company is permitted by applicable Law to contract or
agree to pay. If by the terms of this Note, the Company is at any time
required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance due hereunder,
at a rate in excess of such maximum rate, the interest rate shall be deemed to
be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous payments in
excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction
of principal and not on account of the interest due hereunder notwithstanding
the other provisions hereof.

 



4 (h) _Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness_. This Note and any
amendments, waivers, consents or supplements hereto may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all taken
together shall constitute a single contract. This Note constitutes the entire
contract between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect thereto. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Note by facsimile or in electronic (i.e., "pdf" or "tif") format shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Note.

(i) _Tax Withholding_. No U.S. federal, state or local tax withholding shall
be made with respect to payments to Holder under this Note, so long as the
Holder shall provide the Company with a properly completed and valid IRS Form
W-9 or Form W-8 (or any successor forms), as applicable, which remains
accurate, and based on such IRS form the Company shall not be required to
withhold with respect to such payments.

 

(j) _Defined Terms_. For purposes of this Note, "Senior Credit Facility" means
(a) that certain Credit Agreement dated as of May 30, 2014 among the Company,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders
and parties thereto, as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to
time, and (b) any renewals, extensions, modifications and refundings of any
commitments, loans, advances or indebtedness under such Credit Agreement.

(k) _SEC Filings_. The Company represents and warrants to the holder that all
public filings made by the Company with the U.S. Securities Exchange
Commission when and as made shall not include any untrue statement of a
material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

 

(l) _Holder Representation_. Holder represents that it has not obtained this
Note for purpose of resale or distribution of this Note or any interest
therein.
