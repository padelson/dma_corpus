| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 5.1(A), 5.1(D) or
5.1(E), or because Buyer commits a material breach of Buyer\'s obligations
under this Agreement or otherwise fails, refuses, or is unable for any reason

Seller\'s sole remedy against Buyer for such failure to close. 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 5.1(C), Buyer shall be
entitled, as Buyer\'s sole and exclusive remedy, to receive from Seller a
refund of the Deposit. 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

If Buyer terminates this Agreement because the Closing does not occur due to a
material breach by Seller of Seller\'s obligations under this Agreement, and
such breach is (i) not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice
by Buyer to Seller of such breach or (ii) by its nature cannot be cured prior
to the Final Closing Date, and provided that Buyer is without fault for such
failure, refusal, or inability by Seller to fulfill such obligations, Buyer
shall be entitled, as Buyer\'s sole and exclusive remedy, to elect one of the
following remedies: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Receive from Seller a refund of the Deposit. 
| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Not receive a refund of the Deposit, and seek specific performance of
Seller\'s obligations to sell the Assets to Buyer under the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, in lieu of all other remedies. In the event

Buyer must do so by filing the appropriate documents to commence dispute
resolution in accordance with Section 19 no later than the earlier of thirty
(30) days following the expiration of the cure period described in Section
5.3(E) and the Final Closing Date. If Buyer is unsuccessful in obtaining
specific performance of Seller\'s obligations to sell the Assets to Buyer
through the dispute resolution process provided for in Section 19, Buyer shall
not be entitled to then receive from Seller a refund of the Deposit. Nothing
contained herein shall be deemed an admission by Seller that specific
performance is an appropriate remedy for Seller\'s alleged breach. 

| 
---|--- 

(F)

|

If the Closing does not occur under circumstances described in Section 5.3(C),
Seller and Buyer acknowledge and agree that: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

The Deposit is a reasonable estimate by the Parties of Seller\'s actual
damages, including the value of Seller\'s holding the Assets off the market
for the period governed by this Agreement, and that the extent of actual
damages to Seller occasioned by failure to close would be extremely
impracticable to ascertain. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Payment of such liquidated damages are reasonable and do not constitute a
penalty. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

The payment of such sum shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in lieu of any

DUTY TO MITIGATE. Buyer shall take all reasonable steps to avoid, minimize or
mitigate any loss, liability or damage which may give rise to a Claim,

BUYER REVIEW OF ASSETS 

| 
---|--- 

11.1

|

Conduct of Investigation of Assets. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

During the Review Period, Buyer and its accountants, engineers and other
representatives and advisors, during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance Notice may, at Buyer\'s sole expense and risk, have reasonable access
to the Assets and the files, books, records, documents, and other information
relating thereto (other than certain privileged documents, confidential Third-
Party documents and personnel file records and evaluative records pertaining
to employees), without express or implied warranty of any kind regarding the
accuracy of such information. Subject to Section 11.1(B), Seller will provide
reasonable access to the Assets for such inspection of the Assets, including
the environmental and physical condition of the Assets and the Environmental
Obligations, and will make available for inspection and copying by Buyer
originals or true and complete copies (at Seller\'s discretion) of any
documents relating to the foregoing, including the documents listed in any
Schedule. Prior to any such access, Buyer shall notify Seller of its desire
for such access, and Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and determine
a mutually acceptable time and date for such access. All documents or
information obtained shall be subject to the confidentiality provisions of
this Agreement. Buyer\'s inspections shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of the Assets, shall not damage the Assets in any
respect, shall not be invasive or destructive in any respect without the prior
written consent of Seller and shall be conducted in accordance with standards
customarily employed in the industry and in compliance with all governmental
laws, rules and regulations. In respect of these rights, Buyer acknowledges
each of the following: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Any access to Seller-operated Assets or Seller\'s data is given as an
accommodation only, at Buyer\'s sole cost, risk and expense, that Seller makes
no representations whatsoever as to the accuracy, completeness, or reliability
of any such information so, or otherwise, disclosed to or obtained by Buyer. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Buyer relies and depends on and uses any and all such information, review or
inspection exclusively and entirely at its own risk and without any recourse
to Seller whatsoever. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
Buyer conduct internal inspections of out of service tanks situated on the
Real Property, conduct any sampling, boring, drilling or other invasive
investigations activities (including soil borings, test pits and groundwater
testing) or have any communications whether oral, written, electronic, or
otherwise with any Government Authority specifically with respect to the
Assets without the prior written consent of Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

Buyer\'s violation of Section 11.1(B) will constitute a material breach of
this Agreement and just cause for Seller\'s immediate Termination pursuant to
Section 5.3(C) without penalty of any kind to Seller. Seller\'s right to
terminate this Agreement shall be in addition to any other causes of action
and remedies 

that may be available to Seller under law or equity or this Agreement and
shall not in any way limit Seller\'s other rights against Buyer. Following
each such entry by Buyer or its agents or contractors with respect to any such
inspections, Buyer shall promptly restore, or cause to be restored, the Assets
to their original condition as existed immediately prior to any such
inspections.

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in all reasonable respects, but at no out-
of-pocket cost to Seller, in making any inspections pursuant to this Section
11.1. 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

Buyer hereby defends, indemnifies and holds harmless each of the operators of
the Assets and Seller Parties from and against any and all Claims actually
resulting from the access permitted pursuant to this Section 11.1 and the
related due diligence activity conducted by Buyer or any of Buyer\'s
representatives with respect to the Assets, even if such Claims arise out of
or result from, solely or in part, the sole, active, passive, concurrent or
comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of law of
or by a Seller Party, excepting only claims actually resulting from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of a Seller Party. The provisions of this
Section 11.1 shall survive the Termination. 

| 
---|--- 

11.2

|

Insurance Required. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

Buyer shall cause all persons and entities performing inspections at Buyer\'s
request to maintain adequate and appropriate insurance in the following: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Workers\' Compensation and Employer\'s Liability Insurance covering Buyer\'s
liability for all Claims arising out of bodily injury, death, or occupational
disease to its employees. Such insurance must comply with applicable laws
where the inspection work is performed and, if applicable, the states,
provinces and/or countries of residence of Buyer personnel performing the
inspections. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

General or Public Liability (third party, bodily injury and property damage)
Insurance including coverage for Buyer\'s indemnity obligations to indemnitees
for third party, bodily injury and property damage under this Agreement,
products and completed operations, and sudden and accidental pollution. The
policy must contain a cross liability or severability of interest provision
and must include coverage for all areas where the inspection of the Assets is
to be performed. The policy limit must not be less than Five Million U.S.
Dollars (US$5,000,000) per occurrence. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

If performance of the inspections requires Buyer to use motor vehicles, Buyer
shall maintain, or require owners of the motor vehicles to maintain,
Automobile Liability Insurance (including third party, bodily injury and
property damage) extending to all vehicles used in the performance of the
inspection of the Assets. The policy limit for this insurance must not be less
than One Million U.S. Dollars (US$1,000,000) or its currency equivalent, per
occurrence. 
| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Before undertaking any inspections, Buyer (i) will deliver to Seller written
evidence establishing to Seller\'s reasonable satisfaction that such adequate
and appropriate insurance is being maintained and (ii) shall cause Seller to
be named as an additional insured or an insured principal to the extent of
Buyer\'s indemnity obligations to indemnitees for third party bodily injury
and property damage pursuant to Section 11.1(E). 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

Unless prohibited by applicable law, waivers of subrogation in favor of Seller
must be included in the insurance required by Section 11.2(A)(1) to the extent
of Buyer\'s indemnity obligation to indemnitees for Buyer\'s employees under
this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

Buyer shall provide Seller with certificates of insurance or other documentary
evidence, satisfactory to Seller, of the insurance and endorsements required
under Section 11.2(A). Seller\'s acceptance of this certificate does not
constitute a waiver, release or modification of any of the insurance coverages
and endorsements required under Section 11.2. 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

Buyer is solely responsible for payment of all deductibles or self-insured
retentions that are applicable to Buyer\'s insurance, including all
deductibles or self-insured retentions applicable to coverage of Claims made
against indemnitees for which Buyer is responsible under this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

11.3

|

Alleged Title Defects. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

Notice. If during the Review Period, Buyer identifies any Alleged Title Defect
that exceeds the Individual Title Deductible and that was not reasonably
discernible from the materials set out in the Data Room as it existed at the
expiration of the Review Period or from other written materials or information
provided Buyer by Seller prior to the expiration of the Review Period, Buyer
may notify Seller in writing at any time on or prior to the expiration of the
Review Period. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Right to Cure. Seller shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
attempt, at its sole cost, to cure at any time prior to the Closing (the "Cure
Period"), any Alleged Title Defects of which it has been advised by Buyer. If
Seller elects to cure any Alleged Title Defect with respect to Assets under
this Agreement or any alleged title defect with respect to the "Assets" under
the Terminal Interests ASPA, the Closing shall be extended, as necessary,
until the date which is five (5) Business Days following Seller\'s completion
of such cure, provided, that in no event shall Closing be extended beyond a
date which is ninety (90) days after the originally scheduled Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

Remedies for Alleged Title Defects. Subject to Seller\'s right to dispute the
existence of an Alleged Title Defect asserted by Buyer, in the event that any
Alleged Title Defect timely asserted by Buyer is not waived in writing by
Buyer or cured on or before the last day of the Cure Period, Seller shall,
subject to Section 11.3(E), have the option to elect one of the following
remedies: 
| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Subject to the Individual Title Deductible and the Aggregate Deductible, a
reduction in the Purchase Price by the value of the Alleged Title Defect. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Indemnification of Buyer by Seller against all liability resulting from such
Alleged Title Defect pursuant to an indemnity agreement reasonably agreeable
to the Parties, in which case the Purchase Price shall not be reduced. 

| 
---|--- 

(D)

|

Exclusive Remedy. This Section 11.3 shall be the exclusive right and remedy of
Buyer with respect to any Alleged Title Defect, Seller\'s failure to have
defensible title or any other title matter with respect to any Asset. 

| 
---|--- 

(E)

|

Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in no
event shall there be any adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
provided by Seller (or NWTC) for any individual Alleged Title Defect under
this Agreement or the Terminal Interests ASPA for which the value of such
Alleged Title Defect under this Agreement or the Terminal Interests ASPA does
not exceed One Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$100,000) (the "Individual
Title Deductible"). In addition, in no event shall there be any adjustments to
the Purchase Price or other remedies provided by Seller (or NWTC) for any
Alleged Title Defect under this Agreement or the Terminal Interests ASPA that
exceeds the Individual Title Deductible unless the value of all such Alleged
Title Defects under this Agreement and the Terminal Interests ASPA that exceed
the Individual Title Deductible, in the aggregate, excluding any Alleged Title
Defects cured by Seller, exceeds three and one-half percent (3.5%) of the
Consolidated Purchase Price (the "Aggregate Deductible"), after which point
Buyer shall be entitled to adjustments to the Purchase Price or other remedies
only with respect to such Alleged Title Defects under this Agreement in excess
of such Aggregate Deductible. 

| 
---|--- 

11.4

|

Casualty or Condemnation Loss. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

If prior to the Closing Date any portion of the Assets or the "Assets" under
the Terminal Interests ASPA is damaged or destroyed by Casualty Loss
("Consolidated Casualty Loss"), the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Terminal Interests ASPA shall nevertheless close. In the
event that the aggregate amount the Consolidated Casualty Losses is reasonably
determined by Seller to be less than Four Million U.S. Dollars (US$4,000,000),
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Terminal Interests
ASPA shall nevertheless close and Seller shall have no obligation regarding
the casualty. In the event that the aggregate amount of losses resulting from
the Consolidated Casualty Losses is reasonably determined by Seller to be
equal to or greater than Four Million U.S. Dollars (US$4,000,000), Seller, at
Seller\'s sole discretion, shall select one of the following options which
shall apply to the Consolidated Casualty Losses: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Seller may cause the Assets affected by such Casualty Losses to be repaired or
restored to at least their condition prior to such Casualty 

Losses, at Seller\'s sole cost, as promptly as reasonably practicable (which
work may extend after the Closing Date).

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Seller may determine to reduce the Purchase Price or the "Purchase Price"
under the Terminal Interests ASPA, as applicable, by the amount of the
applicable Casualty Loss as reasonably determined by Seller, provided,
however, in such event: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

The Parties shall select an independent, Third-Party appraiser to review and
confirm the amount of the Casualty Loss to be applied to the reduction in
Purchase Price, and provided. 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

Such process shall not delay the Closing Date.. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

If after the Effective Date but prior to the Closing Date, any portion of the
Assets is taken in condemnation or under right of eminent domain by any
Government Authority, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall
nevertheless close. In such event, Seller shall, at Closing, pay to Buyer all
sums paid to Seller or its Affiliates by Third Parties by reason of such
taking and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to
all of Seller\'s or its Affiliates\' right, title and interest (if any) in
insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties arising
out of the taking. 

| 
---|--- 

(C)

|

If any action for condemnation or taking under right of eminent domain is
pending or threatened with respect to any Asset or portion thereof after the
Effective Date, but no taking of such Asset or portion thereof occurs prior to
the Closing Date, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall
nevertheless close and Seller, at Closing, shall assign, transfer and set over
to Buyer or subrogate Buyer to all of Seller\'s or its Affiliates\' right,
title and interest (if any) in such taking, including any insurance claims,
unpaid awards and other rights against Third Parties arising out of the
taking, insofar as they are attributable to the Assets threatened to be taken.

|

COVENANTS 

| 
---|--- 

12.1

|

Operation of Assets Prior to Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

During the Interim Period, Seller, in its sole discretion, shall use, operate
and maintain the Assets in substantially the same manner in which they have
been used, operated and maintained prior to the Effective Date. In addition,
Seller shall do the following: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Operate the Assets in the ordinary course of business. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

Not sell, assign or encumber (except for Permitted Encumbrances) any portion
of the Assets other than the sale in the ordinary course of the operations of
other items having a per item fair market value of less than One Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars ($100,000) of materials, supplies, spare parts,
furniture, motor vehicles, rolling stock, tools, implements, appliances,
machinery, equipment, improvements or other tangible personal property or
fixtures forming a part of the Assets. 
| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

The provisions set forth in Section 12.1(A) do not apply, and Seller is
entitled to act, or refrain from acting, in such a manner as Seller elects
without reference to Buyer or the provisions of Section 12.1(A), in respect of
any of the following circumstances: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

An act, omission or other matter expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
including the taking of any steps necessary to satisfy the Conditions
Precedent. 

| 
---|--- 

(2)

|

An act, omission or other matter undertaken in the event of emergency or where
otherwise necessary, in the opinion of Seller, to safeguard any personnel or
assets of Seller, including the Assets. 

| 
---|--- 

(3)

|

Not assign, transfer, amend or terminate any material Assigned Contract or
Applicable Permit without the Buyer\'s prior written consent, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

| 
---|--- 

12.2

|

Assigned Contracts. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

At and effective as of the Closing, Seller shall assign all rights and
delegate performance of all its duties to Buyer under the Assigned Contracts,
and Buyer shall assume and agree to perform all duties of Seller under each
such Assigned Contracts. Such assumption by Buyer includes its assumption of
any termination charges associated with a termination of any such Assigned
Contract made after the Closing. No contracts relating to the ownership and/or
operation of the Assets shall be assigned by Seller under this Agreement other
than the Assigned Contracts. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Notwithstanding Section 12.2(A), the Assigned Contracts described in Schedule
4 - Assigned Contracts as requiring consent from Third Parties (other than
Customary Post Closing Consents) as a condition to any such transfer or
assignment shall not be transferred or assigned unless the proper consent
shall have been obtained. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate and shall undertake
promptly after the Effective Date such action as may be required to satisfy
any such notice or consent requirements as of the Closing Date, but at no out-
of-pocket cost to Seller. If Seller fails to obtain a consent (other than a
Customary Post Closing Consent) prior to the Closing and the failure to obtain
such consent would cause (i) the assignment of such Asset to Buyer to be void
or (ii) termination of the Assigned Contract under the express terms thereof,
then the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such failed consent shall be
excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer. For a period of 90 days
following Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to attempt to obtain any such consent. If such consent is obtained
within such period, then Seller shall convey to Buyer the Asset (or portion
thereof) which was excluded from the Assets. Until such consent is obtained,
Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer the benefits
and obligations of the affected Assets so long as the foregoing does not
result in the breach of any underlying Assigned Contract. 

| 
---|--- 

12.3

|

Applicable Permits. 
| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

Buyer and Seller shall undertake reasonable efforts, each as to matters within
its control, but at no out-of-pocket cost to Seller, to cause the Applicable
Permits to be transferred or reissued in favor of Buyer as of the Closing
Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

At and effective as of the transfer or reissuance of each such Applicable
Permit, Buyer shall assume and agree to perform all duties under such
Applicable Permit from and after the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Applicable Permits described in Schedule 5 - Applicable Permits as
requiring notice, consent, or action by any Government Authority with
competent jurisdiction or Third Party ("Applicable Permit Consent
Requirements") shall not be transferred or assigned until and unless the
proper notice or consent shall have been satisfied. 

| 
---|--- 

12.4

|

Assignment of Right of Way Interests. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

At and effective as of the Closing, Seller shall assign all rights and
delegate performance of all its duties to Buyer under the Right of Way
Interests, and Buyer shall assume and agree to perform all duties of Seller
under such Right of Way Interests, pursuant to one or more Assignment and
Assumption of Right of Way Interests in substantially the form of Exhibit C -
Form of Assignment and Assumption of Right of Way Interests. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Notwithstanding Section 12.4(A), the Right of Way Interests described in
Schedule 2 - Right of Way Interests as requiring consent from Third Parties as
a condition to any such transfer or assignment shall not be transferred or
assigned unless the proper consent shall have been obtained except to the
extent any such consent is a Customary Post Closing Consent. Seller and Buyer
shall cooperate and shall undertake promptly after the Effective Date such
action as may be required to satisfy any such notice or consent requirements
as of the Closing Date, but at no out-of-pocket cost to Seller. If Seller
fails to obtain any such consent (other than a Customary Post Closing Consent)
prior to the Closing and the failure to obtain such consent would cause (i)
the assignment of such Right of Way Interest to Buyer to be void or (ii)
termination of the Right of Way Interest under the express terms thereof, then
the Asset (or portion thereof) subject to such failed consent shall be
excluded from the Assets to be conveyed to Buyer. For a period of one hundred
eighty (180) days following Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to attempt to obtain any such consent. If such
consent is obtained within such period, then Seller shall convey to Buyer the
Right of Way Interest (or portion thereof) which was excluded from the Assets.
Until such consent is obtained, Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts
to provide to Buyer the benefits and obligations of the affected Assets so
long as the foregoing does not result in the breach of any underlying
agreement granting such Right of Way Interest. 

| 
---|--- 

12.5

|

HSR Clearance. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

Within three (3) Business Days after the Effective Date, all Parties shall
promptly file with the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the
Department of Justice ("DOJ"), as applicable, the required notification and
report forms due under the HSR Act and shall as promptly as practicable
furnish 

any supplemental information that may be requested in connection therewith.
Any such notification and report form and additional information, if any,
submitted to the FTC or the DOJ shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act. Each of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the
other such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary
under the HSR Act. Buyer shall pay any HSR Act filing fee as provided by
statute. Otherwise, Seller and Buyer shall each pay their own preparation
costs and expenses and shall take all reasonable steps to achieve early
termination of applicable HSR Act waiting periods. Each of Buyer and Seller
shall keep the other apprised in a prompt manner of the status and substance
of any communications with, and inquiries or request for additional
information from, the FTC and the DOJ and shall comply promptly with any such
inquiry or request. Seller and Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause any
waiting period under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
herein to expire or terminate at the earliest time that is reasonably
practicable and will request "early termination" with respect to the waiting
period under the HSR Act. If the waiting period under the HSR Act has not
expired at such time as the other conditions precedent set forth in Section 14
have been satisfied or otherwise waived, either Party may extend the Closing
by up to ninety (90) days (the "HSR Extension"). In the event that Buyer
reasonably determines that the transactions contemplated by the terms of this
Agreement do not require filing under the HSR Act, Buyer shall provide a
letter representing that filing is not required in a form reasonably
acceptable to Seller.

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are enjoined other than
through a temporary restraining order (whether preliminarily or permanently)
as a result of any injunction or other order in any action or proceeding
brought by any Government Authority that seeks to prevent the Closing of this
transaction as a violation of any antitrust law as long as the basis of the
court order is not solely a violation of Section 7A of the HSR Act, Buyer will
make all necessary efforts to effect the dissolution or lifting of any such
injunction or other order and to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section
14.3(A). 

| 
---|--- 

12.6

|

PHMSA Audit. In the event that the PHMSA Audit results in any financial or
other responsibilities, the following shall apply: 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

Seller shall pay any monetary fines that are imposed for operations that
occurred prior to the Closing Date or for any improvements required to comply
with the PHMSA Audit prior to the Closing Date. 

| 
---|--- 

(B)

|

Buyer shall pay for any improvements required by the PHMSA Audit to comply
with any Notice of Probable Violation ("NOPV") after the Closing Date, and if
applicable, any fines due attributable to Buyer\'s failure to comply with any
such NOPV. 

| 
---|--- 

12.7

|

Further Assurances. Seller and Buyer agree to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary
(including executing and delivering, from time to time, at the request of the
other all such further conveyance documents, assignments and further
assurances as reasonably may be required) to 

consummate the purchase and sale contemplated by this Agreement, provided that
no such action or execution and delivery of such documents, assignments and
further assurances shall increase or otherwise modify or affect the duties or
obligations of the Parties. Each Deed and Assignment and Assumption of Right
of Way Interests shall be promptly recorded by Buyer at Buyer\'s expense
following execution and delivery. Buyer agrees to grant such easements to
Seller or its Affiliates on reasonable terms at or following the Closing to
the extent such easements are reasonably required for Seller\'s continuing
operation of its crude facility or related operations following the completion
of the SLS Project.

| 
---|--- 

12.8

|

Notification of Certain Matters. 

| 
---|--- 

(A)

|

During the Interim Period, Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify each other
of any of the following: 

| 
---|--- 

(1)

|

Any information that indicates that any representation or warranty contained
herein was not true and correct as of the Effective Date or will not be true
and correct as of the Closing Date, if applicable.

(3)

During the Interim Period, Seller shall confer on reasonable request (but no
more often than one time every two weeks) with one or more Specified
Individuals of Buyer to report on operational matters and to report the
general status of ongoing operations at the Facilities. The Specified
Individuals of Buyer are listed in Schedule 11 - Specified Individuals. 

|

Proprietary Technical Information. Seller may remove all proprietary technical
information in written form that is owned by a Third Party or is in use at the
Facilities and is proprietary to Seller or its Affiliates and is not
specifically included as part of this sale and listed in Schedule 1 -

|

Waiver. No waiver by either Party of this Agreement\'s terms, provisions or
conditions shall be effective unless specifically evidenced in writing and
signed by or on behalf of the Party granting such waiver. A Party\'s failure
to pursue remedies for breach of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver
by such Party of any breach of this Agreement or raise any defense against
Claims against a Party for breach of this Agreement. The waiver or failure to
require the performance of any covenant or obligation contained in this
Agreement or to pursue remedies for breach of this Agreement does not waive a
later breach of that covenant or obligation. 

| 
---|--- 

20.4

|

Severability. Each provision of this Agreement is severable and if any
provision is determined to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal under any
existing or future law by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction or
by operation of any applicable law, this invalidity, unenforceability or
illegality does not impair the operation of or affect those portions of this
Agreement that are valid, enforceable and legal, so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision or part thereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

---|--- 

20.5

reason, all provisions in this Agreement containing representations,
warranties, releases, defense obligations and indemnities, and all provisions
relating to audit, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, insurance,
disclaimer of certain remedies, limitations of liability, ownership or use or
return of Confidential Information, dispute resolution and governing law, and
all causes of action which arose prior to completion or Termination, survive
indefinitely until, by their respective terms, they are no longer operative or
are otherwise limited by an applicable statute of limitations. Subject to
Section 9, each of the obligations and undertakings set out in this Agreement
which is not fully performed at Closing shall continue in force after Closing. 

| 
---|--- 

20.6

|

Interest. Without prejudice to any other rights available to a Party hereunder
or at law, if any amount payable hereunder is not paid when due, the
defaulting Party shall pay interest on such amount from the due date of
payment (after as well as before judgment) until the date of payment (both
dates inclusive) at a rate equal to Prime Rate plus one percent calculated on
a daily basis using simple interest. 

| 
---|--- 

20.7

|

Assignments. This Agreement shall be binding on and inure for the benefit of
the rightful successors and permitted assigns of the Parties, but the rights,
duties and obligations of Buyer under this Agreement shall not be assigned
without Seller\'s prior written consent to the assignment, provided that in
the event of an assignment by Buyer to a wholly-owned Affiliate prior to
Closing, such consent shall not be required provided, further, that Buyer
provides advance notice of such assignment. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Buyer shall remain responsible to Seller for all obligations,
indemnities and liabilities due Seller under this Agreement, unless and until
expressly released by Seller. 

| 
---|--- 

20.8

|

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts,
each of which will be deemed an original of this Agreement, and which together

and the resulting Agreement must not be construed more severely against one of
the Parties than against the other.
