hand, as of immediately prior to the Valuation Time; (e) a valid and duly
executed IRS Form W-9, dated as of the Closing Date, from Seller; (f) a
certificate of an authorized officer of Seller as to compliance with the

Section 2.5 Deliveries by Buyer. (a) At the Closing, Buyer will deliver or
cause to be delivered to Seller the following: (i) the Ancillary Agreements,
duly executed by Buyer; and (ii) a certificate of an authorized officer of
Buyer as to compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) and
Section 7.2(b). (b) At the Closing, Buyer will pay and deliver to Seller an
amount equal to the Initial Purchase Price in accordance with Section 2.2(b).
Section 2.6 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment. (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Closing Date, and in any event within 60 days thereof,
Buyer will prepare and deliver to Seller a statement setting forth in
reasonable detail the Buyer's calculation of (i) the Company Indebtedness,
(ii) Net Working Capital, (iii) the resulting Net Working Capital Adjustment,
(iv) the aggregate amount of Company Transaction Expenses, and (v) the Excess
Cash (such statement being referred to as the "Buyer Closing Statement"). The
Buyer Closing Statement shall also include a certification, signed by an
officer of Buyer, as to whether a Specified Producer Base Purchase Price
Adjustment Reversal Amount is due to Seller pursuant to Section 2.6(e) below.
The Buyer Closing Statement, the Final Closing Statement and the component
items thereof will be prepared and calculated in accordance with the
definitions set forth in this Agreement. Buyer will (1) permit, and will cause
the Company to permit, Seller and its advisors and representatives such access
to the books, records, properties, premises, work papers, personnel and other
information of the Company as is reasonably necessary to permit Seller and its
advisors and representatives to review the Buyer Closing Statement or to
address any dispute described in this Section 2.6 and (2) reasonably
cooperate, and will cause the Company to reasonably cooperate, with Seller and
its advisors and representatives in connection with such review or any
dispute, including providing as soon as practicable all such information
necessary in connection with the review of the Buyer Closing Statement as is
reasonably requested by Seller or its advisors or representatives, in each
case subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6.2(d). The Parties agree
that the purpose of preparing and calculating the Net Working Capital is to
measure changes in such amount from the Net Working Capital Target without the
introduction of new or different accounting methods, policies, practices,
procedures, classifications, judgments or estimation methodologies from the
Accounting Principles or the methodology set forth on Exhibit 1.1(a)-A. The
Buyer Closing Statement and the calculation of the amounts therein will
entirely disregard (x) any and all effects on the assets and liabilities of
the Company or the Covered Business as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby or of any financing or refinancing arrangements entered
into at any time by Buyer or any other transaction entered into by Buyer in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (y) any of the plans, transactions or changes that Buyer intends
to initiate or make or cause to be initiated or made after the Closing with
respect to the Company or the Covered Business. (b) Seller will, within 45
days following its receipt of the Buyer Closing Statement (the "Review
Period"), accept or reject the Buyer Closing Statement submitted by Buyer. If
Seller disagrees with the Buyer Closing Statement or any calculation therein,
then Seller will give written notice to Buyer of such dispute, setting forth,
in reasonable detail, those items and amounts as to which Seller disagrees,
the basis for Seller's objections and Seller's calculation of the amount of
each disputed item within such 45-day period. Should Seller fail to provide
Buyer with a written notice of dispute within such 45-day period, Seller will
be deemed to agree with the Buyer Closing Statement 16 US 167664346 HB:
4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement021.jpg) 

(including the calculations included therein) delivered by Buyer, which shall
be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event
there is a dispute, Buyer and Seller will attempt in good faith to reconcile
their differences, and any written resolution by them as to any disputed
amounts will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. Any items agreed
to by Seller and Buyer in writing, together with any items not disputed or
objected to by Seller in a dispute notice, are collectively referred to herein
as the "Resolved Matters". If Seller and Buyer are unable to reach a
resolution with such effect within 30 days after the receipt by Buyer of
Seller's written notice of dispute, Seller and Buyer will submit the items
remaining in dispute (the "Unresolved Matters") for resolution to the Chicago,
Illinois office of PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if the Chicago, Illinois office
of PricewaterhouseCoopers is unwilling or unable to serve, to a nationally
recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (which
shall not be the primary auditor of either Buyer or Seller) (such identified
or selected firm, the "Independent Accountant"). The Independent Accountant
will act as an expert, and not an arbitrator, and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to issue its report as to all Unresolved Matters (and only
such matters) and the determination of the Adjustment Amounts within 30 days
after such dispute is referred to the Independent Accountant. The Independent
Accountant will not have the power to modify or amend any term or provision of
this Agreement. All communications between a party and the Independent
Accountant shall be in writing and shall be transmitted to the other party at
the same time they are transmitted to the Independent Accountant and neither
Buyer nor Seller shall have ex parte communications with the Independent
Accountant. The Independent Accountant's determination shall be based solely
on the written submissions of the parties and not an independent
investigation. With respect to each Unresolved Matter, the Independent
Accountant's determination, if not in accordance with the position of either
Seller or Buyer, will not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower,
of the amounts advocated by Seller or Buyer with respect thereto. The
Independent Accountant's final written determination will be conclusive and
binding upon the Parties. Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand,
will bear all costs and expenses incurred by them in connection with such
arbitration, except that the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
hereunder will be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other
hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of Unresolved Matters
submitted to the Independent Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such Party (as finally determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to
the total amount of such disputed items submitted. This provision will be
specifically enforceable by the Parties, and the decision of the Independent
Accountant in accordance with the provisions hereof will be final and binding
with respect to the matters so arbitrated and there will be no right of appeal
therefrom. (c) The "Final Closing Statement" will be (i) in the event that no
dispute notice is delivered by Seller to Buyer, or Seller notifies Buyer that
it has no such disputes or objections to the Buyer Closing Statement, in each
case prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Buyer Closing Statement
delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section 2.6(a); (ii) in the event
that a dispute notice is delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration
of the Review Period, the Buyer Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to Section 2.6(a), as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Seller
and Buyer in writing; or (iii) in the event that a dispute notice is delivered
by Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period and Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such dispute notice, the
Buyer Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to Section
2.6(a), as adjusted by the Independent Accountant to be consistent with the
Resolved Matters and the final determination of the Independent Accountant of
the Unresolved Matters in accordance with Section 2.6(b). In the event the
Final Closing Statement is determined (x) pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) of
the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer will prepare the Final Closing
Statement and calculate the Adjustment Amounts, if any, in each case in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items to Seller
within three (3) Business Days following the determination thereof or (y)
pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer 17 US
167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement022.jpg) 

and Seller shall cause the Independent Accountant to prepare the Final Closing
Statement and calculate the Adjustment Amounts, if any, based on the Final
Closing Statement, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver
such items to Seller and Buyer within three (3) Business Days following the
delivery of the final written determination of the Independent Accountant to
Seller and Buyer. (d) The parties agree to make the following payments (each,
an "Adjustment Amount") based upon the respective amounts set forth in the
Final Closing Statement: (i) if the Company Indebtedness is greater than the
Estimated Company Indebtedness, Seller will pay to Buyer the difference
between the Company Indebtedness and the Estimated Company Indebtedness; (ii)
if the Company Indebtedness is less than the Estimated Company Indebtedness,
Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the Estimated Company
Indebtedness and the Company Indebtedness; (iii) if the Net Working Capital
Adjustment is less than the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment, Seller
will pay to Buyer the difference between the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment and the Net Working Capital Adjustment; (iv) if the Net Working
Capital Adjustment is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the Net Working
Capital Adjustment and the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment; (v) if
the Company Transaction Expenses are greater than the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses, Seller will pay to Buyer the difference between the
Company Transaction Expenses and the Estimated Company Transaction Expenses;
(vi) if the Company Transaction Expenses are less than the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses, Buyer will pay to Seller the difference between the
Estimated Company Transaction Expenses and the Company Transaction Expenses;
(vii) if the Excess Cash is greater than the Estimated Excess Cash, Buyer will
pay to Seller the difference between the Excess Cash and the Estimated Excess
Cash; and (viii) if the Excess Cash is less than the Estimated Excess Cash,
Seller will pay to Buyer the difference between the Excess Cash and the
Estimated Excess Cash. (e) If a Specified Producer Base Purchase Price
Adjustment was made to the Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(ii) with respect to any Specified Producer, and such Specified Producer
executes and delivers to Buyer the Buyer New Hire Documents within the thirty
(30) day period after the Closing Date and does not repudiate or disavow such
Buyer New Hire Documents within such thirty (30) day period, then the
Specified Producer Base Purchase Price Adjustment attributable to such
Specified Producer, as set forth on Exhibit 2.2(d), shall be paid within five
(5) Business Days following the determination and delivery of the Final
Closing Statement (such amount, if any, the "Specified Producer Base Purchase
Price Adjustment Reversal Amount"). (f) The Adjustment Amount to be paid
pursuant to Section 2.6(d)(i)-(viii) and Section 2.6(e) will be netted so that
only Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, is required to make
a payment hereunder. Any payment required pursuant to Section 2.6(d) or
Section 2.6(e) will 18 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement023.jpg) 

be made within five (5) Business Days following the determination and delivery
of the Final Closing Statement. This Section 2.6 will be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to the determination of the
Purchase Price; provided, however, that in no event will Buyer or Seller be
entitled to any duplicative recovery as a result of the rights and remedies
afforded herein. Section 2.7 Method of Payment. All payments required under
this Article II or any other provision of this Agreement will be made in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account or bank
accounts designated in writing by the Person to which the applicable payment
is due. Section 2.8 Purchase Price Allocation. Within 90 days after the
Purchase Price has been deemed to be final pursuant to this Article II, Seller
will deliver to Buyer a schedule that reasonably allocates the Purchase Price
(together with any assumed Liabilities and any other items required to be
taken into account as purchase consideration for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes) among the assets of the Company in accordance with Sections 1060 and
338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation Schedule will be consistent with the
methodology set forth in Schedule 2.8. Buyer will have a period of 20 days
after the delivery of the Allocation Schedule (the "Response Period") to
present in writing to Seller notice of any objections Buyer may have to the
allocation set forth therein (an "Objections Notice"). Unless Buyer timely
objects, such Allocation Schedule will be binding on the Parties, absent
manifest error. If Buyer delivers an Objections Notice within the Response
Period, Buyer and Seller will negotiate in good faith and use all reasonable
best efforts to resolve such dispute in a manner consistent with the
methodology set forth in Schedule 2.8. If the Parties fail to agree within 15
days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, then the disputed items will
be resolved by the Independent Accountant in a manner consistent with the
methodology set forth in Schedule 2.8, whose determination will be final and
binding on the Parties. The Independent Accountant will resolve the dispute
within 30 days after the item has been referred to it. For purposes of this
Section 2.8, the costs, fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant will
be borne equally by Buyer and Seller. Except as otherwise required by a final
determination (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or similar
provision of applicable Tax Law), (a) Buyer and Seller will (and will cause
their respective Affiliates to) report the national, federal, state, and local
income and other Tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the purchase price allocation, as
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.8, and (b) neither Buyer nor
Seller will (and neither party will permit its respective Affiliates to) take
a position inconsistent with the purchase price allocation, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.8 on any Tax Return or filings
(including any forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 or 338 of
the Code); provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement will prevent a
Party from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Entity, or require a Party to litigate before any court any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Entity, in each case, arising out
of or challenging such purchase price allocation, as applicable. A final
Allocation Schedule shall be reflected in writing by the Parties no later than
180 days from the final Purchase Price determination date or within 15 days of
the above Independent Accountant determination. Each of Buyer and Seller will
cooperate with the other in preparing IRS Form 8594 or any equivalent
statements required by any Governmental Entity charged with the collection of
any income Tax for filing within a reasonable period before its filing due
date for the 2020 tax year. Section 2.9 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Tax Law. To the
extent amounts are so deducted and withheld by Buyer, such deducted and
withheld amounts (a) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity
and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. 19 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2

ARTICLE III REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE COMPANY Seller
hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as follows: Section 3.1 Organization.
(a) The Company is duly organized, validly existing and in current status
under the Laws of the State of Wisconsin. The Company has all requisite power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as conducted on the date hereof. The Company is duly qualified or
registered as a foreign business organization, as applicable, to transact
business under the Laws of each jurisdiction where the character of its
activities or the location of the properties owned or leased by it requires
such qualification or registration, except where the failure of such
qualification or registration would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has made available to the Buyer true
and complete copies of the Charter Documents of the Company, as in effect on
the date hereof. (b) Except for the Excluded Assets, and as set forth on
Schedule 3.1(b), (i) the Company does not engage in any activities and does
not have assets or liabilities arising out of, any business other than the
Covered Business, and (ii) Seller does not own any beneficial interest in, is
not a party to any Contract or transaction with, and does not otherwise have a
financial interest in any Client Account, except as set forth in Schedule
3.23. Section 3.2 Capitalization. The Equity Interests constitute all of the
issued and outstanding Equity Rights of the Company, are validly issued, fully
paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and are owned of record and
beneficially by Seller free and clear of any Lien other than restrictions on
transfer arising under state or federal securities laws. There are no options,
warrants, convertible securities or other rights or Contracts of any character
relating to the Equity Rights of the Company or obligating Seller to issue or
sell any Equity Rights of the Company. There are no outstanding obligations of
the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Rights of
the Company or to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in any other Person. Section 3.3 Subsidiaries and
Other Equity Rights. The Company does not have any Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.3, the Company does not own, of record or beneficially,
any Equity Rights in any Person. With respect to any Equity Right in any
Person owned of record or beneficially by the Company, Schedule 3.3 sets forth
(a) the type and class of such Equity Right, (b) the name of the issuer of
such Equity Right and (c) to the extent Known by the Seller, the percentage
ownership of all Equity Rights of the applicable issuer represented by such
Equity Right (delineated by type and/or class of Equity Right, to the extent
applicable). Seller has made available to Buyer true and complete copies of
the Charter Documents in the possession of Seller or the Company for each
entity in which the Company owns of record or beneficially an Equity Right,
and has made reasonable efforts to obtain from the issuer of such Equity Right
copies of any Charter Documents not in Seller's or the Company's possession.
Section 3.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.4 and for the Antitrust Clearances, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements to which it
is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do not and will not: (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the Charter Documents of the Seller or the Company; (b) require
any filing with, or the obtaining of any permit, authorization, consent,
waiver or approval of, any Governmental Entity; (c) violate, conflict with or
result 20 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement025.jpg) 

in a default (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) under, or
give rise to any right of modification, consent, approval, termination,
cancellation or acceleration under, or a loss of any benefits by the Company
under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Business Contract,
Insurance Contract or License; (d) violate any Law or Order applicable to the
Company, by which or to which any portion of the Company's properties or
assets is bound, or to the Covered Business and (e) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company, (or the Covered Business)
except for any Permitted Liens; excluding from the foregoing clauses (b) -
(e), such requirements, violations, conflicts, defaults or rights which would
not be material to the Company or the Covered Business, taken as a whole, and
would not materially and adversely affect the ability of Seller to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 3.5 Financial
Statements (a) The Financial Statements are attached as Schedule 3.5(a)(i).
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(a)(ii), the Financial Statements have been
prepared in all material respects in accordance with GAAP from the books and
records of the Company consistently applied throughout the periods indicated.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.5(a)(iii), each balance sheet included in
such Financial Statements (including any related notes and schedules) fairly
presents in all material respects the financial position of the Company or the
Covered Business (as applicable) as of the date of such balance sheet, and
each statement of income included in the Financial Statements (including any
related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
results of operations, as the case may be, of the Company or the Covered
Business (as applicable) for the periods set forth therein, in each case in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except
as otherwise noted therein and subject to normal and recurring year-end
adjustments (none of which are material) and the absence of notes. (b) The
Trust Cash as of the Balance Sheet Date (including reasonable detail regarding
the significant components thereof) is as set forth on Schedule 3.5(b). All
Trust Cash is held in accounts owned by the Company. (c) The information
contained in each Historical Production Spreadsheet is true and correct in all
material respects as of March 31, 2020, subject to de minimis deviations for
each individual Consultant covered thereby (which deviations are not material
in the aggregate, in any event). (d) Schedule 3.5(d) sets forth the aggregate
revenue assigned to the "house accounts" (i.e. the Client Accounts not
assigned to any Consultant) as of March 31, 2020, which aggregate amount was
$21,811,451 (the "Total House Account Amount"). Of the Total House Account
Amount, $7,841,638 has been, or after the date hereof may be, coded or
assigned to a Consultant. The remaining amount of the Total House Account
Amount (equal to $13,969,814) has not been coded or assigned to a Consultant
as of the date hereof (the "Non-Assignable House Account Amount"). (e) The
information contained in the Retirement Plan Consulting Business Spreadsheet
is true and correct in all material respects as of the date thereof, subject
to de minimis deviations (which deviations are not material in the aggregate,
in any event). (f) The Company and Seller maintain, and have each at all times
since June 30, 2018, maintained, a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient for a business such as the Covered Business, including to provide
reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations and (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary 21 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement026.jpg) 

to permit preparation of financial statements for the Covered Business in
conformity with GAAP. Neither the Company nor Seller (with respect to the
Covered Business) has ever identified any fraud by any management or other
employees who have a significant role in internal controls and, to Seller's
Knowledge, no such fraud has been alleged. Section 3.6 No Undisclosed
Liabilities. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6, the Company does not have
any Liabilities required to be shown in the Financial Statements in accordance
with GAAP, except (a) to the extent set forth on, reflected in, reserved
against or disclosed in the most recent balance sheet included in the
Financial Statements, (b) those Liabilities arising under this Agreement, (c)
those Liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course since the date of the most
recent balance sheet included in the Financial Statements and (d) other
Liabilities that are not material to the Company or to the Covered Business.
Section 3.7 Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.7,
since the Balance Sheet Date and through the date hereof, (a) the Covered
Business has been conducted in the Ordinary Course, (b) there has not been any
event, circumstance, change or effect that has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (c) the Company has not taken
any of the actions contrary to the obligations described in clauses (d), (e),
(g), (i), (j), (m), (n), (p) of Section 6.1. Section 3.8 Title To Assets.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.8, the Company has good and valid title, or
in the case of leased property has valid leasehold interests in, all property
and assets (whether real or personal), reflected in the Financial Statements
or acquired after the Balance Sheet Date (including, without limitation, all
Client Accounts and all records, files, data and other records related
thereto, subject in all respects to the rights of the underlying clients of
such Client Accounts), other than obsolete equipment sold or otherwise
disposed of in the Ordinary Course since the Balance Sheet Date. All such
properties and assets are free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted
Liens. As of Closing, the assets of the Company, together with the services or
rights to be provided by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement and the New Real Estate Leases, will constitute all the
assets that will be necessary for Buyer to continue to operate and conduct the
Covered Business immediately following the Closing as currently conducted.
Section 3.9 Real Property. (a) Schedule 3.9(a) lists the street address of
each parcel of real property owned by the Company as of the date hereof (the
"Owned Real Property"). As of the Closing, the Company will not own any real
property, including the Owned Real Property. (b) Schedule 3.9(b) sets forth a
correct and complete list of (i) all Contracts to which the Company is a party
as of the date hereof pertaining to the lease of the Leased Real Property
(each such Contract, a "Real Property Lease") and (ii) each office location
used in the Covered Business as of the date hereof. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.9(b) or as otherwise would not be material to the Company or the
Covered Business taken as a whole, the Company has a valid leasehold interest
in the Leased Real Property, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted
Liens. (c) With respect to each Real Property Lease, (i) the Company has not
subleased, licensed or otherwise granted anyone the right to use or occupy any
of the real property subject thereto, (ii) the Company has not collaterally
assigned or granted any other security interest in any such leasehold estate
or any interest therein (iii) the Company enjoys peaceful and undisturbed
possession of the premises thereunder. (d) Except in the Ordinary Course or as
set forth on Schedule 3.9(d), there are no condemnation or appropriation or
similar proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, 22 US 167664346
HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement027.jpg) 

threatened against any of the Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property or
the improvements thereon, which, if occurring, pertain to the Leased Real
Property or would have a Material Adverse Effect. The use and operation of the
Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property in the conduct of the Covered
Business do not violate in any material respect any Law, covenant, condition,
restriction, easement, license, permit or agreement. Section 3.10 Intellectual
Property; Privacy and Data Security. (a) Schedule 3.10(a) sets forth a list of
all Company Registered Intellectual Property, the owner of such item, and the
jurisdictions where each is registered (if any). To the Knowledge of Seller,
all Company Registered Intellectual Property and Seller Marks are valid,
subsisting, and enforceable, except as would not reasonably be expected to be
material to the Company or the Covered Business. (b) Except set forth on
Schedule 3.10(b), the Company is the exclusive owner of the material Company
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens,
or possesses adequate and valid rights to use the Company Intellectual
Property and Seller Marks in the Covered Business. The Company has paid all
maintenance fees, renewal fees or annuity expenses due for payment prior to
the Closing Date for maintenance of the Company Registered Intellectual
Property. (c) The Company has not granted any licenses or other agreements
granting any rights with respect to any Company Intellectual Property to any
Affiliate or third party, except in the Ordinary Course. (d) To the Knowledge
of Seller, neither the use of Company Intellectual Property or Seller Marks by
the Company nor the conduct of the Covered Business during the three (3) year
period prior to the Closing Date has misappropriated, infringed upon or
conflicted with any Intellectual Property rights of any third party in any
material respect. No Person has asserted a written claim (or, to the Knowledge
of Seller, otherwise threatened a claim) during the three (3) year period
prior to the Closing Date against the Company alleging that it has violated,
infringed on or otherwise improperly used the Intellectual Property rights of
such party. (e) To the Knowledge of Seller, no infringement, misappropriation,
or other violation of any material Company Intellectual Property by any third
party is occurring. To the Knowledge of Seller, each Person who contributed to
or was involved in the creation or development of any material Company
Intellectual Property has signed a valid and binding agreement sufficient to
transfer to the Company ownership of all right, title and interest of such
Persons in such Intellectual Property. (f) Since June 30, 2018, except as
would not be material to the Company or the Covered Business, taken as a
whole, the Company and Seller (with respect to the Covered Business) have (i)
implemented, enforced, and maintained appropriate safeguards, policies and
procedures related to the privacy and security of Personal Information under
applicable Laws, (ii) to Seller's Knowledge, complied with all Privacy
Obligations in all material respects, (iii) not received any notice or been
subject to any action or complaints from any Person, including a Governmental
Entity, asserting that the Company or the Covered Business is not in
compliance with applicable Privacy Obligations, and (iv) not experienced any
material loss, damage, or unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, use
or breach of security of any database containing Personal Information that is
or previously has been possessed or otherwise controlled by or on behalf of
the Company or the Covered Business, and (v) not received any notices,
inquiries, or complaints from any Person regarding any of the foregoing. 23 US
167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement028.jpg) 

(g) The Company and Seller (with respect to the Covered Business) (i) use
commercially reasonable measures to appropriately protect the confidentiality,
integrity and security of all Personal Information contained in any data
systems possessed or otherwise controlled by the Company or Seller (with
respect to the Covered Business) against any unauthorized use, access,
interruption, modification, or corruption, and (ii) maintain commercially
reasonable security, disaster recovery and business continuity plans,
procedures to protect Personal Information. Section 3.11 Litigation. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.11, since June 30, 2018, there has been no Action
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing against the
Company or relating to the Covered Business by or before any Governmental
Entity, which, if decided adversely would reasonably be likely to have a
material impact on the Company or the Covered Business. To Seller's Knowledge,

(iii) and will cause the officers of the Company to furnish Buyer with such
financial and operations data and other information with respect to the
Company and the Covered Business as Buyer may reasonably request and (iv) and
will cause the employees, counsel, financial advisors and other
representatives of the Company and Seller to cooperate with Buyer in its
investigation of the Company and the Covered Business; provided, however, that
any such investigation will be conducted during normal business hours under
the supervision of the applicable personnel of Seller or its Affiliates and in
such a manner as to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement and not interfere unreasonably with the operations
of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and its counsel,
environmental consultants, investment bankers, financial sources, lenders and
other representatives will not, prior to the Closing, conduct any
environmental assessments, studies, investigations, monitoring, or other
inquiries pertaining to Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances and
relating to the Leased Real Property, including any Phase I environmental site
assessment, Phase II environmental site assessment, or invasive sampling of
soil, groundwater, air, any other environmental media, or building materials
or equipment. Further, notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) Buyer will not have
access to personnel records of the Company relating to individual performance
or evaluation records, medical history, or other similar information the
disclosure of which is not permitted under applicable Law and which could
subject Seller or its Affiliates to risk of Liability and (B) Seller shall not
be required to provide or cause to be provided access to or disclose or cause
to be disclosed information where such access or disclosure would jeopardize
the attorney-client or other privilege, contravene any applicable Law after
taking into account whether the Buyer is willing to enter into a customary
joint defense agreement or similar arrangement, or with respect to
competitively sensitive information, whether a clean-team approach could
resolve any issues under applicable Law with disclosing such information. In
the event Seller does not provide access or information pursuant to (B) above,
Seller will provide notice to the Buyer that such information is being
withheld and Seller will cause the Company to use its reasonable best efforts
to communicate, to the extent feasible, the applicable information in a way
that will not violate the applicable privilege or applicable Law. (b) For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer's access to any information provided to it under
Section 6.2(a) shall be subject to Section 5.7. (c) All information furnished
or provided by Seller, the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives to Buyer or its representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether furnished before or after the date
of this Agreement) will be held subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, and
Buyer (and its Affiliates) shall at all times comply with all applicable
securities Laws in connection with its use of any such information. 42 US

 ![](abrcagreement047.jpg) 

(d) Following the Closing, Buyer agrees to (i) provide reasonable access to
the personnel of the Company to Seller and its authorized representatives and
(ii) give Seller and its authorized representatives reasonable access to the
books, records, work papers, offices and other facilities and properties of
the Company, in each case to the extent necessary for Seller to satisfy any
legal, accounting or regulatory obligation or similar reasonable business
purpose relating to the period on or before the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any such access to the personnel of the Company will be
conducted during normal business hours under the supervision of the applicable
personnel of Buyer or its Affiliates and in such a manner as to maintain the
confidentiality of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement and not interfere
unreasonably with the operations of the Company; provided, further, that Buyer
shall not be required to provide or cause to be provided access to or disclose
or cause to be disclosed information where such access or disclosure would
jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege, contravene any applicable
Law after taking into account whether the Seller is willing to enter into a
customary joint defense agreement or similar arrangement. In the event Buyer
does not provide access or information pursuant to the preceding sentence,
Buyer will provide notice to the Seller that such information is being
withheld and Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to communicate, to the
extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that will not violate the
applicable privilege or applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, all
information made available to Seller or its authorized representatives under
this Section 6.2(d) shall be subject to Section 6.12(e). Section 6.3 Consents
and Regulatory Filings. (a) The Parties will cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain all Licenses, consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications and Orders of Governmental Entities
and other third parties necessary, as promptly as practicable, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) making or
causing to be made all notifications, filings and submissions required to
obtain the Antitrust Clearance and (ii) obtaining the approvals required under
Sections 4001.253 and 4151.211 of the Texas Insurance Code. The Parties will
use their respective reasonable best efforts to supply any additional
information, including requests for production of documents and production of
witnesses for interviews or depositions, that may be requested by any
Governmental Entity for the purpose of obtaining Antitrust Clearances and
obtaining the approvals required under the Texas Insurance Code. In addition
to the foregoing, Buyer agrees to provide such information as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any third party whose consent or approval is sought in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. (b) Seller and Buyer will use their best
efforts to make all initial filings required under the HSR Act with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in all events such
filings shall be made within seven (7) Business Days following the date of
this Agreement, and will make any other appropriate filings pursuant to other
applicable Antitrust Laws, if any, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable. Each of Seller and
Buyer will promptly furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable cooperation as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary under the HSR
Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of Seller and Buyer will
promptly provide the other with copies of all written communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance of all oral communications) between each
of them, any of their respective Affiliates or any of its or their respective
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Seller
and Buyer will promptly notify the other of the receipt and content of any
oral or written communication, inquiries or requests for additional 43 US
167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement048.jpg) 

information it receives from any Governmental Entity in connection therewith
and will promptly (i) reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with
any filing or submission and in connection with any investigation or any
inquiry; (ii) provide the other with a description of the information provided
to any Governmental Entity with respect to any such oral or written
communication, inquiry or request; (iii) permit the other Party to review and
consider in good faith the other Party's reasonable comments in any
communication given by it to any Governmental Entity; and (iv) to the extent
practicable and permitted by such applicable Governmental Entity, give the
other Party or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in all
meetings, substantive telephone calls or conferences with any Governmental
Entity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
this Section 6.3), nothing contained herein shall require any party to
disclose to the other party (A) documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) and 4(d)
of the Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act or communications
regarding the same documents, (B) information submitted in response to any
request for additional information or documents which reveal such party's
negotiating objectives or strategies regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby, (C) information relating to business and investments of Buyer's
Affiliates other than USI Advantage Corp. and its Subsidiaries, (D) any
information for which disclosure is prohibited by any Governmental Entity or
(E) any information for which disclosure would waive applicable legal
privilege. (c) Neither Buyer nor Seller will, and each will cause its
respective Affiliates not to, take any action that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the approval of any Governmental Entity of any of
the aforementioned filings. (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, approvals, Orders or waivers of Governmental
Entities, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to enable
the Parties to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including (i) supplying promptly any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by a Governmental Entity pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other Antitrust Laws and (ii) agreeing to any restrictions or
limitations on any businesses, operations, assets or contractual freedoms of
any such businesses or operations (provided, that any such commitment or
transaction involving the Company (or any of its assets or business) may be
subject to the occurrence of the Closing). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
will take any and all actions necessary in order to remedy or otherwise
address the concerns (whether or not formally expressed) of any Governmental
Entity under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, including divesting,
disposing of, restricting, or holding separate all or a material portion of
the businesses or assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or the Covered
Business (each of the actions described in this Section 6.3(d), an "Antitrust
Concession"); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement (including Section 6.3(c) and Section 6.3(d)), nothing
contained in this Agreement shall be construed to require Buyer to cause any
Person to take any action other than USI Advantage Corp. and its controlled
Affiliates. (e) In connection with this Section 6.3, if any Action is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Laws, the Parties
will jointly (to the extent practicable) use their respective reasonable best
efforts to (i) oppose or defend against such Action and (ii) take such action
as necessary to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including by appeal if necessary of any Order that makes
illegal or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that any commitment 44 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement049.jpg) 

or transaction involving the Company (or any of its assets or business) may be
subject to the occurrence of the Closing. (f) If requested by Buyer, Seller
shall cause the Company to agree to any Antitrust Concession; provided that
(i) none of Seller's Affiliates (other than the Company) shall be required to
make any Antitrust Concession and (ii) neither Seller nor the Company shall be
required to agree to any Antitrust Concession that is not conditioned upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall
not, and shall not permit any of its Affiliates or the Company to, make or
agree to any Antitrust Concession, without Buyer's prior written consent. (g)
Buyer shall have the responsibility for, and shall pay, 50% of filing fees
associated with filings pursuant to the HSR Act and any other applicable
Antitrust Laws, and Seller shall have responsibility for, and shall pay, the
other 50% of such filing fees. (h) Within five (5) days after the date of this
Agreement, Seller shall, or Seller shall cause the Company to, deliver the
written notices required as a result of, or requests for consents in
connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under those
insurance company or carrier Contracts set forth on Schedule 6.3(h), which
notices and requests for consent shall be in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Buyer. Section 6.4 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Parties
will cooperate, and use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws for such Party to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof. The Parties agree, with respect to a
threatened or pending, preliminary or permanent Law or Order that would
adversely affect the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, to use their respective reasonable best efforts to
prevent or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as the case may
be. The Parties further agree to execute and deliver such documents and other
papers, as may be required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Section 6.5 Public Announcements. Except as otherwise agreed to by the other
Party, neither Party will issue any report, statement or press release or
otherwise make any public statements or filings with respect to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, (i)
each Party and its respective Affiliates may issue a report, statement or
press release or otherwise make a public statement or filing with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, filing this Agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission) as required, in such Party's reasonable discretion, by applicable
Law or the rules of any stock exchange, and (ii) Buyer or its Affiliates may
issue a report, statement or press release or otherwise make a public
statement or filing with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as required, in Buyer's reasonable discretion,
by any credit agreement, indenture or other debt instrument to which the Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, and in each case the disclosing Party
shall use its reasonable efforts to give the other Party advance opportunity
to review and comment on such release or announcement (and the disclosing
Party will consider in good faith the comments received from the other Party).
The Parties acknowledge and agree that without prior consultation with or
approval of Seller, Buyer may provide on a confidential basis general
information about the subject matter of this Agreement and the Company in
connection with Buyer and its Affiliates' fund raising, marketing,
informational or reporting activities. Section 6.6 Prior Knowledge. If Buyer
obtains actual knowledge on or prior to the Closing Date of the existence or
occurrence of any fact or event which has caused, or is reasonably expected to
45 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement050.jpg) 

cause, any inaccuracy or breach by Seller of any representation or warranty
contained in Article III or Article IV hereof that is reasonably likely to
cause the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.3(a), then Buyer
will as soon as practicable after obtaining such actual knowledge notify
Seller of such matter in writing. No failure by Buyer to inform Seller of such
fact or event as provided herein will constitute a waiver and release by Buyer
of any rights it may have hereunder to delay the Closing or terminate this
Agreement or otherwise as a result of such representation or warranty being
untrue or inaccurate because of such fact and Buyer shall have no obligation
to conduct any investigation. Section 6.7 Supplemental Disclosure. Seller
shall, from time to time prior to the Closing, by notice in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, supplement or amend any Schedule or add a
Schedule with a corresponding reference to be added to this Agreement (each, a
"Supplement"), including one or more Supplements to correct any material
matter that would have been required to be set forth or described in the
Schedules. Each Supplement shall be accompanied by reasonably detailed factual
supporting information relating to all matters disclosed therein. In the event
that any Supplement includes a certification from the Seller that the matters
disclosed in such Supplement are reasonably likely to cause the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) to be satisfied, then Buyer will be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) by delivery of
a written termination notice to Seller within five (5) Business Days after
delivery by Seller of such Supplement. If Buyer does not provide a written
termination notice pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8.1(d) within
five (5) Business Days after receiving any such Supplement referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence, then Buyer will be deemed to have waived for
all purposes of this Agreement all rights and remedies (including its right
not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement due to the
failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a)) hereunder or under
applicable Law arising out of the breach of any representations and warranties
of Seller disclosed in the applicable Supplement; provided, that if the time
period during which Buyer has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(d) would extend beyond the Closing Date, Buyer may, at any
time, by providing written notice thereof to Seller, extend the Closing Date
to the fifth (5 th ) Business Day that follows the last day on which such
right is permitted to be exercised. For the avoidance of doubt, if a
Supplement is delivered without a certification from Seller that the matters
disclosed in such Supplement are reasonably likely to cause the failure of the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) to be satisfied, then the Supplement
shall neither cure any breaches by the Seller of this Agreement nor affect the
rights and remedies of the Buyer set forth in this Agreement. Section 6.8 Tax
Matters. (a) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreement between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller), on the
other hand, will be terminated as of the Closing Date and will have no further
effect for any Taxable year (whether the current year, a future year, or a
past year). As of the Closing, the Company will not have any further
obligations to Seller or its Affiliates, or have any liability, under any such
Tax sharing agreement. (b) Responsibility for Filing Income Tax Returns for
Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date and Combined Tax Returns. Seller
will be responsible for preparing and filing, and remitting any Taxes due with
(except to the extent such Taxes were reflected as a Liability in the Final
Closing Statement), (i) all Income Tax Returns of the Company for all periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date and (ii) all Combined Tax Returns. (c)
Responsibility for Filing Other Tax Returns. Except for the Tax Returns
described in Section 6.8(b), Buyer will, at its own expense, prepare or cause
to be prepared and timely file or cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of
the Company that have not yet been filed and are required to be filed after
the Closing Date. Seller will remit to the Buyer any Taxes owed by the Company
with respect to any such Tax Returns for Taxable periods (or portions thereof)
ending on or before 46 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement051.jpg) 

the Closing Date no later than three days prior to the date such Tax Returns
are filed, except to the extent such Taxes were reflected as a Liability in
the Final Closing Statement. For purposes of this Section 6.8(c), in the case
of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a
Taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"), the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of
such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date will (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, receipts or
transactions, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle
Period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period and (ii) in the case of
any Tax based upon or related to income, receipts or transactions (including
income Taxes, withholding Taxes and sales and use Taxes), be deemed equal to
the amount which would be payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the
Closing Date; provided, that, exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and
amortization deductions) will be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period beginning after the Closing Date in proportion to
the number of days in each period to the extent permitted by applicable Law.
Any credits or estimated Tax payments relating to a Straddle Period will be
taken into account as though the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing
Date. (d) Finalization of Other Returns. With respect to any Tax Return
required to be filed after the Closing Date by Seller pursuant to Section
6.8(b)(i) or by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.8(c), in each case, for any
Taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date,
the preparing party will prepare the Tax Return in a manner consistent with
past practice, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. The preparing
Party will provide the other Party with copies of any such Income Tax Return
and other material Tax Return, along with all material schedules, statements,
workpapers and supporting documentation (the "Supporting Documentation")
promptly after the preparing Party has prepared such Tax Return and Supporting
Documentation. The non- preparing Party will have the right to review any such
Income Tax Return, other material Tax Return and Supporting Documentation;
provided, that the preparing Party will not be required to request an
extension of time for the filing of such Tax Return and the preparing Party
will have the right to file such Tax Return even if the non-preparing Party
has not completed its review of such Tax Return and Supporting Documentation
or objects to any such Tax Return. If the non-preparing Party disputes any
items shown on any such Income Tax Return or other material Tax Return, the
non-preparing Party will notify the preparing Party within 20 Business Days
after receiving such Tax Return and the Supporting Documentation. Buyer and
Seller will negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any disputed items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any
disputed items within 30 days after the receipt by the non-preparing Party of
the Tax Return filed or proposed to be filed, such dispute will be resolved by
the Independent Accountant, which will resolve any issue in dispute as
promptly as practicable. Upon resolution of any dispute by Buyer and Seller or
by the Independent Accountant's delivery of its determination to Buyer and
Seller, appropriate amendments will be made to the Tax Return and appropriate
adjustments will be made to the Tax amount previously paid by Seller to Buyer
in order to reflect the resolution by Buyer and Seller or the Independent
Accountant's determination, as the case may be. If such determination reflects
an overpayment by Seller, Buyer will promptly pay, or will cause the Company
to promptly pay to Seller an amount equal to such overpayment amount. The
determination by the Independent Accountant will be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant
will be shared equally by Buyer and Seller. (e) Certain Taxes. All Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller, except for Transfer
Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by Section
6.18, which will be borne solely by Seller. Seller will prepare and timely
file all Transfer Tax Returns and promptly provide a 47 US 167664346 HB:
4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement052.jpg) 

copy of such Tax Return to Buyer. Buyer and Seller will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate to timely prepare and file any
Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any
claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any
Transfer Taxes. (f) Refunds. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer or the
Company, and any amounts credited against Taxes to which Buyer or the Company
becomes entitled (including any interest paid or credited with respect
thereto), that relate to Tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before
the Closing Date will be for the account of Seller except to the extent such
refund was (i) included as a Current Asset in the calculation of Net Working
Capital, or (ii) attributable to any carryback of a loss or credit generated
in a Taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.
Buyer will pay over to Seller an amount equal to such refund or amount of any
such credit, net of any reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including Taxes)
incurred in connection with the receipt thereof, within 15 days after receipt
of such refund or claiming of such credit. Any such refunds or credits
relating to any Straddle Period will be equitably apportioned between Buyer
and Seller in accordance with Section 6.8(c). (g) Amendments to Returns.
Following the Closing, Buyer will not (i) file any amended Tax Return for the
Company for a Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing
Date, or (ii) make, change or revoke any Tax election or change any accounting
period or method of the Company with retroactive effect to any Tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date, in each case, except
(a) with the Seller's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or if such action could not result in a Tax liability to Seller or
form the basis for an indemnity claim against the Seller hereunder. (h) Tax
Cooperation. Buyer and Seller will cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns relating to the operations of the Company and any Action with respect
to Taxes. Cooperation includes (i) the retention and (on the other Party's
request and at such Party's expense) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to the filing of any Tax Returns and any Action
and (ii) making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided under this
Agreement. Each of Seller and Buyer agree (A) to retain all books and records
of the Company with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating
to any Taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any
extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable periods, and (B) to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall not
be required to provide Buyer any Combined Tax Returns or any Tax Returns or
related work papers of Seller or any of its Affiliates that are not being
transferred pursuant to this Agreement. (i) Tax Treatment. Buyer and Seller
agree that the purchase and sale of the Equity Interests shall, for U.S.
federal, state and local income tax purposes be treated as a purchase and sale
of the assets of the Company, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.
Buyer and Seller will (and will cause their respective Affiliates to) report
the U.S. federal, state, and local income and other Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent therewith.
(j) Benefit Advisors Network. (i) To the extent permissible under applicable
Law (including Section 706 of the Code) and the applicable governing documents
of Benefits Advisors Network, the 48 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement053.jpg) 

Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to ensure that all items of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of Benefit Advisors Network for the
taxable year in which the Closing occurs that are attributable to the
interests in such entity being transferred pursuant to this Agreement are
allocated between Seller and Buyer based on an interim closing of such
entity's books as of the Closing. (ii) At Buyer's request, Seller shall
reasonably cooperate in requesting the agreement of Benefit Advisors Network
to have in effect or make an election under Section 754 of the Code for the
taxable year that includes the Closing Date so as to adjust the basis of the
assets of such entity in accordance with Section 743(b) of the Code; provided
that such an election is permitted under the terms of the applicable governing
documents of Benefits Advisor Network. (k) Purchase Price Adjustment. Any
amounts paid pursuant to this Section 6.8 will be treated as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the extent permitted by applicable
Law. (l) Transaction Expense Deductions. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, all Company Transaction Expenses will be deducted on Tax Returns for Tax
periods, or portions thereof, that end on or prior to the Closing Date.
Section 6.9 Preservation of Records. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Buyer agrees that it will, and it will cause the Company to, (a)
preserve and keep the records (including all accounting records) of the
Company for a period of seven (7) years from the Closing, or for any longer
periods as may be required by Law, and (b) make such records available to
Seller as may be reasonably required by Seller in accordance with Section
6.2(d). This Section 6.9 shall not apply to Tax records, which are governed by
Section 6.8(h). Section 6.10 Employees; Employee Benefits. (a) Buyer agrees
that each employee of Seller listed on Schedule 6.10(a) who is not otherwise
identified as a "Consultant" on Schedule 3.18(a)(i) who accepts an offer of
employment from Buyer (the "Transferred Employees") will, for a period of one
year following the Closing Date, be provided with (i) employment at a location
within a reasonable commuting distance not to exceed 25 miles from the primary
location at which the employee worked immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
target total cash compensation opportunities (inclusive of base salary or
wages and cash bonus opportunities, as applicable) substantially equal to
those to which such Transferred Employees were entitled immediately prior to
the Closing Date and (iii) other benefits that are of substantially similar
benefit levels in the aggregate to the benefits provided by Buyer to its
employees generally (excluding the Transferred Employees) who are similarly
situated to such Transferred Employees (with the comparison of benefits under
this clause (iii) determined with reference to benefits other than annual
bonuses, deferred compensation arrangements and incentive and equity-based
compensation plans). Notwithstanding the above, Seller shall provide Buyer a
correct and complete list on the Closing Date of any employee described in
this subsection who is absent on the Closing Date due to coverage under a
short-term disability arrangement of the Seller or an Affiliate, and each such
employee shall become a "Transferred Employee" on the date such employee is
both (i) no longer covered under such short- term disability arrangement, and
(ii) willing and able to return to active employment status with Buyer;
provided, however, Buyer shall have no obligation to hire any such employee
who has transitioned to a long-term disability arrangement of the Seller or an
Affiliate as of or following the Closing Date. Seller may, from time to time
prior to or at the Closing, by notice in accordance with 49 US 167664346 HB:
4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement054.jpg) 

the terms of this Agreement and advance written consent by Buyer, supplement
or amend Schedule 6.10(a). (b) Commencing on the Closing Date, Buyer will, or
will cause the Company to continue to, employ each employee of the Company who
is not otherwise identified as a Consultant on Schedule 3.18(a)(i) (the
"Continuing Employees") (including each such employee who is absent due to
vacation, holiday, illness or leave of absence). Notwithstanding the above,
Seller shall provide Buyer a correct and complete list on the Closing Date of
any employee described in this subsection who is absent on the Closing Date
due to coverage under a short-term disability arrangement of the Seller or an
Affiliate, and each such employee shall become a "Continuing Employee" on the
date such employee is both (i) no longer covered under such short-term
disability arrangement, and (ii) willing and able to return to active
employment status with Buyer; provided, however, Buyer shall have no
obligation to hire any such employee who has transitioned to a long-term
disability arrangement of the Seller or an Affiliate as of or following the
Closing Date. Buyer agrees that each Continuing Employee will, for a period of
one year following the Closing Date, be provided with (i) target total cash
compensation opportunities (inclusive of base salary or wages and cash bonus
opportunities, as applicable) substantially equal to those to which such
Continuing Employees were entitled immediately prior to the Closing Date and
(ii) other benefits that are of substantially similar benefit levels in the
aggregate to the benefits provided by Buyer to its employees generally
(excluding the Continuing Employees) who are similarly situated to such
Continuing Employees (with the comparison of benefits under this clause (ii)
determined with reference to benefits other than annual bonuses, deferred
compensation arrangements and incentive and equity-based compensation plans).
(c) Buyer agrees to provide Consultants for one year following the Closing
Date with other benefits that are of substantially similar benefit levels in
the aggregate to the benefits provided by Buyer to its employees generally who
are similarly situated to such Consultants (with the comparison of benefits
determined with reference to benefits other than annual bonus, deferred
compensation arrangements and incentive and equity-based compensation plans).
(d) In connection with the employee communications and other actions
contemplated by Section 6.10(l), Buyer shall offer and communicate the
retention payments consistent with the parameters described on Exhibit 6.10(d)
to such Consultants, Transferred Employees and Continuing Employees as are
identified therein, which shall include each of the Specified Producers.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall make the offers described in the
preceding sentence to each of the Specified Producers within ten (10) calendar
days after the date hereof. (e) On the Closing Date, Seller or the Company, as
applicable, shall pay out to each Consultant an amount in cash equal to all
paid time off entitlements earned by such Consultant prior to the Closing
Date. (f) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall transfer
all assets and Liabilities associated with the SERP to Seller, if any, such
that, as of and following the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any its
Affiliates shall assume or be responsible for any obligations or Liabilities
under or with respect to the SERP. (g) To the extent permissible under the
terms of the applicable Buyer Benefit Plans (as hereinafter defined) and in
accordance with applicable Law, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to: (i) provide continuation coverage pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code and Section 601 of ERISA to Persons whose "qualifying event" occurs
following the Closing Date with respect to any Consultant, Transferred
Employee or Continuing Employee who primarily performed services for the
Company following the Closing Date and his or her "qualified beneficiaries,"
with 50 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement055.jpg) 

"qualifying event" and "qualified beneficiaries" defined under Section 4980B
of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA; (ii) to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, assume, honor and be solely responsible for paying, providing
or satisfying when due all vacation, sick pay and other paid time off for the
Transferred Employees and Continuing Employees accrued but unused as of the
Closing Date, on the terms and conditions applicable thereto that are in
effect immediately prior to the Closing Date; (iii) cause the benefit plans,
programs, practices, policies or arrangements maintained by Buyer following
the Closing Date and in which any of the Consultants, Transferred Employees
and Continuing Employees participate (the "Buyer Benefit Plans") to recognize
all costs and expenses incurred by the Consultants, Transferred Employees and
Continuing Employees (and their respective dependents and beneficiaries) up to
(and including) the Closing Date, for purposes of satisfying applicable
deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like
adjustments or limitations on coverage under any such Buyer Benefit Plan, and
to waive any preexisting condition, evidence of insurability, good health or
actively-at-work exclusions for the Consultants, Transferred Employees and
Continuing Employees; (iv) continue to provide paid time off for the remainder
of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs and for the succeeding year
under the vacation and holiday plan offered to Transferred Employees and
Continuing Employees as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, to the
extent more favorable than the vacation and holiday benefits provided under
the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan, in which any such employee may instead be
entitled to participate following the Closing Date; and (v) offer severance to
the Transferred Employees and Continuing Employees upon termination during the
one-year period starting on the Closing Date equal to the greater of (A) the
severance payments and benefits that would have been offered pursuant to
arrangements applicable to the Transferred Employees and Continuing Employees
that were in effect immediately before the Closing Date as set forth on
Exhibit 6.10(g) or (B) the severance payments and benefits offered pursuant to
the applicable Buyer Benefit Plan; provided that if any such Transferred
Employee or Continuing Employee either (1) has entered into an individual
employment agreement containing a contractual severance component with the
Company or Seller, as applicable, prior to the date hereof and does not enter
into the Buyer New Hire Documents (as hereinafter defined), or (2) enters into
any Buyer New Hire Documents containing a contractual severance component
containing greater severance payments and benefits than what would be provided
under clause (A) and (B) above, such Transferred Employee or Continuing
Employee shall instead be entitled to receive the contractual severance
payments and benefits offered pursuant to the applicable Contract. (h)
Effective after the Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates will use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting and accrual purposes under the Buyer
Benefit Plans, as permitted by the terms of each such Buyer Benefit Plan, for
the benefit of the Consultants, Transferred Employees and the Continuing
Employees, all previous service with Seller and its Affiliates, including the
Company, prior to the Closing Date to the extent such service was recognized
under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan or Associated Benefit Plan
covering such Consultants, Transferred Employees or Continuing Employees,
except where credit would result in duplication of benefits. (i) Following the
Closing and pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code, Buyer shall permit
its or an Affiliate's tax-qualified defined contribution plan to accept
rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the
meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) in cash in an amount equal to the
total value of the account balances distributed to the Consultants,
Transferred Employees and Continuing Employees from any Associated Benefit
Plan that is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (a "Seller 401(k)
Plan"). For purposes of this Section 6.10(i), the term "eligible rollover
distribution" shall include (i) the amount of any unpaid balance of loans made
to a Consultant, Transferred Employee or Continuing Employee, as applicable,
under a Seller 401(k) Plan and (ii) the promissory note evidencing such loans,
but shall expressly exclude 51 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement056.jpg) 

any portion of an account balance that is comprised of Equity Rights in
Seller. Seller and its Affiliates shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that any Seller 401(k) Plan allows the Consultants, Transferred Employees and
Continuing Employees to rollover distributions of their respective account
balances (in cash and in loan notes, if any, evidencing loans to such
employees as of the date of distribution). (j) Buyer and Seller agree to
utilize or cause their respective Affiliates to utilize, the standard
procedure set forth in Revenue Procedure 2004-53, 2004-2 C.B. 320, with
respect to wage reporting. (k) Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, neither Buyer nor any its Affiliates shall assume any obligations or
Liabilities under or with respect to, or receive any right or interest in any
trusts relating to, any assets of or any insurance, administration or other
contracts pertaining to, any of the Associated Benefit Plans. Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, all Consultants, Transferred Employees
and Continuing Employees will cease, effective as of the Closing Date, any
participation in and any benefit accrual under each of the Associated Benefit
Plans, except as required by applicable Law. The Consultants, Transferred
Employees and Continuing Employees shall continue participation under the
Associated Benefit Plans which provide health, disability, severance, life
insurance or similar benefits with respect to claims incurred by such
employees and their eligible spouses, dependents or qualified beneficiaries,
as applicable, on or prior to the Closing Date. (l) Buyer shall from the date
hereof to the Closing Date, upon reasonable advance notice to Seller, be
allowed to meet with Consultants and any other employee of Seller or the
Company who becomes a Transferred Employee or Continuing Employee, as
applicable, for the purpose of coming to terms of continued employment. The
Company shall permit Buyer reasonable access to such Consultants, Transferred
Employees and Continuing Employees to enable Buyer to present and discuss
terms of employment, including requesting that each employee sign Buyer's new
hire documents for similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates
(the "Buyer New Hire Documents"). Buyer shall not distribute templates of any
Buyer New Hire Documents to any Consultants, Transferred Employees and/or
Continuing Employees without Seller's prior consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall provide
reasonable advance notice to Seller of, and Seller shall have the right to
attend, any in-person, on-site meeting, and any phone calls or online
presentations, in each case between Buyer and any group of Consultants,
Transferred Employees and/or Continuing Employees. Seller agrees, on behalf of
itself and the Company, to facilitate any communications with any such
employees as reasonably requested by Buyer, subject to Seller's prior review,
comment and consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) with respect to any broad-based communications. (m) To
the extent that any current or former Consultant or other employee of the
Covered Business has agreed to be bound by any employment agreement, offer
letter, confirmation letter, equity or equity-based award agreement,
confidentiality agreement, or severance or separation agreement with Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Company), in each case with restrictive
covenants binding upon such Consultant or employee, (i) Seller agrees, at
Buyer's request, to cause Seller and its Affiliates to assign the rights
intended to be rights of the Company, including rights with respect to
restrictive covenants, and the obligations intended to be obligations of the
Company (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding obligations under any
Associated Benefit Plan, such as equity or equity-based incentive plans),
under the applicable documents to the Company within a reasonable time period
following such request, and/or (ii) Seller agrees, at Buyer's request and
expense, to seek to enforce the terms of such restrictive covenants in an
appropriate forum, whether through injunctive relief or other form of
available remedy. 52 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement057.jpg) 

(n) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, if and to the extent that
the Company is not already in possession and control of the personnel files
for any Consultant or other employee of Seller or the Company who becomes a
Transferred Employee or Continuing Employee, respectively, or any former
employee of the Company who was employed by the Covered Business on or after
October 1, 2018, prior to the Closing Seller shall cause such personnel files
to be transferred to the Company. With respect to any former employee of the
Covered Business whose employment with the Covered Business terminated before
October 1, 2018, solely to the extent that Seller or any of its Affiliates
have possession of the applicable files and records, Seller shall transfer
such individual's personnel files to the Company promptly if and when the
Company notifies Seller in writing that such records are relevant to any
Action or audit. (o) Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Buyer to
continue to employ any particular Consultant, Transferred Employee or
Continuing Employee following the Closing Date for any particular period of
time, (ii) shall be construed to prohibit Buyer from amending or terminating
any Buyer Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit program, plan, policy or
arrangement, (iii) shall constitute or be construed as an amendment of any
Buyer Benefit Plan or any other employee benefit program, plan, policy or
arrangement or (iv) shall create or be intended to create any third- party
beneficiary rights. Section 6.11 Use of Names and Trademarks. The Parties
acknowledge that Seller and its Affiliates are retaining all rights with
respect to the Seller Marks. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Closing Date, but in any event within 90 days after the Closing Date, Seller
will, at its own expense and in cooperation and coordination with the Company,
remove any and all exterior signs and other identifiers located on or attached
to the Company's property, building, vehicles, signs or premises that refer or
pertain to or that include the Seller Marks. Additionally, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but in any event within 90 days
after the Closing Date, Buyer will remove from all of the Company's
letterhead, envelopes, invoices, supplies, labels, product packaging and
inserts, web sites, web site publications, promotional materials, marketing
collateral, advertisements and other communications media of any kind, all
references to the Seller Marks. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it will
have no right to use any of the Seller Marks or any derivative thereof after
the conclusion of the 90-day period immediately following the Closing Date.
Seller, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby grants to the Company a
nonexclusive, fully-paid, royalty-free license to reproduce, display and
otherwise use the Seller Marks solely (a) to the extent necessary to allow the
Company to operate the Covered Business during such 90- day period and in a
manner consistent with this Section 6.11, and (b) to the extent necessary to
allow the Company to comply with the terms of any Contract relating to the
Covered Business in effect as of Closing during the term thereof (excluding
any renewal term). Section 6.12 Non-Solicitation. (a) For three (3) years
after the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, service or accept any Active Client
or Prospective Client (as defined below) for the purpose of providing products
or services that are substantially similar to, within or competitive with the
Covered Business; or (ii) request, induce or advise any Active Client or
Prospective Client, or any Person who currently has, or has had, material
business relationships with the Company or, solely with respect to
relationships related to the Covered Business, Seller, during the two (2) year
period preceding the Closing Date, to withdraw, curtail or cancel any of their
business or relations with the Company or such business or relations with
Seller. 53 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement058.jpg) 

As used herein, the term "Active Client" shall mean any customer or client of
the Company or Seller who purchased any products or services from the Company
or Seller pertaining to the Covered Business within the two (2) year period
preceding the Closing Date. "Prospective Client" means any Person, or a group
of Persons, (x) who or which had been identified with reasonable particularity
by the Company or Seller (or any of their respective representatives) in the
business records of the Company or Seller within the two (2) year period
preceding the Closing Date, as a possible client or customer of the Covered
Business, (y) to whom a representative of the Company or Seller (with respect
to the Covered Business) had communicated within the two (2) year period
preceding the Closing Date in writing (including by e-mail) with respect to
the provision of any services of the Covered Business. (b) Subject to Section
6.12(c), Seller agrees that, for three (3) years after the Closing Date,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, engage, directly or
indirectly in, or own an interest in, or manage, operate or control any Person
engaged in, any business that is similar to, within or competitive with, the
Covered Business (a "Competing Business"), in each case in Illinois, Wisconsin
or Minnesota. (c) Nothing contained in Section 6.12(b) shall be construed to
prohibit Seller and its Affiliates from: (i) acquiring or holding all or any
portion of the assets or equity interests of any Person engaged in a Competing
Business; provided, that if the Competing Business accounts for more than 10%
of the revenues of such assets or such Person (based on the latest relevant
annual financial statements), Seller will, or, if applicable, will cause its
Affiliates to (A) limit such Covered Business or (B) divest a portion of the
assets that constitute such Competing Business, in each case, within 12 months
after the consummation of the acquisition such that following such limitation
or divestment, the applicable Competing Business accounts for less than 10% of
the revenues of such assets or such Person (based on the latest relevant
financial statements); provided that, following such acquisition, the acquired
business engages in the Competing Business (1) only in compliance with Section
6.12(a) and (2) only under a name that is not confusingly similar to the name
"Associated Benefits and Risk Consulting"; (ii) acquiring, holding of
investments or owning, directly or indirectly, any voting stock, capital stock
or other voting equity interest of any Person engaged in a Competing Business,
so long as such ownership interest represents not more than (A) 3% of the
aggregate voting power of such Person if such Person is listed on any national
securities exchange or national quotation system or (B) 5% of any private
equity fund or alternative investment vehicle in which Seller or its
Affiliates is a passive investor; provided, however, that in the case of (A)
or (B) Seller and its Affiliates do not directly or indirectly participate in
any way in the operation or management of the Competing Business; or (iii)
continuing to engage in any business other than the Covered Business. (d)
Seller agrees that, for three (3) years after the Closing Date, Seller and
Affiliates shall not solicit for employment or hire any current or former
Consultant or any Transferred Employee or Continuing Employee; provided that
this Section 6.12(d) shall not prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from (i)
conducting a general solicitation or advertisement that is not specifically
directed at any of such individuals or groups of individuals, (ii) soliciting
for employment or hiring any Transferred Employees or Continuing Employees who
have not been employed or engaged by the 54 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement059.jpg) 

Company or Seller for a period of six months prior to the date such
individuals were first solicited for employment or (iii) soliciting for
employment or hiring any Consultants, Transferred Employees or Continuing
Employees whose employment or engagement with the Company is terminated by the
Company. (e) Seller and its Affiliates shall treat and hold as confidential
(i) any and all confidential or proprietary information, knowledge and data to
the extent relating to the Company and/or the Covered Business and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination
or disclosure of such confidential or proprietary information, knowledge and
data, and (ii) all confidential or proprietary information relating to the
business of Buyer and its Affiliates that becomes known to Seller or its
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements, and not otherwise use such confidential or
proprietary information (the confidential or proprietary information,
knowledge and data set forth in clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "Buyer
Confidential Information"), in each of clauses (i) and (ii), unless Buyer
provides its prior written consent to such use or disclosure; provided, that
Seller shall be permitted to disclose Buyer Confidential Information (A) to
its respective representatives to whom such disclosure is necessary in the
conduct of the business of Seller if such Persons are informed by Seller of
the confidential nature of such Buyer Confidential Information and are
directed by Seller to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.12(e) and
(B) subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.12(e), as may be required
by applicable Law. Seller shall be liable to Buyer for any breach by its
Affiliates and representatives of this Section 6.12(e). The term "Buyer
Confidential Information" shall not include any information that (1) at the
time of disclosure is publicly available through no act or omission of Seller,
(2) becomes available on a non-confidential basis from a third party source,
so long as such source is not known by Seller to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to Buyer, or (3) is developed
independently by Seller without the use of Buyer Confidential Information, as
evidenced by the internal records of Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Seller or its Affiliates or their respective representatives becomes legally
compelled by Order or is required by the rules and regulations or any action
of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to disclose any such
Buyer Confidential Information, Seller shall, and shall direct its applicable
Affiliates or representatives, (x) to the extent reasonably practicable and
permitted by applicable Law, provide Buyer with reasonable prior written
notice of such requirement so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other
remedy (at Buyer's expense), (y) if such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, furnish only that portion of such Buyer Confidential Information
that is legally required to be provided and exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such Buyer Confidential Information, and (z) use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly furnish to Buyer a copy (in whatever form or
medium) of such Buyer Confidential Information it intends to furnish or has
furnished. (f) The undertakings in Section 6.12(a) through Section 6.12(e) are
given to Buyer and to each of its Affiliates. Seller acknowledges that such
undertakings are entirely independent restrictions and are no greater than is
reasonably necessary to protect the interests of Buyer and its Affiliates. If
the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term
or provision of Section 6.12(a), Section 6.12(b), Section 6.12(c), Section
6.12(d) or Section 6.12(e) is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that
such court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will
have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of the term or provision,
to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so modified after
the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed. 55 US
167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2

Section 6.13 Guarantees; Commitments; Misdirected Payments. (a) After the
Closing, Buyer and the Company, jointly and severally, will forever indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and any of its Affiliates against any
Liabilities, that Seller or any of its Affiliates suffers, incurs or is liable
for by reason of or arising out of or in consequence of: (i) Seller or any of
its Affiliates issuing, making required payment under, being required to pay
or reimburse the issuer of, or being a party to, any guarantee, indemnity,
surety bond, letter of credit, letter of comfort or other similar credit
support obligation in the nature of a financial obligation to the extent
relating to the Covered Business (collectively, the "Indemnified Guarantees");
(ii) any claim or demand for payment made on Seller or any of its Affiliates
with respect to any of the Indemnified Guarantees; or (iii) any Action by any
Person who is or claims to be entitled to the benefit of or claims to be
entitled to payment, reimbursement or indemnity with respect to any
Indemnified Guarantees. (b) Buyer will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause Seller and its Affiliates to be released, effective as of the Closing,
in respect of all obligations of Seller and any of its Affiliates under each
of the guarantees, leases, indemnities, letters of credit, surety bonds,
letters of comfort, commitments, understandings, Contracts and other similar
credit support obligations in the nature of a financial obligation of such
Persons related to the Covered Business that would constitute Indemnified
Guarantees if such obligations remain in effect at Closing through the
delivery of replacement letters of credit or other credit support in favor of
third party creditors who are beneficiaries of such obligations, or by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates agreeing to provide replacement guarantees, in each
case as shall be determined by Buyer or the Company with each such third party
creditor. To the extent Seller and its Affiliates are not so released
effective as of the Closing, Buyer will continue to use its reasonable best
efforts and will cause the Company to use its reasonable best efforts to
effect such release after the Closing. (c) Following the Closing, Seller and
Buyer covenant and agree to promptly remit to the other Party (or Affiliate
thereof) any payments received that are owed to the other Party (or Affiliate
thereof). From and after the Closing, Seller will (and will cause its
Affiliates to) forward promptly to Company any monies, checks or instruments
received by Seller or any of its Affiliates after the Closing to the extent
constituting any assets of the Company or the Covered Business. From and after
the Closing, Buyer will (and will cause Company to) forward promptly to Seller
any monies, checks or instruments received by Company after the Closing to the
extent constituting any assets of the Seller or any of its Affiliates. Section
6.14 Termination of Intercompany Arrangements; Intercompany Balances. Except
for the Ancillary Agreements or as set forth on Schedule 6.14, each Contract
and other arrangement between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any
of its Affiliates, on the other hand, will be terminated prior to or as of the
Closing, without further liability or obligation (contingent or otherwise) of
any party thereunder. At or prior to Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with
reasonably satisfactory evidence of the termination of all agreements required
to be terminated pursuant to the preceding sentence. Prior to the Valuation
Time, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, settle all intercompany
balances between the Company, on the one hand, and the Seller or any Affiliate
of the Seller, on the other hand. Section 6.15 Contact with Customers,
Suppliers and Other Business Relations. During the period from the date of
this Agreement until the earliest of the Closing Date or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer hereby agrees that it is
not authorized to and will not (and will not permit any of its employees,
agents, representatives or Affiliates to) contact any employee (excluding
executive officers and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.10(l)),
customer, supplier or other material business relation of the Company or the
Covered Business regarding the Company, the 56 US 167664346 HB:

the prior written consent of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section

businesses where such activities do not relate to the Company, this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 6.16 Release and Directors'
and Officers' Indemnification. (a) Effective as of the Closing, Buyer on
behalf of itself and its past, present or future successors, assigns,

Section 6.17 Insurance. (a) With respect to each Company Insurance Policy held
by the Company that is a "claims made" policy, Seller will, and will cause the
Company to, cooperate with Buyer at its request (and at its expense) in
securing the extension of the reporting terms for each such Company Insurance
Policy to a date at least three years subsequent to the Closing Date or in
taking whatever actions Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the
purchase of a "tail" policy, which policy premiums shall be paid by Buyer,
providing for continued coverage of the Company and the Covered Business for a
period extending at least three years following the Closing Date, with respect
to all liabilities accruing with respect to the Company or the Covered
Business prior to the Closing Date. (b) From and after the Closing Date,
except with respect to any Company Insurance Policy held by the Company, the
Company Insurance Policies may be terminated or modified by the Seller or any
of its Affiliates (including by allowing a Company Insurance Policy to expire)
to exclude coverage of the Company or the Covered Business and the assets,
liabilities, employees or operations of the Company or the Covered Business
with respect to all liabilities accruing solely during the time period on and
after the Closing Date, except that in all cases with respect to each such
Insurance Policy that is a "claims made" policy, either, at Buyer's request
(and at its expense with respect to the portion of the premium that is
attributable to the Covered Business) (i) the reporting terms for each such
Insurance Policy must have been extended to a date at least three years
subsequent to the Closing Date, or (ii) Seller and/or an Affiliate must have
taken whatever steps the Buyer may reasonably have requested prior to such
termination, modification or expiration to allow Buyer to obtain a "tail"
policy providing for continued coverage of the Company and the Covered
Business for a period extending at least three years following the Closing
Date with respect to all liabilities accruing with respect to the Company or
the Covered Business prior to the Closing Date. (c) With respect to each
Company Insurance Policy that is held by a Person other than the Company: (i)
the Company will be solely responsible for notifying any and all insurance
companies of any claims by or on behalf of the Company or the Covered
Business, and complying with all policy terms and conditions for pursuit and
collection of such claims and the Company will not, without the written
consent of Seller or one or more of its Affiliates, or such other Person that
holds such Company Insurance Policy, as applicable, amend, modify or waive any
rights of Seller, one or more of its Affiliates, or other insureds under any
such Company Insurance Policies. The Company will exclusively bear and be
liable (and Seller and its Affiliates will have no obligation to repay or
reimburse the Company) for all uninsured, uncovered, unavailable or
uncollectible amounts relating to or associated with all such claims
(including any deductible, self-insured retention and similar concepts); and
(ii) with respect to coverage claims or requests for benefits asserted by the
Company under the Company Insurance Policies, Seller and its Affiliates, or
such other Person that holds such Company Insurance Policy, as applicable,
will have the right but not the duty to monitor or associate with such claims
at the sole expense of Seller or any of its Affiliates, or such other Person
that holds such Company Insurance Policy, as applicable. The Company will be
liable for any fees, costs or expenses awarded on or after the Closing Date
against Seller and its Affiliates for the benefit, directly or indirectly, of
the insurers or reinsurers of such Company Insurance Policies relating to any
unsuccessful coverage claims asserted solely by the Company. The Company will

Company, and otherwise with the consent of Seller, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (d) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, except with respect to any Company
Insurance Policy held by the Company, or any Company self-insurance policy or
program, nothing in this Agreement will limit, waive or abrogate in any manner
any rights of Seller or its Affiliates to insurance coverage for the Seller or
its Affiliates under any Company Insurance Policy for any matter, whether
relating to the Company, the Covered Business or otherwise. (e) For the
avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything in the contrary contained in
this Agreement, on and subsequent to the Closing Date, the Company shall have
the exclusive right to control, cancel, modify, terminate, renew or extend any
Company Insurance Policy held by the Company or any Company self-insurance
policy or program. (f) To the extent that any claim is made against the
Company or the Covered Business arising out of any act, omission, occurrence,
fact or circumstance existing or occurring prior to the Closing Date and any
Company Insurance Policy (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding (i) any
Company Insurance Policy held by the Company or (ii) any self-insurance policy
or program) by its terms covers such claim (any such claim, an "Insurance
Claim"), upon the Company's written request to Seller and at the sole cost and
expense of the Company, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in
making such Insurance Claim unless Seller reasonably believes that such
Insurance Claim is frivolous and utterly devoid of merit. In the event that
(i) Seller receives any proceeds of the coverage afforded by the Company
Insurance Policy with respect to any Insurance Claim and (ii) the amount of
such Insurance Claim has been paid by the Company, Seller shall promptly pay
such proceeds (net of any actual out-of-pocket costs or expenses paid by
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with such Insurance Claim) to
the Company to the extent of the amount so paid by the Company. The Company
hereby acknowledges and agrees that (A) any Insurance Claims shall be subject
to (and recovery thereon shall be reduced by the amount of) any applicable
deductibles, retentions or co-insurance provisions, (B) any out-of-pocket
costs incurred to pursue Insurance Claims shall be borne solely by the
Company, (C) the Insurance Claims shall be subject to exhaustion of existing
sublimits and aggregate limits, (D) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates
shall have any obligation to pay any additional premiums or other amounts due
to any insurer under any Company Insurance Policy in connection with any
Insurance Claims and (E) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be
liable or otherwise responsible for the failure of any insurer or other
provider of insurance to pay any Insurance Claim for any reason, except that
in the event of any such failure to pay an Insurance Claim, Seller and its
Affiliates shall cooperate with any reasonable request by the Company for
assistance in pursuing the payment of such Insurance Claim. (g) With respect
to all open, closed, new and re-opened claims covered under Seller and its
Affiliates' workers' compensation and employers' liability Insurance Policies
or comparable workers' compensation self-insurance programs relating to
employees of the Company or the Covered Business arising from occurrences
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will, or will cause the Company to, promptly
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for all claim payments, costs and expenses
relating to such claims, as well as any catastrophic coverage charges,
overhead, claim handling and administrative costs, Taxes, surcharges, state
assessments and other related costs, in each case irrespective of whether such
claims are made by the Company, Transferred Employees, Continuing Employees,
or by third parties with respect to the conduct and operation of the Company
or the Covered Business, and in each case limited to actual out-of-pocket
costs or charges paid by Seller or any of its Affiliates. Any payments, costs
and adjustments required to be made pursuant to this 59 US 167664346 HB:
4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement064.jpg) 

Section 6.17 or any other provisions of this Section 6.17 will be billed
quarterly and payable within 30 days from receipt of invoice. (h) No payments
due under this this Section 6.17 will affect, be affected by, or be subject to
set off against any adjustment to the Purchase Price. Whenever this Section
6.17 requires the Company to take any action after the Closing, such
requirement will be deemed to constitute an undertaking on the part of Buyer
to take such action or to cause the Company to take such action. Section 6.18
Distributions and Transfers Prior to Closing. (a) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, the Company shall be permitted to distribute
its Cash to Seller prior to the Closing; provided that such distribution does
not result in the Company having a negative amount of Cash. (b) Seller shall
take, and cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to effect the following transactions at or before the Valuation
Time: (i) the Owned Real Property shall be transferred, assigned or
distributed by the Company to Seller or its designee pursuant to a quitclaim
deed in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; (ii) all other
Excluded Assets shall be transferred, assigned or distributed by the Company
to Seller or its designee pursuant to assignment and transfer documents in all
cases in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, which documents
shall provide for no ongoing payments or continuing Liabilities of the Company
that are not fully satisfied and discharged as of immediately prior to the
Valuation Time; and (iii) all right, title and interest of Seller and any of
its Affiliates in any assets comprising part of the Covered Business listed on
Schedule 6.18(b), shall be contributed assigned and transferred to the
Company, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), pursuant to
contribution, assignment and transfer documents in all cases in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, which documents shall provide for
no ongoing payments or continuing Liabilities of the Company that are not
fully satisfied and discharged as of immediately prior to the Valuation Time.
(c) (i) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to mutually agree upon, establish and
implement, such arrangements and transactions as shall be reasonably necessary
to effectuate the transfer of both the Retirement Plan Consulting Business and
the Advanced Planning Business conducted through the LPL Networking Contract
to Buyer (or its designee) on the basis described in such transfer structure
option as shall be elected from time to time prior to Closing by Buyer for
each such business among the transfer structure options set forth on Exhibit
6.18(c) (each, a "Transfer Structure Option"). All such arrangements shall be
established and implemented by the Parties (A) in good faith and acting
reasonably, (B) in a manner designed to provide Buyer with the economic and
other benefits of ownership of the Retirement Plan Consulting Business and
Advanced Planning Business conducted through the LPL Networking Contract from
and after Closing, (C) in a manner compliant with applicable Laws, and (D) in
a manner that does not create any material Liability to Seller (excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, any liabilities arising from the gross negligence,
fraud or willful misconduct of Seller or its representatives). For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of any Transfer Structure Option shall
not be a condition to Closing. 60 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement065.jpg) 

(ii) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of its initial Transfer Structure
Option election within five (5) Business Days after the date hereof. If, in
Buyer's sole discretion, the continued pursuit by the Parties of the Transfer
Structure Option then being pursued under this Section 6.18(c) has becomes
impractical or Buyer determines that such option will not provide it with the
economic and other benefits of ownership of the Retirement Plan Consulting
Business or the Advanced Planning Business conducted through the LPL
Networking Contract from and after the Closing in an effective manner, it may
at any time thereafter (and prior to Closing) notify Seller in writing of its
election of another Transfer Structure Option with respect to the applicable
business. (iii) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller's reasonable best efforts
to pursue a Transfer Structure Option as provided in this Section 6.18(c) will
include the obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
agreement, cooperation and/or consent of LPL Financial LLC as may be necessary
or desirable to implement the applicable option and to facilitate such calls,
meetings and other communications between Buyer and LPL Financial LLC as Buyer
may reasonably request. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer shall be permitted to
directly contact and communicate with LPL Financial LLC in furtherance of this
Section 6.18(c) in its discretion. (iv) In connection with the transfer from
LPL Financial LLC to Buyer (or its designee) of client account registrations
as part of the implementation of any Transfer Structure Option, as between
Buyer and Seller, Buyer shall have the sole right to select whether client
consent for such transfer will be solicitated through an affirmative or
customary "negative consent" procedure. Section 6.19 Exclusivity. Seller
agrees that it will not and will cause its Affiliates and representatives not
to, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, entertain, initiate or encourage any
inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person relating to any acquisition of
any Equity Rights in the Company, or acquisition, license or other transfer of
all or any significant portion of the Covered Business or the assets or
business of the Company, or any divestiture, merger, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, redemption or similar
transaction involving the Company, or (b) with respect to any effort or
attempt by any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing, (i)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with such other Person, (ii)
furnish to any other Person any information with respect to the Company or the
Covered Business in connection with any such effort or (iii) otherwise
cooperate in any way with, or assist or participate in, or facilitate or
encourage any such effort, in any such case described in clause (a) or (b),
other than with Buyer and its controlled, its Affiliates. If any Person makes
any such effort described in clause (b) of the immediately preceding sentence,
Seller will promptly thereafter notify Buyer thereof and provide Buyer with
the terms or content of such effort and the identity of the applicable Person.
Section 6.20 Interim Financial Statements. Within thirty days following the
end of each calendar month prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver to
Buyer the unaudited balance sheet of the Covered Business as of the last day
of each month and the related statements of profit and loss, and cash flows
for the month and fiscal year-to-date period then ended. Such monthly
financial statements shall fairly present, in all material respects, in
conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (subject to the absence of
footnote disclosures), the financial position of the Covered Business as of
the dates thereof and its results of operations for the periods then ended.

Consultant termination within three (3) days following the date of
termination, (b) consult with Buyer regarding enforcement of any ABRC

Company and/or Seller with restrictive covenants binding upon the Consultant,
as applicable) with any Consultant who is terminated by, or resigns employment
with, the Company or Seller prior to Closing and take all steps reasonably
requested by Buyer, at Buyer's expense, including asserting a claim or Action
against a Consultant and (c) not waive, release or compromise any rights of
the Company or Seller to prohibit the violation of any such restrictive
covenant under the ABRC Noncompetition and Confidentiality Agreement (or any
other agreement with the Company and/or Seller with restrictive covenants
binding upon the Consultant, as applicable) with any Consultant whose
employment with the Company or Seller has terminated. Section 6.22 Financing
Cooperation. (a) In the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date or
earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide, and cause the Company and it and their respective
representatives to use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide,
subject to Section 6.2, at Buyer's sole expense, to Buyer such cooperation as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer that is customary in connection with any
effort by Buyer to obtain debt or other financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Buyer Financing"), including (i)
furnishing Buyer and its actual and potential financing sources with financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company and the Covered Business
as required by the definitive documents governing the Buyer Financing, (ii)
participation in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions, due
diligence presentations, ratings agency sessions and road shows in connection

offering documents, private placement memoranda, confidential and customary
bank information memoranda and similar documents used in connection with such
Buyer Financing, (iv) executing and delivering, as of the Closing Date, any

certificates or documents, in each case as applicable and to the extent
reasonably requested by the Buyer; provided that the effectiveness thereof
shall be conditioned upon, or become operative after, the occurrence of the
Closing, and (v) as of the Closing Date, taking all corporate actions
necessary to satisfy the conditions to consummation of the Buyer Financing and
to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available to Buyer. Notwithstanding
the above, all organizational actions shall be deemed to become effective only
if and when the Closing occurs and shall be derived exclusively from the
authority of, and shall only be taken by, the board of directors or other
equivalent governing body of the Company as constituted after giving effect to
the Closing. All non-public information or other confidential information
provided pursuant to this Section 6.22(a), shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be permitted to disclose such information to potential
syndicate members during syndication (and allow such potential syndicate
members to use such information in connection with such syndication), subject
to customary confidentiality undertakings by such potential syndicate members.
(b) Until the Closing, the Company shall not be required to pay any commitment
or other similar fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection
with the Buyer Financing, and for the avoidance of doubt, such fees shall not
constitute Company Transaction Expenses. Buyer shall, upon the earlier to
occur of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, reimburse Seller
and the Company for all reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by them in connection with the
cooperation of the Company with the Buyer Financing and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and the Company and their respective directors, officers,

any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Buyer Financing and any
information used in connection therewith (other than to the extent such Losses
arise from the willful breach, bad faith or gross negligence of Seller or the
Company). The foregoing indemnification obligation shall survive the Closing
and any termination of this Agreement. (c) Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 6.22 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Buyer Financing is not a
condition to the Closing. Section 6.23 Cooperation. For a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date (or for any longer period as may be required by
any Governmental Entity or established by any applicable statute of
limitations), to comply with the terms of this Agreement, any applicable Law

contractors or other 67 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement072.jpg) 

personnel as an employee of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including without
limitation the Company) as a result of the continued operation of the
Retirement Plan Consulting Business and/or Advanced Planning Business (as
applicable) under the LPL Networking Contract following the Closing as part
of, and prior to the consummation of, any Transfer Structure Option, or any
other claims asserted by any of Seller's or its Affiliates' personnel arising
out of such personnel's engagement with Seller or its Affiliates relating to
the continued operation of the Retirement Plan Consulting Business and/or
Advanced Planning Business (as applicable) under the LPL Networking Contract
following the Closing as part of, and prior to the consummation of, any
Transfer Structure Option, other than as a result of the gross negligence,
fraud, or willful misconduct of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or
representatives; or (xii) the Seller Bonus Arrangements. (b) Subject to the
other terms and conditions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing the
Buyer shall indemnify and defend the Seller and its Affiliates and each of
their respective officers, managers, directors, employees, equityholders,
agents and Representatives (the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against, and
shall hold the Seller Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, and shall
pay and reimburse the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any and all Losses
actually incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, the Seller Indemnified
Parties based upon or arising out of: (i) any failure of any of the
representations and warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement to be true
and correct as of the date hereof or as of the Closing Date; (ii) any breach
of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement; (iii) any selection or decision made by Buyer pursuant to Section
6.18(c)(iv) to solicit client consent through a "negative consent" procedure
or any action taken by Seller or its Affiliates at the direction of Buyer in
connection with such a "negative consent" procedure, in each case, whether
before or after Closing; and (iv) the continued operation of the Retirement
Plan Consulting Business and/or the Advanced Planning Business (as applicable)
by Seller and its Affiliates under the LPL Networking Contract following the
Closing as part of, and prior to the consummation of, any Transfer Structure
Option, except to the extent arising from the gross negligence, fraud or
willful misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates or representatives in
connection therewith. Section 9.3 Procedures. (a) Generally. The party making
a claim under this Article IX is referred to as the "Indemnified Party", and
the party against whom such claims are asserted under Article IX is referred
to as the "Indemnifying Party". (b) Third Party Claims. If any Indemnified
Party receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any Action made or
brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of
a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a "Third Party
Claim") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying 68 US 167664346 HB:
4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement073.jpg) 

Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of such Third Party Claim.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Action.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail, shall include copies of available material written evidence
thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after receiving notice
of such Third Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the
Indemnifying Party's own counsel, to assume the defense of any Third Party
Claim for so long as the Indemnifying Party prosecutes and vigorously defends
the Third Party Claim, and (i) such Third Party Claim is not a criminal Action
made by or on behalf of any Governmental Entity and does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have
agreed in writing for the benefit of the Indemnified Party that the
indemnification provisions of Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.2(b) (as
applicable), cover such Third Party Claim, (iii) there are no actual or
potential conflicts of interest between the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying
Party such that representation by the same counsel or control by the
Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate, (iv) if the Indemnifying Party is
Seller, the Third Party Claim is not a claim adverse to any insurance company
or carrier who has a material business relationship with Buyer or its
Affiliates, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such
defense and (v) such claim does not involve the determination by the Company
whether to exercise its rights under Section 7.4 of the Applicable Employment
Agreement, which determination and right to exercise shall remain in the
Company's sole discretion; provided, however, that in the case of any Third-
Party Claim relating to any Tax where the Seller is the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnifying Party shall only be entitled to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim if it relates solely to a Taxable period ending on or before
the Closing Date. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense
of any Third Party Claim, subject to Section 9.3(c), it shall have the right
to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, or appeal
any such Third Party Claim, and make defensive counterclaims that would negate
the existence or magnitude of such Third Party Claim (and excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any other counterclaims that might be available to the
Indemnified Party, including those relating to the same facts and
circumstances that do not negate the existence or magnitude of the Third Party
Claim), in each case in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Party's right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided that
the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
the Indemnified Party's counsel for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed such defense or after the Indemnifying Party fails to
diligently defend such Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, unless
and until the Indemnifying Party has validly elected to defend a Third Party
Claim as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
Section 9.3(c) pay, compromise and defend such Third Party Claim. Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection
with the defense of any Third Party Claim, including making available records
relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense (other than
reimbursement of actual out- of-pocket expenses) to the defending party,
management employees of the non-defending party as may be reasonably necessary
for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim. (c) Settlement
of Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, except as
provided in this Section 9.3(c). If the Indemnifying Party shall have validly
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim as provided in Section 9.3(b) and
be diligently prosecuting such defense, and a firm offer is made to settle a
Third 69 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement074.jpg) 

Party Claim which does not (i) impose injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) relate to
anything other than monetary damages that will be paid by the Indemnifying
Party in full, (iii) relate to any Tax, and (iv) contain any admission of
liability, or violation of the rights of any Person on the part of the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or representatives and provides, in
customary form, for the express, unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the maximum
liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer. The Indemnified Party shall not
agree to any settlement of any Third Party Claim in respect of which it has or
intends to seek indemnification under this Article IX without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). (d) Direct Claims. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on
account of a Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct
Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event not later
than 30 days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of such Direct Claim.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by reason of
such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of available material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall
allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Company's
premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request in each case subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 6.2(d). If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within
such 30 day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted
such claim. (e) Payment Protocol. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying
Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Section 9.3, the
Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within ten (10) Business Days
of such agreement or final, non-appealable adjudication by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. (f) Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments.
All indemnification payments made under this Section 9.3 shall be treated by
the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law. Section 9.4 Damages; Limitations. (a) In no event
will a Party be liable to another Party for (i) any speculative or remote
damages that would not otherwise be recoverable for breach of a contract under
Law or (ii) punitive or exemplary damages, except to the extent actually
required to be paid in relation to a Third Party Claim or in respect of
Seller's obligations under Section 6.12. 70 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement075.jpg) 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall
not have any liability for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(i) (excluding
Seller Fundamental Representation and Warranties) unless the aggregate of all
Losses under such Section exceed One Half of One Percent (0.5%) of the Final
Adjusted Base Purchase Price (the "Deductible") and then only for Losses in
excess of the Deductible up to a maximum indemnification obligation for such
Losses equal to Seven and One Half Percent (7.5%) of the Final Adjusted Base
Purchase Price (the "Cap"). For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set
forth in this Section 9.4(b) shall not apply to any indemnification
obligations arising in connection with Seller Fundamental Representations and
Warranties. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyer shall not have any liability for indemnification under Section 9.2(b)(i)
(excluding Buyer Fundamental Representation and Warranties) unless the
aggregate of all Losses under such Section exceed the Deductible then only for
Losses in excess of the Deductible up to a maximum indemnification obligation
for such Losses equal to the Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations
set forth in this Section 9.4(c) shall not apply to any indemnification
obligations arising in connection with Buyer Fundamental Representations and
Warranties. (d) The maximum liability of either Party for indemnification of
Losses for breaches of such Party's representations and warranties, including
but not limited to breaches of such Party's Fundamental Representations and
Warranties, shall not exceed 50% of the Final Adjusted Base Purchase Price.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.4(d) shall not be interpreted to
increase the amount of the Cap for any Losses to which the Cap relates. (e)
For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of any
representation or warranty and the amount of any Losses that are the subject
matter of a claim for indemnification hereunder for breach of any
representation or warranty, each representation and warranty shall be read
without regard and without giving effect to any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect standard or qualification contained in such representation or
warranty (as if such standard or qualification were deleted from such
representation and warranty); provided, that (i) any qualification relating to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect to the extent it qualifies an
affirmative requirement to list specified items on a section of the Schedule
shall not be disregarded and (ii) the qualification relating to Material
Adverse Effect in Section 3.7(b) (Absence of Certain Changes) shall not be
disregarded. (f) In addition to the limitation set forth above, payments by an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article IX in respect of any Losses shall
be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after
deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds actually received in respect of any
such claim, net of any costs incurred in connection with obtaining such
insurance proceeds (including any increased premiums resulting therefrom). In
the event that the Indemnified Party maintains insurance that would cover any
Loss for which it has sought indemnification under this Article IX, such
Indemnified Party agrees to make a claim under the applicable insurance
police(ies) in a timely manner to the extent reasonably possible under the
circumstances, and to provide the applicable carrier with such additional
information as it may request with respect to such claim. Nothing contained in
this Article IX or otherwise shall require the Indemnified Party to assert or
threaten to assert any Action against any insurance carrier in connection with
seeking insurance recovery in respect of any Loss for which it has sought
indemnification from the Indemnifying Party hereunder. (g) Each of the Parties
acknowledges and agrees that the right to indemnification or any other remedy
based on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge 71 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement076.jpg) 

acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the
accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to
indemnification or any other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements. (h) None of the limitations contained in this
Article IX shall apply to fraud. Section 9.5 Exclusive Remedies. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims (except in the case of fraud and except for any specific
performance or other injunctive relief to which a Party may be entitled under
the Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions
set forth in this Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to
the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other Party
hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective representatives
arising under or based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX (and excluding any remedy a Party may
have for fraud or specific performance or other injunctive relief to which a
Party may be entitled under this Agreement). ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS Section

Party to this Agreement will bear and pay all fees, costs and expenses

incurred by such Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that Seller will be responsible for all
Company Transaction Expenses. Section 10.2 Notices. All notices, requests,

delivery thereof to the appropriate address or (iii) refusal of the addressee

provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms, conditions and
provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force and effect
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible. Section 10.4 Binding Effect;
Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will be binding
upon and will inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned, directly or
indirectly, including by operation of Law, by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties; provided, however, that Buyer may,
without the consent of Seller, (a) assign the right to acquire all or part of
its rights and interests hereunder to one or more Affiliates, or (b) designate
one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder, but Buyer
will not be relieved of any of its Liabilities under this Agreement. Section
10.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is exclusively for the
benefit of Seller, and its successors and permitted assigns, with respect to
the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, and for the benefit of Buyer,

167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement078.jpg) 

to the obligations of Seller, under this Agreement, and this Agreement will
not be deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy,
claim, Liability, reimbursement, Action or other right. Section 10.6 Section
Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in this Agreement are
exclusively for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
Parties and will not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Section 10.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the other documents delivered pursuant to this
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement. Section 10.8 Consent to Jurisdiction.
Each Party hereby irrevocably agrees that any Legal Dispute will be brought
only in the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Wisconsin or
the federal courts located in the State of Wisconsin, and each Party hereby
consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate
courts therefrom) in any such Legal Dispute and irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such Legal Dispute in any such court or
that any such Legal Dispute that is brought in any such court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum. During the period a Legal Dispute that is filed in
accordance with this Section 10.8 is pending before a court, all Actions with
respect to such Legal Dispute or any other Legal Dispute, including any
counterclaim, cross-claim or interpleader, will be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court. Each Party hereby waives, and will not assert as a
defense in any Legal Dispute, that (a) such Party is not subject thereto, (b)
such Legal Dispute may not be brought or is not maintainable in such court,
(c) such Party's property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such Legal
Dispute is brought in an inconvenient forum or (e) the venue of Legal Dispute
is improper. A final judgment in any Legal Dispute described in this Section
10.8 following the expiration of any period permitted for appeal and subject
to any stay during appeal will be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
applicable Laws. Any dispute, claim, cause of action or proceeding relating to
a claim for indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 9.2 may be commenced at
any time during the period permitted by Section 8106€ of the Delaware Code.
For avoidance of doubt, the foregoing sentence shall not negate the
requirement for the giving of notice of claims within the periods specified in
this Agreement. Section 10.9 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO OR
IN CONNECTION WITH ANY MATTER WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. Section 10.10 Governing Law. This Agreement will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
(regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof) as to all matters, including matters
of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies. Section 10.11
Waiver of Conflicts; Privilege. (a) Each of the Parties acknowledges and
agrees that Husch Blackwell LLP ("HB") has acted as counsel to each of the
Company and the Seller in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement
and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer
hereby 74 US 167664346 HB: 4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement079.jpg) 

consents and agrees to, and agrees to cause the Company to consent and agree
to, HB representing Seller and any of its Affiliates (for the avoidance of
doubt, excluding the Company) (collectively, the "Seller Parties") after the
Closing, including with respect to disputes in which the interests of the
Seller Parties may be directly adverse to Buyer and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company). Buyer further consents and agrees to, and agrees to
cause the Company to consent and agree to, the communication by HB to the
Seller Parties in connection with any such representation of any fact known to
HB arising by reason of HB's prior representation of the Company in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with the
foregoing, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert, and
agrees to cause the Company to irrevocably waive and not to assert, any
conflict of interest arising from or in connection with (i) HB's prior
representation of the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) HB's representation of the Seller Parties prior to
and after the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. (b) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the
Closing, on behalf of the Company, that all communications subject to any
attorney-client privilege, attorney work-product protection or other similar
protection for the benefit of the Seller Parties, in any form or format
whatsoever between or among HB, on one hand, and the Company or any of its
respective directors, officers, employees or other representatives, on the
other hand, prior to the Closing that directly relate to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the
"Privileged Deal Communications") will be deemed to be retained and owned
collectively by the Seller Parties, will be controlled by Seller on behalf of
the Seller Parties and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company.
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a dispute arises between Buyer or the
Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than Seller, on the other
hand, Buyer or the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege, attorney
work-product protection or other similar protection for the benefit of the
Seller Parties to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal Communications
to such third party; provided, however, that neither Buyer nor the Company may
waive any such privilege held by the Seller Parties without the prior written
consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. If Buyer or the Company is legally required by any Order or
otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Privileged
Deal Communications following the Closing, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Buyer will as soon as reasonably practicable notify Seller in
writing (including by making specific reference to this Section 10.11) so that
Seller can seek a protective order and Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, at the Seller Parties' expense, to assist therewith. (d)
To the extent that files or other materials maintained by HB that contain
Privileged Deal Communications constitute property of its clients, only the
Seller Parties will hold such property rights. Section 10.12 Specific
Performance. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any breach of the terms of
this Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy and accordingly the Parties agree that, in
addition to any other remedies, each Party will be entitled to enforce the
terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. Each Party
agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in
connection with such remedy. To the extent any Party hereto brings an Action
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to enforce specifically any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement), the 75 US 167664346 HB:
4845-7978-5147.2  

  

 ![](abrcagreement080.jpg) 

Outside Date shall automatically be extended to the time period established by
the court presiding over such Action. Section 10.13 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be
an original, but all of which will constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
email transmission will be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of the Agreement. Section 10.14 Amendment; Modification; Waiver.
This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented at any time only by
written agreement of the Parties. Any provision of this Agreement may be
waived if, but only if, such waiver is in writing and is signed by the Party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any Party shall
operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or
default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar
or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No
failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or
privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Section 10.15
Schedules. Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule referenced by a
particular Section in this Agreement will be deemed to have been disclosed
with respect to every other Section in this Agreement where it is reasonably
apparent on its face that such disclosure is relevant or applicable to such
other Section. The specification of any dollar amount in the representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific
item in any Schedules is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher or
lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party will use the fact of the setting of such amounts or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether any
obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in a Schedule is
or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. Section 10.16 Non-Party
Affiliates. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action based
upon, arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against, the
entities that are expressly named as parties hereto and then only with respect
to the specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No
past, present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager,
member, general or limited partner, shareholder, equityholder, controlling
person, affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative of any party hereto
or any of their successors or permitted assigns or any direct or indirect
director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member, general or limited
partner, shareholder, equityholder, controlling person, affiliate, agent,
