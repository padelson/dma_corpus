2.2    viii    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN
OF MERGER, dated as of November 19, 2003 ("Agreement"), is made by and
between National City Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("National City"),
and Allegiant Bancorp, Inc., a Missouri corporation ("Allegiant").  
WHEREAS, National City and Allegiant have each determined that it is in the
best interests of their respective stockholders and shareholders
for Allegiant to merge with and into National City upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;   WHEREAS, the respective
Boards of Directors of National City and Allegiant have each approved this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement;   WHEREAS, for
Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the merger shall qualify as
a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"); and   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing premises and the representations, warranties
and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:   I. THE MERGER   1.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 below),
Allegiant will be merged with and into National City and the separate
corporate existence of Allegiant will thereupon cease (the "Merger") in
accordance with the applicable provisions of The Missouri General and
Business Corporation Law ("MGBL") and the Delaware General Corporation Law
("DGCL").   National City may at any time change the method of effecting
the combination with Allegiant (including, without limitation, the provisions
of this Article I) if and to the extent it reasonably deems such change to
be desirable, including, without limitation, to provide for a merger of
Allegiant into a wholly-owned subsidiary of National City; provided, however,
that no such change shall (A) alter or change the amount or kind of
consideration to be issued to holders of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share ("Allegiant Common Stock"), of Allegiant as provided for in
this Agreement, (B) adversely affect the tax treatment of Allegiant\'s
shareholders as a result of receiving the Merger Consideration (as
hereinafter defined) or (C) materially impede or delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   1.2 Effective Time. As soon
as practicable after satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to the Merger
and immediately prior to the Closing (as defined below) which shall occur at
the time set forth in Section 6.1 below, National City and Allegiant
(sometimes together referred to herein as the "Constituent Corporations")
shall cause a certificate of merger complying with the requirements of the
DGCL (the " Delaware Certificate of Merger") to be filed with the   
1   Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and Articles of Merger
complying with the requirements of the MGBL to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Missouri (the "Missouri Articles of Merger"). The
Merger will become effective at the time the later of the following to occur:
(a) the filing of the Delaware Certificate of Merger; (b) the filing of the
Missouri Articles of Merger; or (c) such later time as shall be specified in
such filings ("Effective Time").   1.3 Effect of Merger. The Merger will
have the effects specified in MGBL and DGCL. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, National City will be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and
will continue to be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, and the
separate corporate existence of National City and all of its rights,
privileges, powers and franchises, public as well as private, and all its
debts, liabilities and duties as a corporation organized under the DGCL, will
continue unaffected by the Merger.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of National City in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, which shall be in the form
set forth in a disclosure letter executed by National City and dated and
delivered by National City to Allegiant as of the date hereof (the "National
City Disclosure Letter"), shall be the Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of the Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with
applicable law.   1.5 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of
National City immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors
and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, from and after the
Effective Time, until their successors have been duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the terms of the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws and the DGCL.   1.6 Additional Actions. If, at
any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider
or be advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any
other acts are necessary or desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of
record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of
Allegiant, or (ii) otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
Allegiant and its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts as
are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record
or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in,
to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Allegiant or (b)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Allegiant and its
officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
deeds, assignments or assurances in law and to all acts necessary or proper
to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation and otherwise to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation are authorized in the name of Allegiant or otherwise to
take any and all such action.    2    II. CONVERSION OF SHARES   2.1
Conversion of Shares.   2.1 (a) Conversion Options. Subject to Section 2.2
below, at the Effective Time, each then outstanding share of Allegiant Common
Stock not owned by National City or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of National City (except for any such shares of Allegiant Common
Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts or in any similar manner as
trustee or in a fiduciary capacity ("Trust Account Shares") or acquired in
satisfaction of debts previously contracted ("DPC Shares")), excluding those
shares of Allegiant Common Stock held in the treasury of Allegiant, and
excluding shares with respect to which a written demand for payment of fair
value has been made pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(v) below and not withdrawn or
waived will be canceled, retired and converted into one of the following as
hereinafter provided (subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(d) below):  
(i) a right to receive cash in the amount of Twenty-Seven and 25/100  Dollars
($27.25) ("Cash Payment");   (ii) a right to receive 0.833 shares of common
stock (the  "Conversion Ratio"), par value $4.00 per share ("National City
Common  Stock"), of National City ("Common Stock Payment"); or   (iii) a
right to receive a combination of a portion of Cash Payment  and a portion of
Common Stock Payment ("Combined Payment", which along  with the Cash Payment
and Common Stock Payment is referred to as "Merger  Consideration").   (b)
Election of Common Stock Payment and Cash Payments. Not more than fifteen
(15) days after the Allegiant Meeting (as hereinafter defined) where
the Merger has been approved, National City will cause to be sent to each
record holder of shares of Allegiant Common Stock (as of a record date as
close as practicable to the date of mailing) an election form (an "Election
Form") and other appropriate materials providing for such holders (subject to
the provisions of Section 2.1(d) below):   (i) to elect to receive the Cash
Payment with respect to all of  their shares of Allegiant Common Stock as
hereinabove provided (the "Cash  Election Shares"),   (ii) to elect to
receive the Common Stock Payment with respect to  all of their shares of
Allegiant Common Stock (the "Common Stock Election  Shares"), or   (iii) to
elect to receive the Combined Payment with respect to their  shares of
Allegiant Common Stock (the "Combined Election Shares"). If the  holder
chooses a Combined Payment, then the holder shall specify on the  Election
Form the percentage of the Combined Payment requested to be  received as a
Common Stock Payment and the holder shall be deemed to have  elected that the
balance of his Combined Election Shares shall be  converted into the right to
receive Cash Payment.    3   As of the Election Deadline (as hereinafter
defined) any shares of Allegiant Common Stock with respect to which there
shall not have been an election submission to the Exchange Agent (as
hereinafter defined) of an effective, properly completed Election Form, shall
be deemed to be "No-Election Shares." Except as specifically provided herein,
all No-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election Shares and
references to Cash Election Shares shall be deemed to include No-Election
Shares. The Exchange Agent will use reasonable efforts to make Election Forms
available to all persons who become record holders of Allegiant Common Stock
after the record date set for the mailing of Election Forms and before the
Election Deadline.   (c) Procedure for Election. Any election to receive
Common Stock Payment, Cash Payment or Combined Payment shall have been
validly made only if National City Bank, as Exchange Agent, or such other
national or state bank with which National City may enter into an agreement
whereby such bank shall agree to act as agent for purposes of mailing and
receiving Election Forms, tabulating the results, determining any allocation
and distributing consideration to Allegiant\'s shareholders (the "Exchange
Agent"), shall have received by 4:00 P.M. Cleveland Time on a day (which must
be a business day) selected by National City, but not less than twenty (20)
days after the initial mailing of the Election Forms (the "Election
Deadline"), an Election Form properly completed. An election by a holder of
Allegiant Common Stock shall be validly made only if the Exchange Agent shall
have received an Election Form properly completed and executed (with the
signature or signatures thereon guaranteed as required by the Election Form)
by such shareholder accompanied either by the certificate or certificates
representing all Allegiant Common Stock owned by such shareholder, duly
endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on the
books of Allegiant, or by an appropriate guaranty of delivery in the form
customarily used in transactions of this nature from a member of a national
securities exchange or a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States.
National City shall have the right to make reasonable determinations and to
establish reasonable procedures (not inconsistent with the terms of this
Agreement) in guiding the Exchange Agent in its determination as to validity
of Election Forms.   (i) Two or more holders of Allegiant Common Stock who
are determined  to constructively own the shares of Allegiant Common Stock
owned by each  other by virtue of Section 318(a) of the Code and who so
certify to  National City\'s satisfaction, and any single holder of shares of
Allegiant  Common Stock who holds his shares in two or more different names
and who  so certifies to National City\'s satisfaction, may submit a joint
Election  Form covering the aggregate shares of Allegiant Common Stock owned
by all  such holders or by such single holder as the case may be. For all
purposes  of this Agreement (including any lottery), each such group of
holders  which, and each such single holder who, submits a joint Election
Form  shall be treated as a single holder of Allegiant Common Stock.   (ii)
Record holders of Allegiant Common Stock who are nominees only  may submit a
separate Election Form for each beneficial owner for whom  such record holder
is a nominee; provided, however, that on the request of  National City, such
record holder shall certify to the satisfaction of  National City that such
record holder holds such    4    Allegiant Common Stock as nominee for
the beneficial owner thereof. For  purposes of this Agreement, each
beneficial owner for which an Election  Form is submitted will be treated as
a separate holder of Allegiant Common  Stock, subject, however, to the
immediately preceding sub-paragraph (i)  dealing with joint Election
Forms.   (iii) Any holder of Allegiant Common Stock who has made an
election  by submitting an Election Form to the Exchange Agent may at any
time prior  to the Election Deadline change such holder\'s election by
submitting a  revised Election Form, properly completed and signed, that is
received by  the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any holder of
Allegiant  Common Stock may at any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke
his  election and withdraw his certificates for Allegiant Common Stock 
deposited with the Exchange Agent by written notice to the Exchange Agent 
received by the close of business on the day prior to the Election 
Deadline.   (iv) In the event of the termination of this Agreement after
holders  of Allegiant Common Stock have deposited their shares with the
Exchange  Agent, National City and Allegiant shall promptly instruct the
Exchange  Agent to return all Allegiant Common Stock to the persons who
deposited  the same. Holders of Allegiant Common Stock shall continue to have
the  right to vote and to receive all dividends paid on Allegiant Common
Stock  deposited by them with the Exchange Agent until the Effective
Time.   (v) No holder of Allegiant Common Stock who at the Election
Deadline  is entitled to relief as a dissenting shareholder in compliance
with  Section 351.455 of the MGBL, shall be entitled to submit an Election
Form  and any Election Form submitted by such a dissenting shareholder shall
be  invalid. In the event, that subsequent to the Election Deadline, such 
shareholder ceases to be a dissenting shareholder, the shareholder shall  be
treated the same as a non-dissenting shareholder who failed to submit a 
valid Election Form and shall be deemed to hold No-Election Shares.   (d)
Allocation. As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline, but not more
than ten (10) business days after the Effective Time (the "Allocation Date"),
the Exchange Agent shall effectuate the allocation among holders of Allegiant
Common Stock of rights to receive Common Stock Payment, Cash Payment or
Combined Payment in the Merger as follows:   (i) If the aggregate number of
shares of National City Common Stock  that the holders of the Stock Election
Shares and the portion of the  Common Stock Payment specified on the Election
Forms by holders of  Combined Election Shares are entitled to receive in the
Merger is equal to  or greater than the Stock Conversion Shares, then no
reallocation is to be  made. The "Stock Conversion Shares" means the number
of shares of National  City Common Stock which, when multiplied by the Market
Price, is equal to  51% of the value of the Merger Consideration (including
payments for  fractional shares) and an assumed payment of $27.25 per share
for the  number of shares (the "Dissenting Shares") held by any shareholder
who is  a dissenting shareholder pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(v).   (ii) If
the aggregate number of shares of National City Common Stock  that   
5    the holders of the Stock Election Shares and the portion of the
Common  Stock Payment specified on the Election Forms by holders of
Combined  Election Shares are entitled to receive in the Merger is less than
the  Stock Conversion Shares, then the following reallocation steps shall
be  used (in the order presented) until the number of shares of National
City  Common Stock to be issued in the Merger equals the Stock Conversion 
Shares:   (A) First, all of the Common Stock Election Shares and  the
portion of the Common Stock Payment specified on the  Election Forms by
holders of Combined Election Shares shall be  converted into the right to
receive the number of shares of  National City Common Stock elected pursuant
to the applicable  Election Forms;   (B) Second, the Exchange Agent shall
reallocate the  portion of the Cash Payment deemed specified by holders of 
No-Election Shares such that the Allegiant Common Stock held  by the holders
of No-Election Shares will be converted into  the right to receive in the
aggregate the lesser of (a) the  total number of shares of National City
Common Stock into  which all No-Election Shares are convertible, and (b)
the  number of shares of National City Common Stock which, when  added to
the number of shares of National City Common Stock  issuable in the Merger in
respect of the Common Stock Election  Shares and the portion of the Common
Stock Payment specified  on the Election Forms by holders of Combined
Election Shares,  will equal the number of Stock Conversion Shares, such
shares  to be allocated to each holder of No-Election Shares based  upon the
amount of Cash Payment deemed requested by such  holder compared to the total
amount of Cash Payments deemed  requested by all holders of No-Election
Shares. The Allegiant  Common Stock held by such holders of No-Election
Shares shall  receive cash for the balance of the Merger Consideration, if 
any, to which each such holder is entitled (determined by (x)  dividing the
total Common Stock Payment to be received by such  holder after giving effect
to the reallocation described in  this Section 2.1(d)(ii)(B) by 0.833, (y)
subtracting the  result in (x) from the number of shares of Allegiant
Common  Stock owned by such holder at the Effective Time, and (z) 
multiplying the difference determined in (y) by $27.25 per  share); and  
(C) Third, the Exchange Agent shall reallocate the Cash  Payment portion
specified in the Election Forms by holders of  Combined Election Shares such
that the Allegiant Common Stock  held by the holders of Combined Election
Shares will be  converted into the right to receive in the aggregate the 
lesser of (a) the total number of shares of National City  Common Stock into
which all Combined Election Shares are  convertible, and (b) the number of
shares of National City  Common Stock which, when added to the number of
shares of  National City Common Stock    6    issuable in the Merger in
respect of the Common Stock Election  Shares, the portion of the Common Stock
Payment specified on  the Election Forms by holders of Combined Election
Shares and  the No-Election Shares converted pursuant to Section 
2.1(d)(ii)(B) above, will equal the number of Stock Conversion  Shares, such
shares to be allocated to each holder of Combined  Election Shares based upon
the total amount of Cash Payment  requested by such holder compared to the
total amount of Cash  Payments requested by all holders of Combined Election
Shares.  The Allegiant Common Stock held by such holders shall receive  cash
for the balance of the Merger Consideration, if any, to  which each such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to the  Merger (determined by (x)
dividing the total Common Stock  Payment to be received by such holder after
giving effect to  the reallocation described in this Section 2.1(d)(ii)(C)
by  0.833, (y) subtracting the result in (x) from the number of  shares of
Allegiant Common Stock owned by such holder at the  Effective Time, and (z)
multiplying the difference determined  in (y) by $27.25 per share); and  
(D) Fourth, the Exchange Agent shall reallocate the  portion of the Cash
Payment payable to each holder of Cash  Election Shares (other than No-
Election Shares and Dissenting  Shares) based upon the number of Cash
Election Shares (other  than No-Election Shares and Dissenting Shares) owned
by such  holder compared to the total number of Cash Election Shares  (other
than No-Election Shares and Dissenting Shares) owned by  all such holders,
such that the Allegiant Common Stock held by  the holders of Cash Election
Shares will be converted into the  right to receive in the aggregate the
number of shares of  National City Common Stock which will equal the number
of  shares of National City Common Stock which, when added to the  number of
shares of National City Common Stock issuable in the  Merger in respect of
the Common Stock Election Shares, the  portion of the Common Stock Payment
specified on the Election  Forms by holders of Combined Election Shares, the
No-Election  Shares converted pursuant to Section 2.1(d)(ii)(B) above, and 
the Combined Election Shares converted pursuant to Section  2.1(d)(ii)(C)
above, will equal the number of Stock Conversion  Shares, and such holders of
Cash Election Shares shall receive  in cash the balance of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to  which each such holder is entitled pursuant to the
Merger  (determined by (x) dividing the total Common Stock Payment to  be
received by such holder after giving effect to the  reallocation described in
this Section 2.1(d)(ii)(D) by 0.833,  (y) subtracting the result in (x) from
the number of shares of  Allegiant Common Stock owned by such holder at the
Effective  Time, and (z) multiplying the difference determined in (y) by 
$27.25 per share).   National City shall have the right to make reasonable
determinations  and to establish reasonable procedures in connection with the
allocation  contemplated by this    7    Section 2.1(d)(ii).   (iii)
As soon as practicable, after completion of the allocation  procedure
described above, the Exchange Agent shall distribute the Common  Stock
Payments and the Cash Payments as provided herein. Each share of  Allegiant
Common Stock for which such distribution is made shall be  canceled. National
City will deliver to the Exchange Agent the number of  shares of National
City Common Stock and the amount of Cash Payments  payable in the Merger in
sufficient time for the Exchange Agent to make  such distribution. The
Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or  exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of National  City Common Stock held by
it from time to time hereunder, except that it  shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or  distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the persons  entitled thereto.   (e) Each holder
of Allegiant Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of National City Common Stock shall receive, in lieu
thereof, cash in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of
National City Common Stock multiplied by a ratio, the numerator of which is
$27.25, and the denominator of which is the Conversion Ratio.   (f) At the
Effective Time each share of Allegiant Common Stock held in Allegiant\'s
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, automatically and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof be cancelled.   (g) At the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding share of Allegiant Common Stock owned by National City or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of National City (except for any
shares that are Trust Account Shares or DPC Shares) will be canceled and
retired.   (h) Each share of National City Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be an
issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $4.00 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time.   2.2
Assumption of Stock Options. Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.2
and subject to any required consents by individual option holders, all rights
under any stock option granted by Allegiant or its predecessors pursuant to
Allegiant\'s existing stock option plans (collectively, the "Allegiant Option
Plans") that remain outstanding and unexercised, whether vested or unvested,
immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Unexercised Options") shall cease
to represent a right to acquire shares of Allegiant Common Stock and shall be
converted into the right to acquire that number of shares of National City
Common Stock equal to (a) the number of shares of Allegiant Common Stock
subject to the Unexercised Option, multiplied by (b) the Conversion
Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share). The exercise price per share of
National City Common Stock under the new option shall be equal to the
exercise price per share of Allegiant Common Stock which was purchasable
under each Unexercised Option divided by the Conversion Ratio (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) necessary to assure that the rights and benefits of the
optionee under such option shall not be increased or decreased by reason of
this Section 2.2, and, in addition, each option which is an "incentive stock
option" as defined in    8   Section 422 of the Code shall be adjusted
as required by Section 424 of the Code and the regulations promulgated
thereunder so as not to constitute a modification, extension or renewal of
the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. On or before the
Effective Time, National City shall file, and maintain the effectiveness of,
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") covering such options and the sale of the National City Common
Stock issued upon exercise of such options. At the Effective Time all
Allegiant Option Plans shall be terminated with respect to the granting of
any additional options or option rights. The duration and other terms and
conditions of the new options shall be the same as the original Allegiant
options, except that reference to Allegiant shall be deemed to be references
to National City.   2.3 Exchange of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent.
Prior to the Effective Time, National City shall designate National City Bank
to act as Exchange Agent in connection with the Merger pursuant to an
exchange agent agreement providing for, among other things, the matters set
forth in this Section 2.3. Except as set forth herein, from and after the
Effective Time, each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Allegiant Common Stock
("Certificate") shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
upon surrender thereof to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration for
each share of Allegiant Common Stock so represented by the Certificate
surrendered by such holder thereof. The certificates representing shares of
National City Common Stock which constitute the Merger Consideration shall be
properly issued and countersigned and executed and authenticated, as
appropriate.   (b) Notice of Exchange. Promptly after the Effective Time,
National City and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail and/or make available to each record holder of a Certificate for which
no Election Form was received a notice and letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificate shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificate to the
Exchange Agent) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the procedures to be used in effecting the surrender of the Certificate for
exchange therefore. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereon, and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested, the Exchange Agent shall promptly deliver to the
person entitled thereto the appropriate Merger Consideration for each share
of Allegiant Common Stock so represented by the Certificate surrendered by
such holder thereof, and such Certificate shall forthwith be canceled.  
(c) Transfer. If delivery of all or part of the Merger Consideration is to be
made to a person other than the person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
delivery or exchange that the Certificate surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such delivery or exchange shall have paid any transfer and
other taxes required by reason of such delivery or exchange in a name other
than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax either has    9   been paid or is not payable.   (d) Right to
Merger Consideration. Subject to Section 2.3(e) below, until surrendered and
exchanged in accordance with Section 2.1 or 2.3, each Certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, represent solely the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, payable to the holder of the shares of Allegiant Common Stock
evidenced by such Certificate, together with any dividends or other
distributions as provided in Sections 2.3(e) and 2.3(f) below, and shall have
no other rights. From and after the Effective Time, National City and
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to treat such Certificates that have
not yet been surrendered for exchange as evidencing the right to receive the
aggregate Merger Consideration into which the shares of Allegiant Common
Stock represented by such Certificates may be converted, notwithstanding any
failure to surrender such Certificates. One hundred eighty (180) days
following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to
the Surviving Corporation any shares of National City Common Stock and
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which National
City has made available to the Exchange Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall be
entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the shares of
National City Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares deliverable
or payable upon due surrender of their Certificates. Neither the Exchange
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Allegiant Common Stock for any Merger Consideration (or dividends,
distributions or interest with respect thereto) delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.   (e) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Certificates.
Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by National City on
National City Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, the declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions on all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement, provided
that no dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
National City Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the share of National City Common Stock
represented thereby until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date
prior to the Effective Time which may have been declared or made by Allegiant
on Allegiant Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on
or prior to the Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the Effective
Time.   (f) Lost or Destroyed Exchanged Certificates. In the event that
any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof in form
satisfactory to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration, as may be
required pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the Exchange
Agent may, in its sole discretion and as a condition precedent to the
delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holder of such certificate
is entitled as a result of the Merger, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Allegiant, National City
or the Exchange Agent or any other party with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.    10    (g) Voting
With Respect to Unexchanged Certificates. Holders of unsurrendered
Certificates will not be entitled to vote at any meeting of National City
stockholders.   (h) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional shares of National City Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of a Certificate or Certificates. No
dividends or distributions of National City shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share and any such fractional share interest will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of stockholders of
National City. In lieu of any such fractional shares, holders of Certificates
otherwise entitled to fractional shares shall be entitled to receive promptly
from the Exchange Agent a cash payment in an amount equal to the fraction of
such share of National City Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled multiplied by a ratio, the numerator of which is $27.25, and the
denominator of which is the Conversion Ratio.   2.4 Closing of Allegiant\'s
Transfer Books. The stock transfer books of Allegiant shall be closed at the
close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of the
Effective Time. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Allegiant Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Allegiant, the
Merger Consideration to be distributed pursuant to this Agreement may be
delivered to a transferee, if a Certificate is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes. National City
and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer
books of Allegiant to establish the identity of those persons entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement for their
shares of Allegiant Common Stock, which books shall be conclusive with
respect to the ownership of such shares. In the event of a dispute with
respect to the ownership of any such shares, the Surviving Corporation and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration not
already paid represented thereby in escrow with an independent party and
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims to such Merger
Consideration.   2.5 Changes in National City Common Stock. If between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the shares of National City
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of
any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of
shares, or if a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date
within said period, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
proportionately such that the holders entitled to receive a Common Stock
Payment will receive the same form and amount of National City Common Stock
as if the National City Common Stock issuable pursuant to the Merger had been
outstanding at the record date for such reclassification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares, or dividend.   2.6 Tax
Consequences. This Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for
purposes of Section 368 of the Code. National City and Allegiant agree to
file any and all tax returns in a manner consistent with the qualification as
such.   III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NATIONAL CITY    11   
National City hereby represents and warrants to Allegiant that:   3.1
Corporate Organization. National City is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in

a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). National City is registered as
a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(the "BHCA"). National City has the requisite corporate power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. National City has heretofore delivered
to Allegiant true and complete copies of its Certificate of Incorporation and
By-laws as currently in effect.   3.2 Authority. National City has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The

Directors of National City and no other corporate or stockholder proceedings
on the part of National City are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by, and constitutes valid and binding obligations of
National City enforceable against National City in accordance with its terms,
except as enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,

injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any
proceedings may be brought.   3.3 Capitalization. As of the date hereof, the
authorized capital stock of National City consists of 1,400,000,000 shares of
National City Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of National City preferred

Significant Subsidiaries is a bank, a corporation or a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in
which its ownership or lease of property or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification necessary, except for
such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Significant Subsidiary has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its businesses as they are now being conducted. Except
as set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter, all outstanding shares
of capital stock of each Significant Subsidiary are owned by National City or

13      3.6 Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Except as set forth in
the National City Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by National City nor the consummation by National City of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or result in any
breach of any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of
National City, (b) violate, conflict with, constitute a default (or an event
which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default)
under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any lien or other encumbrance upon

Reports and Financial Statements. Since January 1, 1998, National City and
each of National City\'s subsidiaries have filed all reports, registrations
and statements, together with any required amendments thereto, that they were
required to file with the Commission under Section 12(b), 12(g), 13(a) or
14(a) of the Exchange Act, including, but not limited to Forms 10-K, Forms
10-Q and proxy statements (the "National City Reports"). National City
has previously furnished or will promptly furnish Allegiant with true and
complete copies of each of National City\'s annual reports on Form 10-K for
the years 1998 through 2002 and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the
quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003. As of
their respective dates, the National City Reports complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Commission and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstance under which they were made, not misleading. The audited
consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim financial statements
of National City included in the National City Reports have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto)
and fairly present the consolidated financial position of National City and
National    14  City\'s subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended
subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to normal
year-end and audit adjustments and any other adjustments described therein.
There exist no material liabilities of National City and its consolidated
subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise of a type required to be disclosed in
accordance with generally accepted accounting practices, except as disclosed
in the National City Reports. National City\'s reserve for possible loan
losses as shown in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter
ended September 30, 2003 was adequate, within the meaning of generally
accepted accounting principles and safe and sound banking practices.   3.8
Taxes. National City will promptly make available to Allegiant, upon request
by Allegiant, true and correct copies of the federal, state and local income
tax returns, and state and local property and sales tax returns and any other
tax returns filed by National City and any of National City\'s
subsidiaries for each of the fiscal years that remains open, as of the date
hereof, for examination or assessment of tax. National City and each National
City subsidiary have prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed, or
caused to be duly and timely filed, all federal, state, local and foreign
income, estimated tax, withholding tax, franchise, sales and other tax
returns or reports required to be filed by them on or before the date hereof,
except to the extent that all such failures to file, taken together, would
not have a Material Adverse Effect. National City and each of its
subsidiaries have paid, or have made adequate provision or set up an adequate
accrual or reserve for the payment of, all taxes, shown or required to be
shown to be owing on all such returns or reports, together with any interest,
additions or penalties related to any such taxes or to any open taxable year
or period. Except as set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter,
neither National City nor any of National City\'s subsidiaries has consented
to extend the statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of any
tax. Except as set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter, neither
National City nor any of National City\'s subsidiaries is a party to any
action or proceeding, nor to the best of National City\'s knowledge is
any such action or proceeding threatened, by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the determination, assessment or collection of any taxes, and
no deficiency notices or reports have been received by National City or any
of National City\'s subsidiaries in respect of any material deficiencies for
any tax, assessment, or government charges.   3.9 Employee Plans. Except as
set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter, all employee benefit,
welfare, bonus, deferred compensation, pension, profit sharing, stock option,
employee stock ownership, consulting, severance, or fringe benefit plans,
formal or informal, written or oral, and all trust agreements related
thereto, relating to any present or former directors, officers or employees
of National City or its subsidiaries ("National City Employee Plans") have
been maintained, operated, and administered in substantial compliance with
their terms and currently comply, and have at all relevant times complied, in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), the Code, and
any other applicable laws. With respect to each National City Employee
Plan which is a pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA): (a)
except for recent amendment(s) to the plans not materially affecting the
qualified status of the plans (which are disclosed in, and copies of which
are attached to, the National City Disclosure Letter), each pension plan as
amended (and any trust relating thereto) intended to be a qualified plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code either: (i) has been determined by the
Internal Revenue    15  Service ("IRS") to be so qualified or (ii) is the
subject of a pending application for such determination that was timely
filed, (b) there is no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, and no
waiver of the minimum funding standards of such sections has been requested
from the IRS, (c) neither National City nor any of its subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any pension plan pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, (d) no reportable event described in Section
4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived
has occurred, (e) except as disclosed in the National City Disclosure Letter,
no defined benefit plan has been terminated, nor has the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") instituted proceedings to terminate a defined
benefit plan or to appoint a trustee or administrator of a defined benefit
plan, and no circumstances exist that constitute grounds under Section
4042(a)(2) of ERISA entitling the PBGC to institute any such proceedings and
(f) no pension plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section
3(37) of ERISA or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of 413(c) of
the Code. Neither National City nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any
liability to the PBGC with respect to any "single-employer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA currently or formerly maintained by
any entity considered one employer with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code, except for premiums all of which have been paid when
due. Neither National City nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any
withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA. Except as set forth in the National City Disclosure
Letter, there is no basis for any person to assert that National City or any
of its subsidiaries has an obligation to institute any Employee Plan or any
such other arrangement, agreement or plan. With respect to any insurance
policy that heretofore has or currently does provide funding for benefits
under any National City Employee Plan, (A) there is no liability on the part
of National City or any of its subsidiaries in the nature of a retroactive or
retrospective rate adjustment, loss-sharing arrangement, or other actual
or contingent liability, nor would there be any such liability if such
insurance policy was terminated, and (B) no insurance company issuing such
policy is in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding
and, to the knowledge of National City, no such proceeding with respect to
any such insurer is imminent. Except as set forth in the National City
Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby will (y) constitute a
stated triggering event under any National City Employee Plan that will
result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due
from National City or any of its subsidiaries to any present or former
officer, employee, director, shareholder, consultant or dependent of any of
the foregoing or (z) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due to any present or former officer, employee,
director, shareholder, consultant, or dependent of any of the foregoing.
Neither National City nor any of its subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any National City Employee Plan,
except as set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter. There are no
restrictions on the rights of National City or its subsidiaries to amend or
terminate any such National City Employee Plan without incurring
any liability thereunder.   3.10 Material Contracts. Except as set forth in
the National City Disclosure Letter or disclosed in the National City
Reports, neither National City nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or
is bound or affected by, or receives benefits under (a) any employment,
severance,    16  termination, consulting or retirement agreement
(collectively, "Benefit Agreements") providing for aggregate payments to any
person in any calendar year in excess of $1,000,000, (b) any material
agreement, indenture or other instrument relating to the borrowing of money
by National City or any of its subsidiaries or the guarantee by National City
or any of its subsidiaries of any such obligation (other than trade payables
and instruments relating to borrowings or guaranties made in the ordinary
course of business) or (c) any other contract or agreement or amendment
thereto that would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed
by National City with the Commission as of the date of this Agreement
(collectively, the "National City Contracts"). Neither National City nor any
of National City\'s subsidiaries is in default under any of the National City
Contracts, which default is reasonably likely to have, either individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and there has not occurred any
event that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute such a default. Neither National City nor any of National City\'s
subsidiaries is a party to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining
agreement, contract, or other agreement or understanding with a labor union
or labor organization, nor is National City or any of National
City\'s subsidiaries the subject of a proceeding asserting that it or any
such subsidiary has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel
it or such subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages
and conditions of employment, nor is there any strike or other labor
dispute involving it or any of its subsidiaries pending or threatened.  
3.11 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Except as set forth in
the National City Disclosure Letter or disclosed in the National City Reports
filed by National City with the Commission prior to the date of this
Agreement, since December 31, 2002, there has not been any change in the
financial condition, results of operations or business of National City and
its subsidiaries which would or in the future will have a Material Adverse
Effect.   3.12 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the National City
Disclosure Letter or the National City Reports filed by National City with
the Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no suit, action
or proceeding pending, or, to the knowledge of National City, threatened
against or affecting National City or any of National City\'s subsidiaries
which, if decided adversely to National City, would be reasonably expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any judgment, decree,
injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator,
outstanding against National City or any of National City\'s subsidiaries
having, or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future would
have, a Material Adverse Effect.   3.13 Compliance with Laws and Orders.
Except as set forth in the National City Disclosure Letter or disclosed in
the National City Reports filed by National City with the Commission prior to
the date of this Agreement, the businesses of National City and of National
City\'s subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any law,
ordinance, regulation, judgment, order, decree, license or permit of any
Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, in the case of National
City\'s subsidiaries that are banks, all statutes, rules and regulations

powers), except for violations which individually or in the aggregate do not,

Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the National City Disclosure

Allegiant Option Agreement or any transaction contemplated by such
Agreements.   3.19 Material Interests of Certain Persons. Except as
disclosed in National City\'s Proxy Statement for its 2003 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, no officer or director of National City, or any "associate" (as

National City that:   4.1 Corporate Organization. Allegiant is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Missouri and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease of property
or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such qualification
necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Allegiant is registered
as a bank holding company under the BHCA. Allegiant has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Allegiant
has heretofore delivered to National City true and complete copies of its
Articles of Incorporation and By-laws as currently in effect.   4.2
Authority. Allegiant has the requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and, except for any required approval
of Allegiant\'s shareholders, to consummate the transactions contemplated by
such. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated herein have been duly approved by the Board
of Directors of Allegiant and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Allegiant are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate
the transactions so contemplated, subject only to approval by the
shareholders of Allegiant as provided in Section 5.14 below. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes valid and binding
obligations of Allegiant, enforceable against Allegiant in accordance with
its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent transfer, moratorium and
other similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\' rights generally
and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court
before which any proceedings may be brought.   4.3 Capitalization. As of the
date hereof, the authorized capital stock of Allegiant consists of 30,000,000
shares of Allegiant Common Stock. As of the close of business on November 18,
2003, 17,496,778 shares of Allegiant Common Stock were validly issued
and    21  outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and no shares of
preferred stock were issued or outstanding. As of the date of this Agreement
except as set forth in this Section 4.3, pursuant to Allegiant\'s Option
Plans, pursuant to the Allegiant Option Agreement or set forth in a

rights, convertible securities or any other agreements or commitments of any
character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock or other
securities of Allegiant obligating Allegiant to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock of
Allegiant or obligating Allegiant to grant, extend or enter into any
subscription, option, warrant, right, convertible security or other similar
agreement or commitment. Except as set forth in the Allegiant
Disclosure Letter, there are no voting trusts or other agreements or

Allegiant stock options had a weighted average exercise price of $14.20 and
for which adequate shares of Allegiant Common Stock have been reserved for
issuance under Allegiant Option Plans.   4.4 Subsidiaries. The Allegiant
Disclosure Letter sets forth the name and state of incorporation of each
subsidiary of Allegiant (collectively, "Allegiant Subsidiaries" and each an
"Allegiant Subsidiary"). Each Allegiant Subsidiary is a bank, a corporation
or other business entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation or
foreign business entity in each jurisdiction in which its ownership or lease
of property or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure
to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect. Each Allegiant
Subsidiary has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its businesses as they are
now being conducted. All outstanding shares of capital stock of each
Allegiant Subsidiary is owned by Allegiant or another Allegiant Subsidiary

to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply as to form in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.   4.6 Consent and Approvals; No
Violation. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter, neither

consummation by Allegiant of the transactions contemplated hereby will (a)
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of its Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of Allegiant, (b) violate,
conflict with, constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the
termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in the
creation of any lien or other encumbrance upon any of the properties or
assets of Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed
of trust, license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
which Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary is a party or to which they or
any of their respective properties or assets are subject, except for such
violations, conflicts, breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or

Statements. Since January 1, 1998, Allegiant and each Allegiant Subsidiary
have filed all reports, registrations and statements, together with any
required amendments thereto, that they were required to file with the
Commission under Section 12(b), 12(g), 13(a) or 14(a) of the Exchange Act,
including, but not limited to Forms 10-K, Forms 10-Q and proxy statements

and its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2003,
June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003. As of their respective dates, the
Allegiant Reports complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Commission and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstance under which they
were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial statements and
unaudited interim financial statements of Allegiant included in the Allegiant
Reports have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated therein
or in the notes thereto) and fairly present the financial position of
Allegiant and Allegiant Subsidiaries taken    23  as a whole as at the
dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal year-end and audit adjustments and any other
adjustments described therein. There exist no material liabilities of
Allegiant and its consolidated subsidiaries, contingent or otherwise of
a type required to be disclosed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting practices, except as disclosed in the Allegiant Reports.
Allegiant\'s reserve for possible loan losses as shown in its Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2003 was
adequate, within the meaning of generally accepted accounting principles and
safe and sound banking practices.   4.8 Taxes. Allegiant will promptly make
available to National City, upon request by National City, true and correct
copies of the federal, state and local income tax returns, and state and

Allegiant Disclosure Letter, Allegiant and each Allegiant Subsidiary have
prepared in good faith and duly and timely filed, or caused to be duly and
timely filed, all federal, state, local and foreign income, estimated tax,
withholding tax, franchise, sales and other tax returns or reports required
to be filed by them on or before the date hereof, except to the extent that
all such failures to file, taken together, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter, Allegiant and
each Allegiant Subsidiary have paid, or have made adequate provision or set
up an adequate accrual or reserve for the payment of, all taxes shown or
required to be shown to be owing on all such returns or reports, together
with any interest, additions or penalties related to any such taxes or to any
open taxable year or period. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure
Letter, neither Allegiant nor any of Allegiant\'s Subsidiaries has consented
to extend the statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of any
tax. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter,
neither Allegiant nor any of Allegiant Subsidiaries is a party to any action
or proceeding, nor to the best of Allegiant\'s knowledge is any such action
or proceeding threatened, by any Governmental Entity in connection with
the determination, assessment or collection of any taxes, and no deficiency
notices or reports have been received by Allegiant or any of Allegiant
Subsidiaries in respect of any material deficiencies for any tax, assessment,
or government charge.   4.9 Employee Plans. Except as set forth in the
Allegiant Disclosure Letter, all employee benefit, welfare, bonus, deferred
compensation, pension, profit sharing, stock option, employee stock
ownership, consulting, severance, or fringe benefit plans, formal or
informal, written or oral and all trust agreements related thereto, relating
to any present or former directors, officers or employees of Allegiant or
Allegiant Subsidiaries ("Allegiant Employee Plans") have been maintained,
operated, and administered in substantial compliance with their terms and
currently comply, and have at all relevant times complied, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of ERISA, the Code, and any other
applicable laws. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter, with
respect to each Allegiant Employee Plan which is a pension plan (as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA): (a) except for recent amendment(s) to the plans
not materially affecting the qualified status of the plans (which are
disclosed in, and copies of which are attached to, the Allegiant Disclosure
Letter), each pension plan as amended (and any trust relating thereto)
intended to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code either (i)
has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified or (ii) is the subject of a
pending    24  application for such determination that was timely filed,
(b) there is no accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in Section 302 of
ERISA and Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, and no waiver of
the minimum funding standards of such sections has been requested from the
IRS, (c) neither Allegiant nor any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries has
provided, or is required to provide, security to any pension plan pursuant to
Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, (d) no reportable event described in Section
4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived
has occurred, (e) no defined benefit plan has been terminated, nor has the
PBGC instituted proceedings to terminate a defined benefit plan or to appoint
a trustee or administrator of a defined benefit plan, and no circumstances
exist that constitute grounds under Section 4042(a)(2) of ERISA entitling the
PBGC to institute any such proceedings and (f) no pension plan is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.
Neither Allegiant nor any Allegiant Subsidiary has incurred any liability to
the PBGC with respect to any "single-employer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA currently or formerly maintained by any entity
considered one employer with it under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of
the Code, except for premiums all of which have been paid when due. Neither
Allegiant nor any of its subsidiaries has incurred any withdrawal liability
with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA.
There is no basis for any person to assert that Allegiant or any of
its subsidiaries has an obligation to institute any Employee Plan or any such
other arrangement, agreement or plan. With respect to any insurance policy
that heretofore has or currently does provide funding for benefits under
any Allegiant Employee Plan, (A) there is no liability on the part of
Allegiant or any of its subsidiaries in the nature of a retroactive or
retrospective rate adjustment, loss-sharing arrangement, or other actual or
contingent liability, not would there be any such liability if such insurance
policy was terminated, and (B) no insurance company issuing such policy is in
receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the
knowledge of Allegiant, no such proceeding with respect to any such insurer
is imminent. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter, neither
the execution of this Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby will (A) constitute a stated triggering event under any
Allegiant Employee Plan that will result in any payment (whether of severance
pay or otherwise) becoming due from Allegiant or any of its subsidiaries to
any present or former officer, employee, director, shareholder, consultant or
dependent of any of the foregoing or (B) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any present or former
officer, employee, director, shareholder, consultant, or dependent of any of
the foregoing. Neither Allegiant nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under any Allegiant Employee
Plan, except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter. Except as set
forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter, there are no restrictions on the
rights of Allegiant or Allegiant Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any such
Allegiant Employee Plan without incurring any liability thereunder.   4.10
Material Contracts. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter or
disclosed in the Allegiant Reports, neither Allegiant nor any Allegiant
Subsidiary is a party to, or is bound or affected by, or receives benefits
under (a) any Benefit Agreements providing for aggregate payments to any
person in any calendar year in excess of $50,000, (b) any material agreement,
indenture or other instrument relating to the borrowing of money by Allegiant
or any Allegiant Subsidiary or the guarantee by Allegiant or any Allegiant
Subsidiary of any such    25  obligation (other than trade payables and
instruments relating to transactions entered into in the ordinary course of
business) or (c) any other contract or agreement or amendment thereto that
would be required to be filed as an exhibit to a Form 10-K filed by Allegiant
with the Commission as of the date of this Agreement (collectively, the
"Allegiant Contracts"). Neither Allegiant nor any Allegiant Subsidiary is in
default under any Allegiant Contract, which default is reasonably likely to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, and
there has not occurred any event that with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both would constitute such a default. Except as set forth in
Allegiant Disclosure Letter, neither Allegiant nor any Allegiant Subsidiary
is a party to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract,
or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization,
nor is Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary the subject of a proceeding
asserting that is or any Allegiant Subsidiary has committed an unfair labor
practice or seeking to compel it or such subsidiary to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages and conditions of employment, nor is there any
strike or other labor dispute involving it or any Allegiant
Subsidiary pending or threatened.   4.11 Absence of Certain Changes or
Events. Except as set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter or disclosed
in the Allegiant Reports filed by Allegiant with the Commission prior to the
date of this Agreement, since December 31, 2002, there has not been any
change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of
Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary which would or in the future will have
a Material Adverse Effect.   4.12 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the
Allegiant Reports filed by Allegiant with the Commission prior to the date of
this Agreement, there is no suit, action or proceeding pending, or, to the
knowledge of Allegiant, threatened against or affecting Allegiant or any
Allegiant Subsidiary which, if determined adversely to Allegiant, would be
reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any
judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Governmental Entity or
arbitrator, outstanding against Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary having,
or which, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future would have, a
Material Adverse Effect on the banking industry generally.   4.13
Compliance with Laws and Orders. Except as set forth in the Allegiant
Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Allegiant Reports filed by Allegiant
with the Commission prior to the date of this Agreement, the businesses of
Allegiant and each Allegiant Subsidiary are not being conducted in violation
of any law, ordinance, regulation, judgment, order, decree, license or permit
of any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, in the case of an
Allegiant Subsidiary that is a bank, all statutes, rules and
regulations pertaining to the conduct of the banking business and the
exercise of trust powers), except for violations which individually or in the
aggregate do not, and, insofar as reasonably can be foreseen, in the future
will not, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in the
Allegiant Disclosure Letter, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary is pending or,
to the knowledge of Allegiant threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct the same in each case other than those the
outcome of which will not have a Material Adverse Effect.   4.14 Agreements

Subsidiary is a party to any written agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or a party to any commitment letter, board resolution or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient
of any extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Governmental Entity which

is required by Section 32 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to give prior

Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-laws as currently in effect.

business of Allegiant or any of its subsidiaries.   4.22 Allegiant
Disclosure Letter. The Allegiant Disclosure Letter is arranged in a format in
which the disclosures made therein are arranged in paragraphs or sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections of this

warranty to which such disclosure paragraph or section relates and no
implication or inference shall be made in any other representation or
warranty.   4.23 Notice of Breach or Potential Breach. Allegiant shall
promptly notify National City of any change, circumstance or event which
would cause any of the representations    28  or warranties made by

obligations hereunder. There is no fact or development known to Allegiant

Allegiant\'s reasonable judgment, have a Material Adverse Effect,
on Allegiant\'s or its Subsidiaries\' continuing business, which has not been
set forth in this Agreement.   4.24 Disclosure. No representation or
warranty by Allegiant in this Agreement after giving effect to the
disclosures set forth in the Allegiant Disclosure Letter, contains any untrue

not materially misleading. Any claim by National City for a breach of
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of Allegiant

Board of Directors of Allegiant is required, in a written opinion of counsel
to the Board of Directors of Allegiant, in the exercise of its fiduciary
duties in accordance with applicable law, to participate in any discussion or
negotiation regarding, or furnish to any other person any information with
respect to, an Acquisition Transaction; provided, however, that nothing
contained in this Section 5.1 shall restrict or prohibit any disclosure by
Allegiant that is required in any document to be filed with the Commission
after the date of this Agreement or any disclosure that, in the written
opinion of counsel to the Board of Directors of Allegiant, is otherwise
required under applicable law. Allegiant will, and cause each Allegiant
Subsidiary to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any of the foregoing. Allegiant will notify National City
immediately if any such inquiries or proposals are received by, any
such information is requested from, or any such negotiation or discussion are
sought to be initiated or continued with Allegiant or any Allegiant
Subsidiary with respect to a proposed Acquisition Transaction.   5.2

Merger to either party.   (c) Capital Stock. Allegiant shall not, and shall
not permit any  Allegiant Subsidiary to, issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or any  other securities of any of them (other than pursuant to

reinvestment plans) or issue any securities convertible into or  exchangeable
for, or options, warrants to purchase, scrip, rights to  subscribe for, calls

duplication of nor  omission of payment of dividends to shareholders of
Allegiant in  connection with consummation of the Merger.   (e) Employee
Plans, Compensation, Etc. Except as otherwise  provided in this Agreement,
Allegiant shall not, and shall not permit any  Allegiant Subsidiary to, adopt
or amend (except as required by law or  other contractual obligations
existing on the date hereof) any bonus,  profit sharing, compensation,
severance, termination, stock option,  pension, retirement, deferred
compensation, employment or other employee  benefit agreements, trusts,
plans, funds or other arrangements for the  benefit or welfare of any
director, officer or employee, or (except for  normal merit increases in the
ordinary course of business consistent with  past practice not to exceed 2.0%

director, officer or employee or  pay any benefit not required by any

loan,  litigation, real estate valuation, asset, liquidity and investment 
portfolio policies and practices (including loan classifications and level 
of reserves) prior to the Effective Time so as to be consistent on a 
mutually satisfactory basis with those of National City and generally 
accepted accounting principles, at the earlier of (i) such time as  National
City acknowledges that all conditions to its obligations to  consummate the
Merger set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 below have been  waived or satisfied
or (ii) immediately prior to the Effective Time.  Allegiant\'s
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this  Agreement shall
not be deemed to be untrue or breached in any respect for  any purpose as a
consequence of any such modifications or changes.   5.3 Interim Operations
of National City. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, without the prior written consent of Allegiant, National City
will not declare or pay any extraordinary or special dividend on the National
City Common Stock or take any action that would (a) materially delay or
adversely affect the ability of National City to obtain any approvals of
Governmental Authorities required to permit consummation of the Merger or (b)
materially adversely affect its ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby.   5.4
Employee Matters.   (a) Benefit Agreements. Surviving Corporation and

Time, without  deduction, counterclaims, interruptions or deferment (other
than  withholding under applicable law), all vested benefits of any person
under  all existing plans or agreements.   (b) Retirement and Benefit
Plans. For purposes of all employee  benefit plans,    31   programs or
arrangements maintained or contributed to by National City or  Surviving
Corporation, National City shall credit or shall cause Surviving  Corporation
to credit employees of Allegiant and Allegiant Subsidiaries  who become
employees of National City or Surviving Corporation as a result  of the
Merger with all service with Allegiant; any Allegiant Subsidiaries;  or any
predecessor employer (to the extent such service has been  recognized by
Allegiant under Allegiant Employee Plans) for purposes of  eligibility and
vesting as if such service, and compensation from, had  been performed for
National City or a subsidiary thereof but not for  purposes of benefit
accrual; provided, however, that this provision shall  not change the
treatment under the National City Non-Contributory  Retirement Plan and Trust
of service with National City or any of National  City\'s subsidiaries prior
to the Closing Date. From and after the  Effective Time, National City shall,
or shall cause Surviving Corporation  to, cause any and all pre-existing
condition limitations under any health  plans or long-term disability plans
to be waived with respect to Allegiant  Employees and; with respect to health
plans their eligible dependents; to  the extent that such conditions were
covered by Allegiant\'s health and  disability plans. National City shall
credit, or cause the Surviving  Corporation to credit, employees of Allegiant
and Allegiant Subsidiaries  and their eligible dependents with year-to-date
deductibles and  out-of-pocket expenses incurred under Allegiant\'s health
plan toward  satisfaction of applicable deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses under  any applicable National City or Surviving Corporation health
plan for the  plan year in which the Merger occurs.   (c) Transition. Upon

aggregate are no less favorable than the  benefits enjoyed generally by
National City employees working in similar  business lines.   5.5 Access
and Information. Upon reasonable notice, Allegiant shall, and shall cause
each Allegiant Subsidiary to, afford to National City and its representatives
(including, without limitation, directors, officers and employees of National
City and its affiliates, and counsel, accountants and other professionals
retained) such access during normal business hours throughout the period
prior to the Effective Time to the books, records (including, without
limitation, tax returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties,
personnel and to such other information as National City may reasonably
request; provided, however, that Allegiant shall not be required to provide
access to any such information or properties if the providing of such access
(i) would be reasonably likely, in the written opinion of counsel, to result
in the loss or impairment of any privilege generally recognized under
law with respect to such information or (ii) would be precluded by any
lease, contract or legally enforceable agreement in existence prior to the
date hereof or by any law, ordinance, regulation, judgment, order, decree,
license or permit of any Governmental Entity. All information furnished by
one party to the other party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be kept confidential by such other
party (and shall be used by it only in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby) except to the extent that such information
(x) already is known to such other party when received from a source not
known by the receiving party to be under an obligation of confidentiality,
(y) thereafter becomes lawfully obtainable from other sources or (z) is
required to be disclosed in any non-confidential document filed with the
Commission, the FRB, the Department of Justice or any other agency or   
32  any government. In the event that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall fail to consummate, each party shall promptly cause all
copies of documents or extracts thereof containing information and data as to
another party hereto to be returned to the party that furnished the same or
be destroyed.   5.6 Certain Filings, Consents and Arrangements. National
City and Allegiant shall (a) as soon as practicable make any required filings
and applications required to be filed with Governmental Entities between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, (b) cooperate with one another
(i) in promptly determining whether any other filings are required to be made
or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained
under any other relevant federal, state or foreign law or regulation and (ii)
in promptly making any such filings, furnishing information required in
connection therewith and seeking timely to obtain any such consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations and (c) deliver to the other parties to
this Agreement copies of the publicly available portions of all such reports
promptly after they are filed.   5.7 State Takeover Statutes. Allegiant
shall take all reasonable steps to (i) exempt Allegiant and the Merger from
the requirements of any state takeover law by action of Allegiant\'s Board of
Directors or otherwise and (ii), upon the request of National City, assist in
any challenge by National City to the applicability to the Merger of any
state takeover law.   5.8 Indemnification. From and after the Effective
Time, National City will assume and honor any obligation as provided for and
permitted by applicable federal and state law Allegiant had immediately prior
to the Effective Time with respect to the indemnification of each person who
is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, a director or officer of Allegiant or any Allegiant
Subsidiary (collectively, the "Indemnitees") arising out of Allegiant\'s
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or By-laws or any
indemnification (to the maximum extent available thereunder and permitted by
applicable law or regulation) against any and all Losses in connection with
or arising out of any claim which is based upon, arises out of or in any way
relates to any actual or alleged condition, act or omission occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, including any actions taken to approve and
implement this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in the
Indemnitee\'s capacity as a director or officer (whether elected or
appointed), of Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiary. This Section 5.8
will be construed as an agreement, as to which the Indemnitees are intended
to be third-party beneficiaries. In addition, at National City\'s election,
for a period of two years after the Effective Time, National City will
provide for coverage of Indemnitees under National City\'s directors and
officers insurance policy or, alternatively, cause Allegiant to purchase tail
coverage under its directors and officers insurance policy for such
period.   5.9 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions
herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions and to
do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using its best efforts to obtain all necessary actions
or non-actions, extensions, waivers,    33  consents and approvals from
all applicable Governmental Entities, effecting all necessary registrations,
applications and filings and obtaining any required contractual consents and
regulatory approvals.   5.10 Publicity. The initial press release announcing
this Agreement shall be a joint press release and thereafter Allegiant and
National City shall consult with each other in issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and in making any filings with any Governmental Entity or
with any national securities exchange with respect thereto.   5.11
Registration Statement. National City shall prepare and file the Registration
Statement with the Commission as soon as is reasonably practicable following
receipt of final comments from the Staff of the Commission on the Proxy
Statement (or advice that such Staff will not review such filing) and shall
use all reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement
declared effective by the Commission as promptly as practicable and to
maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement. National City
shall also take any action required to be taken under state blue sky or
securities laws in connection with the issuance of the National City Common
Stock pursuant to the Merger, and Allegiant shall furnish National City all
information concerning Allegiant and the holders of its capital stock and
shall take any action as National City may reasonably request in connection
with any such action.   5.12 Proxy. As soon as practicable after the date
hereof, Allegiant shall prepare the Proxy Statement, file it with the
Commission, respond to any comments of the Staff of the Commission, clear the
Proxy Statement with the Staff of the Commission and promptly thereafter mail
the Proxy Statement to all holders of shares of Allegiant Common Stock.
National City and Allegiant shall cooperate with each other in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement.   5.13 Stock Exchange Listings. National
City shall use its best efforts to list on the New York Stock Exchange, upon

in accordance with applicable law and its Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws, to convene a special meeting of the holders of Allegiant Common Stock
(the "Allegiant Meeting") as promptly as practicable for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless the Board of Directors of Allegiant shall have
received the written advice of counsel, reasonably acceptable to National
City, to the effect that making such a recommendation would cause the Board
of Directors of Allegiant to violate its fiduciary duty under applicable law
and provided that such advice is not predicated solely upon the market price
of National City Common Stock, the Board of Directors of Allegiant shall
recommend that the holders of Allegiant Common Stock vote in favor of and
approve the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and adopt this
Agreement at the Allegiant Meeting.   5.15 Tax-Free Reorganization
Treatment. Neither National City nor Allegiant shall take or cause to be
taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, which
would    34  disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Prior to the Effective Time, each party
shall cooperate with the other party to cause the Merger to qualify as a
reorganization under Section 368 of the Code and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the opinion referred to in Section 7.1(f) and, in
connection therewith, each of Allegiant, National City, and any wholly-owned
subsidiary of National City, to the extent Allegiant is merged into such
subsidiary, shall deliver to counsel referred to in Section 7.1(f) customary
and reasonable representation letters in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such counsel and National City, as applicable.   5.16
Provision of Shares. National City shall issue and provide the shares of
National City Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of Allegiant
Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, and will provide the cash for Cash
Payments and to be paid in lieu of fractional shares of National City Common
Stock as provided in Section 2.1 above. The shares of National City Common
Stock to be issued and exchanged for shares of Allegiant Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement will, at the Effective Time, be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and subject to no
preemptive rights.   5.17 Adverse Action. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time, except as expressly contemplated by the Agreement, neither
party will, without the written consent of the other party (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) knowingly take any action that
would, or would be reasonably likely to result in (a) any of its
representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement being or becoming
untrue, (b) any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII
below not being satisfied or (c) a material violation of any provision of the
Agreement except, in each case, as may be required by applicable law.   VI.

conditions precedent set forth in Article VII below, the closing (the

accordance with the approvals of any Governmental Entities; or   (b) the

conditions are determined to be satisfied in all material respects (or are

respective best efforts, on or prior to Closing, to execute and deliver all
such instruments, documents or certificates as may be necessary or advisable,
on the advice of counsel, for the consummation    35  at the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur as soon as

imposed by, any Governmental Entity  (collectively, "Consents") which are
necessary for the consummation of the  Merger, (other than immaterial
Consents, the failure to obtain which would  not be materially adverse to,
National City and National City\'s  subsidiaries or Allegiant and Allegiant
Subsidiaries taken as a whole)  shall have been obtained or shall have
occurred and shall be in full force  and effect at the Effective Time;
provided, however, that no such  authorization, consent, order or approval
shall be deemed to have been  received if it shall include any conditions or
requirements which would so  materially adversely impact the economic or
business benefits of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as
to render inadvisable in  the reasonable opinion of National City the
consummation of the Merger.   (d) The Registration Statement shall have
become effective in  accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act. No
stop order  suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall
have been  issued by the Commission and remain in effect.   (e) No

order by any federal or state court in the United  States which prevents the
consummation of the Merger shall have been  issued and remain in effect.  
(f) Thompson Coburn LLP counsel to Allegiant, shall have delivered  to
Allegiant and National City their opinion, dated the day of the  Effective
Time, which shall provide that it may be relied upon by National  City and
the shareholders of Allegiant substantially to the effect that,  on the basis
of facts, representations and assumptions set forth in such  opinion which
are consistent with the state of facts existing at the  Effective Time, the
Merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes  as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and  that, accordingly: (i)
each of Allegiant, National City and any  wholly-owned subsidiary of National
City, to the extent Allegiant is  merged into such subsidiary, are each
parties to a reorganization within  the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code; (ii) no gain or loss will be  recognized by National    36   City
or Allegiant as a result of the Merger; (iii) no gain or loss will be 
recognized by the shareholders of Allegiant pursuant to the Merger (except 
with respect to consideration received as a result of cash paid in lieu of 
fractional shares, cash paid as a result of the exercise of dissenters 
rights or Cash Payments made to such shareholders); (iv) the tax basis of 
the shares of National City Common Stock received by shareholders who 
exchange all of their shares of Allegiant Common Stock solely for shares  of
National City Common Stock in the Merger will be the same as the tax  basis
of the shares of Allegiant Common Stock surrendered in exchange  therefor
(reduced by any cash received and increased by the amount treated  as a
dividend, if any, and by the amount of gain recognized on the  exchange (not
including any portion of the gain treated as a dividend);  and (v) the
holding period of the shares of National City Common Stock  received in the
Merger will include the period during which the shares of  Allegiant Common
Stock surrendered in exchange therefore were held,  provided such shares of
Allegiant Common Stock were held as capital assets  at the Effective Time. In
rendering such opinion, counsel may rely upon  representations contained in
certificates of officers of Allegiant,  National City, and others.   7.2

Proposal) at any  time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
taking of the  vote of the shareholders of Allegiant contemplated by this
Agreement  at the Allegiant Meeting and this Agreement is terminated by 
National City pursuant to Section 8.1(f)(iv) above and the  shareholders of
Allegiant do not approve the Merger at the Allegiant  Meeting or any
adjournment thereof as contemplated hereunder, then  within two (2) business
days after the effective date of  termination, Allegiant shall remit to
National City the Breakup Fee.   Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to
this Section 8.10(b)  shall be paid    43   by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated  by National City.

otherwise limit the rights of  the non-breaching party.   8.11 Enforcement
of the Agreement. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not

It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.   8.12 Severability.

terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any party
hereto. Upon any such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto

Allegiant which are a result of events which occur after the date hereof;
provided, however, that, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i)
no exceptions or other information set forth on any such updated or
supplemented Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to cure any representation or
warranty which was not true and correct as of the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) the exceptions and other information set forth on any such updated or
supplemented Disclosure Letter shall not be taken into consideration in
determining, for purposes of this Agreement, whether the conditions set
forth in Section 7.3 in the case of National City, and Section 7.2 hereof in
the case of Allegiant shall have been satisfied, and (iii) this Section 8.13
shall not relieve any party of its obligations under any covenant set forth
