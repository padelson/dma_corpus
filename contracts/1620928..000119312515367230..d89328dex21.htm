CONVEYANCES, ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

 

2.1 _Conveyances_. At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, Rice shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to the
Partnership the Conveyed Interests free and clear of all Liens other than
Liens under the Organizational Documents of the Rice Water Entities and
restrictions on transfer under applicable securities Laws, in exchange for
the Consideration, and the Partnership shall accept the sale, assignment,
transfer and conveyance of the Conveyed Interests.

2.2  _Consideration_. At the Closing, in consideration for the sale and
conveyance of the Conveyed Interests, the Partnership shall pay Rice
$200,000,000.00, in cash.

 

2.3 _Earn-Out Payments_.

 

(a) Following the Closing and as additional consideration for the conveyance
by Rice to the Partnership of the Conveyed Interests, Rice shall be entitled
to receive from the Partnership (subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Section 2.3_) cash determined in accordance with this _Section 2.3_ (the "
_Earn-Out Payment_ "). In addition to the consideration set forth in _Section
2.2_ above, Rice shall be entitled to a cash payment equal to (i)
$25,000,000.00, less the Incremental Capacity Capex, if, on or prior to
December 31, 2017 (the " _Earn-Out Term_ "), the aggregate amount of
Incremental Capacity equals or exceeds 5 MMgal/d (the " _Earn-Out Threshold_
") following the Effective Date.

 

(b) Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal quarter during the Earn-Out
Term, the Partnership shall in good faith prepare and deliver to Rice a
report setting forth the Incremental Capacity and the Incremental Capacity
Capex incurred in the fiscal quarter as well as any other information that
Rice may reasonably request in order to verify such Incremental Capacity and
Incremental Capacity Capex (the " _Earn-Out Report_ "). The Earn-Out Report
and the Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity Capex reflected thereon
shall be final and binding upon Rice and the Partnership upon the approval of
such Earn-Out Report by Rice, in a written notice that specifically states
such approval and references this _Section 2.3(b)_, or the failure of Rice to
object in a written notice to the Partnership that specifically references
this  _Section 2.3(b)_ within 15 days after receipt of the Earn-Out Report
by Rice. If Rice does not agree with the Earn-Out Report and the calculation
of the Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity Capex stated thereon, and
Rice and the Partnership cannot mutually agree on the calculation of the
Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity Capex, then, if based on Rices
calculation of Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity Capex it would be
entitled to the Earn-Out Payment, within 45 days following receipt by Rice of
the Earn-Out Report, the Partnership and Rice shall resolve such dispute (the
" _Earn-Out Report Dispute_ ") in accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_. If no
such Earn-Out Payment would be required to be paid based on Rices
calculation, then any dispute resolution procedure should be deferred until
the next quarter. If at any time the

 



-10-  Partnership and Rice resolve the Earn-Out Report Dispute, then
notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this _Section 2.3(b)_ and
_Section 2.3(c)_, the dispute resolution procedures in _Section 2.3(c)_
promptly shall be discontinued with respect to such agreed matters and the
Earn-Out Report and the Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity Capex
shall be revised, if necessary to reflect such resolution and thereupon shall
become binding upon Rice and the Partnership for purposes hereof. The Earn-Out
Payment, if any, that the Partnership becomes obligated to pay to Rice (by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts specified by Rice) pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be paid to
Rice within five Business Days of the determination of the Earn-Out Payment
becoming final and binding upon the Parties in accordance with _Section
2.3(b)_.

 

(c) If Rice and the Partnership are unable to resolve an Earn-Out Report
Dispute as contemplated by _Section 2.3(b)_, then such Earn-Out Report
Dispute shall be submitted to mandatory and binding arbitration pursuant to
the following conditions:



     | (i) | _Procedures_. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant

pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Section 2.3(c)_ (each, an "
_Arbitrator_ "). In resolving the substance of the Earn-Out Report Dispute,
the Arbitrators shall apply the laws of the State of Texas provided, however,
that no aspect of the 1987 Alternative Dispute Resolution Act shall be applied
to the arbitration proceeding. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | _Selection of Arbitrators_. The Earn-Out Report Dispute
will be resolved by a panel of three Arbitrators, unless Rice and the
Partnership mutually agree upon the selection of a single Arbitrator. Within
15 days after a failure to resolve any dispute in an Earn-Out Report in
accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_, each of Rice and the Partnership shall
appoint one person to serve as an Arbitrator and, within 10 days after the
later to occur of such appointments, the two appointed Arbitrators shall
mutually agree to appoint a third Arbitrator, failing agreement on which such
third Arbitrator shall be appointed by AAA in accordance with its rules. If
either Rice or the Partnership does not appoint an Arbitrator within 15 days
after such failure to resolve any dispute regarding the calculation of the
Incremental Capacity and Incremental Capacity Capex in an Earn-Out Report in
accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_, then the other party may submit an
appropriate request to the AAA to initiate proceedings and AAA shall select
such Arbitrator in accordance with its rules. Should any Arbitrator refuse or
be unable to proceed with arbitration proceedings as called for in this 
_Section 2.3(c)_, such Arbitrator shall be replaced by AAA in accordance with
_Section 2.3(c)(viii)_ below. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | _Place of Arbitration_. The arbitration shall be held in
Houston, Texas. 
---|---|--- 
 



-11- reasonable discovery in the forms permitted by the AAA Rules, to the extent
consistent with the purposes of the arbitration. Recognizing the express
desire of the parties for an expeditious means of dispute resolution, the
Arbitrators shall limit or allow the parties to expand the scope of discovery
as may be reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. The arbitration
hearing shall be commenced promptly and conducted expeditiously. If one party
seeks discovery of electronic communications, such as emails, from another
party, the Arbitrators shall have the authority to impose reasonable limits on
the timing and extent of such discovery, and allow the producing party to
recover reasonable expenses and costs associated with that discovery. Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitration hearing shall be conducted on
consecutive days. The Arbitrators must give effect to legal privileges
including the attorney-client privilege and work-product immunity. The
Arbitrators shall act by majority vote in resolving all Earn-Out Report
Disputes. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | _Arbitration Award_. The Arbitrators shall endeavor to
render a binding, written decision within 14 days following the completion of
the arbitration hearing. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | _Binding Nature of the Arbitration Award_. The arbitration
award shall be binding on the parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction, and may not be appealed except to
the extent permitted by the Federal Arbitration Act. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | _Time of the Essence_. The Arbitrators are to be
instructed that time is of the essence in the arbitration proceeding. 
---|---|--- 



     | (viii) | _Replacement of Arbitrator_. Should any Arbitrator
refuse or be unable to proceed with arbitration proceedings as called for by
this _Section 2.3(c)_, such Arbitrator shall be replaced in the same
manner by which he or she was appointed (e.g., if a party appointed the
departing Arbitrator, that party would appoint the departing Arbitrators
replacement, and if the two Party-appointed Arbitrators appointed the
departing Arbitrator, then such party-appointed Arbitrators would appoint the
departing Arbitrators replacement). 
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | _Confidentiality_. To the fullest extent permitted by the
Laws of the State of Texas, the arbitration proceedings and award shall be
maintained in confidence by the parties. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (x) | _Expenses_. The Arbitrators shall have the authority to
award attorneys fees and expenses to the prevailing party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (xi) | THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT IN
ENTERING INTO THIS _SECTION 2.3(C)_ , THEY ARE KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY
WAIVING THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. 
---|---|--- 
 



-12- 2.4 _Transfer Taxes_. To the extent that any sales, use, transfer, purchase,
filing, recordation, stamp, registration and similar Taxes (collectively, "
_Transfer Taxes_ ") are payable as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, such Transfer Taxes shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by
Rice and fifty percent (50%) by the Partnership. To the extent under
applicable Law the transferee is responsible for filing Tax Returns or other
documentation in respect of Transfer Taxes, the Partnership shall prepare and
file all such Tax Returns or other documentation. The Parties shall provide
such certificates and other information and otherwise cooperate in good faith
to minimize, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, any Transfer Taxes.
The Party that is not responsible under applicable Law for paying the
Transfer Taxes shall pay its share of the Transfer Taxes to the responsible

Period ending on and including the Effective Date and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Effective Date in proportion to the
number of days in each period. __

construct any Water Treatment Asset in the Service Areas from the date hereof
until December 31, 2025; provided, however, that if Rice notifies the
Partnership of its desire to construct any Water Treatment Asset (the "
_Requested Asset_ ") in the Service Areas, the Partnership shall inform Rice
in writing within 30 days of receipt of such notice whether the Partnership
desires to construct the Water Treatment Asset. If the Partnership declines to

(b) In the event Rice or any of its Controlled Affiliates acquires any Water
Treatment Asset in the Service Areas from the date hereof until December 31,

including Rices out-of-pocket transaction costs related to such acquisition.
Rice or its applicable Controlled Affiliate will transfer valid title to any
such purchased Water Treatment Assets free and clear of any Liens other than
Permitted Liens and subject to customary terms and conditions.

Treatment Asset pursuant to this _Section 5.9_ and Rice notifies the
Partnership of its desire to receive the services of such Water Treatment
Asset, the Partnership and Rice shall negotiate the applicable fees and any
other terms of any service related thereto in good faith

Partnership shall indemnify and hold Rice and its Affiliates and their
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives (together with
Rice, the " _Rice Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against any and
all damages, losses, deficiencies, costs, expenses, obligations, fines,
expenditures, claims and liabilities, including court costs and reasonable
attorneys, accountants or other experts fees and reasonable expenses of
investigation, defending and prosecuting Litigation (collectively, the "
_Damages_ "), suffered by the Rice Indemnitees as a result of, caused by,
arising out of, or in any way relating to (a) any breach, violation or
inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the Partnership in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto (except for with
respect to _Section 3.13(a)_, without regard to qualifications as to
materiality or Rice Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications
contained therein), or (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant under this
Agreement on the part of the Partnership.

 

8.2 _Indemnification of the Partnership and Other Parties_. From and after the
Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this  _Article VIII_ , Rice
shall indemnify and hold the General Partner, the members of the Partnership
Group and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives (together with the Partnership, the "
_Partnership Indemnitees_ ") harmless from and against any and all Damages

or Partnership Material Adverse Effect or similar qualifications contained
therein), (b) any breach of any agreement or covenant in this Agreement on
the part of Rice or (c) the Rice Special Liabilities.

8.3 _Indemnification Procedures_.

(a) Each indemnified party agrees that promptly after it becomes aware of
facts giving rise to a claim by it for indemnification pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ by any third party with respect to any matter as to which it
claims to be entitled to indemnity under the provisions of this Agreement,
such indemnified party must assert its claim for indemnification under this
_Article VIII_ (each, an " _Indemnity Claim_ ") by providing a written notice
(a " _Claim Notice_ ") to the indemnifying party allegedly required to provide
indemnification protection under this _Article VIII_ specifying, in
reasonable detail, the nature and basis for such Indemnity Claim ( _e.g._ ,

 



-35-  the underlying representation, warranty, covenant or agreement alleged to
have been breached). Such notice shall include a demand for indemnification
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an indemnified partys
failure to send or delay in sending a third party Claim Notice will not
relieve the indemnifying party from liability hereunder with respect to such
Indemnity Claim except to the extent the indemnifying party is prejudiced by
such failure or delay and except as is otherwise provided herein. Except as
specifically provided herein, each indemnified partys rights and remedies set
forth in this Agreement will survive the Closing.

 

(b) In the event of the assertion of any third-party Indemnity Claim for
which, by the terms hereof, an indemnified party seeks indemnification from
an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will have the right, at such
indemnifying partys expense, to assume the defense of same, including the
appointment and selection of counsel on behalf of the indemnified party so
long as such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party. If
the indemnifying party elects to assume the defense of any such third-party
Indemnity Claim, it shall within 20 business days of its receipt of the Claim
Notice notify the indemnified party in writing of its intent to do so. Any
such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the indemnifying
party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. The indemnifying party
will have the right to settle or compromise or take any corrective or
remediation action with respect to any such Indemnity Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the indemnifying party to
a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the indemnifying party.
The indemnified party will be entitled, at its own cost, to participate with
the indemnifying party in the defense of any such Indemnity Claim. If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of any such third-party Indemnity Claim
but fails to reasonably prosecute such Indemnity Claim, or if the
indemnifying party does not assume the defense of any such Indemnity Claim,
the indemnified party may assume control of such defense and in the event it
is determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in this _Article VIII_
that the Indemnity Claim was a matter for which the indemnifying party is
required to provide indemnification under the terms of this _Article VIII_ ,
the indemnifying party will bear the reasonable costs and expenses of such
defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses).

(c) If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified party agrees to
cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in contesting any third-
party Indemnity Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the
third-party Indemnity Claim, or any cross-complaint against any person, and
the indemnifying party will reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable
expenses incurred by it in so cooperating. At no cost or expense to the
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall reasonably cooperate with the
indemnified party and its counsel in contesting any third-party Indemnity
Claim.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnifying party will not be permitted to settle, compromise, take
any corrective or remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent
decree, in each case, that subjects the indemnified party to any injunctive or
other non-monetary relief or any criminal liability, requires an admission of
guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the indemnified party or imposes any
continuing obligation on or requires any payment from the indemnified party
without the indemnified partys prior written consent.

 



-36- 8.4 _Calculation and Payment of Damages_.

 

(a) In calculating amounts payable to an indemnified party for a claim for
indemnification hereunder, the amount of any indemnified Damages shall be
determined without duplication of any other Damages for which an
indemnification claim has been made or could be made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and shall be computed net of
(i) payments actually recovered under any insurance policy with respect to
such Damages or (ii) any prior or subsequent actual recovery from any Person
other than the applicable indemnifying party with respect to such Damages.

 

(b) The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by periodic payments
of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense,
within 10 days as and when reasonably specific bills are received or loss,
liability, claim, damage or expense is incurred and reasonable evidence
thereof is delivered.

 

8.5 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall any Party be liable pursuant to this _Article
VIII_ for punitive, special, indirect, consequential, remote, speculative or
lost profits damages of any kind or nature, regardless of the form of action
through which such damages are sought, except for any such damages for
fraud or recovered by any third party against an indemnified party in respect
of which such indemnified party would otherwise be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to the terms hereof.

 

8.6 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) To the extent the Partnership Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
for Damages pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, Rice shall not be liable for those
Damages unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds one percent of the
Consideration (the " _Deductible_ "), and then only to the extent of any such
excess; provided, however, that Rice shall not be liable for Damages pursuant
to _Section 8.2(a)_ that exceed, in the aggregate, fifteen percent of the
Consideration (the " _Cap_ ") less the Deductible.

 

(b) Notwithstanding clause (a) above, (i) to the extent the Partnership
Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for Damages for claims arising

liable for such Damages without regard to the Deductible or the Cap and (ii)
to the extent the Partnership Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for
Damages for claims arising from a breach, violation or inaccuracy of a Rice
Fundamental Representation, Rice shall be fully liable for such Damages
without regard to the Deductible or the Cap.

__(c) To the extent the Rice Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification for
Damages pursuant to  _Section 8.1(a)_, the Partnership shall not be liable
for those Damages unless the aggregate amount of Damages exceeds the
Deductible; _provided, however_ , that the Partnership shall not be liable for
Damages pursuant to  _Section 8.1(a)_ that exceed, in the aggregate, the Cap
less the Deductible. __

 



-37- (d) Notwithstanding clause (c) above, (i) to the extent the Rice Indemnitees
are entitled to indemnification for Damages for claims arising from fraud,
the Partnership shall be fully liable for such Damages without regard to the
Deductible or the Cap and (ii) to the extent the Rice Indemnitees are entitled
to indemnification for Damages for claims arising from a breach, violation or
inaccuracy of a Partnership Fundamental Representation, the Partnership shall
be fully liable for such Damages without regard to the Deductible or the Cap.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if (x) the
Partnership obtains knowledge of the breach or violation of, or inaccuracy
with respect to, any representation or warranty of Rice under this Agreement
(regardless of whether such knowledge is obtained by inspection or
investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Partnership or its directors,
officers, employees, or representatives at any time and regardless of whether
notice of such knowledge has been given to Rice), and nonetheless proceeds to
the Closing, the Partnership shall not be deemed to have waived any rights and
remedies set forth in this Agreement with respect to such breach or
inaccuracy, or (y) Rice obtains knowledge of the breach or violation of, or
inaccuracy with respect to, any representation or warranty of the Partnership
under this Agreement (regardless of whether such knowledge is obtained by
inspection or investigation conducted by or on behalf of Rice or its
directors, officers, employees, or representatives at any time and regardless
of whether notice of such knowledge has been given to the Partnership), and
nonetheless proceeds to the Closing, Rice shall not be deemed to have waived
any rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement with respect to such
breach or inaccuracy.

 

8.7 _Survival_.

(a) The liability of Rice for the breach, violation or inaccuracy of any of
the representations and warranties of Rice set forth in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_
, _3.3(a)_ , _3.7_ , _3.10_ and _3.11_ (the " _Rice

indemnified party delivers written notice in reasonable detail to an
indemnifying party of a claim for indemnification on or prior to the
applicable expiration date for such claim, such claim shall survive until
finally resolved.

 

8.8 _Mitigation_. The Parties agree that an indemnified partys right to
recourse under this _Article VIII_ for any Damages shall be limited to the

applicable law or securities exchange regulations. 

10.5 _Form of Payment_. All payments hereunder shall be made in United States
dollars and, unless the Parties making and receiving such payments shall
agree otherwise or the provisions hereof provide otherwise, shall be made by
wire or interbank transfer of immediately available funds on the date such
payment is due to such account as the Party receiving payment may
designate at least three business days prior to the proposed date of payment.

 



-41- 10.6 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements specifically referred to
herein or delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits and schedules
hereto, (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior oral agreements and
understandings among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
(b) are not intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies
hereunder except as _Article VIII_ or  _Section 10.15_ contemplates or
except as otherwise expressly provided herein or therein. Each Party agrees
that (i) no other Party (including its agents and representatives) has made
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement to or with such Party
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than
those expressly set forth in the documents and instruments and other
agreements specifically referred to in _clause (i)_ above herein or
delivered pursuant hereto, including the exhibits and schedules hereto and
(ii) such Party has not relied upon any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby other than those referred to in clause (i) above. No amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless
executed in writing by the Parties. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of any of the Parties to comply with any obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition in this Agreement or any Transaction Document
may be waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefits thereof only by
a written instrument signed by the Party or Parties granting such waiver, but
such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 

10.7 _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, benefits or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, by any Party without the prior
written consent of the other Parties. Provided that the Partnership may
assign all or any of its rights and/or obligations (i) to a Subsidiary, (ii)
by way of a merger or consolidation or a sale of all or substantially all of
its assets, or (iii) pursuant to granting a Lien to financiers in a bona fide
lending transaction or in connection with any foreclosure, power of sale or
settlement thereof; provided no such assignment shall relieve the Partnership
of any of its obligations under this agreement.

 

10.8 _Severability_. If any provision of the Agreement is rendered or declared
illegal or unenforceable by reason of any existing or subsequently enacted
legislation or by decree of a court of last resort, the Parties shall meet
promptly and negotiate substitute provisions for those rendered or declared
illegal or unenforceable, but all of the remaining provisions of
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
or impaired in any way thereby.

 



-42- 10.9 _Interpretation_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that they have been represented by counsel during the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement and therefore waive
the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed
against the Party drafting such agreement or document.

 

(b) The words "this Agreement," "herein," "hereby," "hereunder" and "hereof,"
and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words "this
Article," "this Section" and "this clause," and words of similar import, refer
only to the Article, Section or clause hereof in which such words occur. The
word "or" is exclusive, and the word "including" (in its various forms) means
including without limitation.

 

(c) Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to
state and include any other gender, and words, terms and titles (including
terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the
plural and vice versa, unless the context otherwise requires.

 

(d) References herein to any Person shall include such Persons successors and
assigns; provided, however, that nothing contained in this clause (d) is
intended to authorize any assignment or transfer not otherwise permitted by
this Agreement.

(e) References herein to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as
amended, reenacted, supplemented or superseded in whole or in part and in
effect from time to time and also to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

 

(f) References herein to any Contract mean such Contract as amended,
supplemented or modified (including any waiver thereto) in accordance
with the terms thereof.

(g) Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement contained in this
Agreement will have independent significance, and the fact that any conduct
or state of facts may be within the scope of two or more provisions in this
Agreement, whether relating to the same or different subject matters and
regardless of the relative levels of specificity, shall not be considered in
construing or interpreting this Agreement.

(h) Unless otherwise expressly provided herein to the contrary,
accounting terms shall have the meaning given by GAAP.

10.10 _Headings and Schedules_. The headings of the several Articles and
Sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not
intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. The schedules referred to herein are attached hereto and
incorporated herein by this reference, and the matters disclosed in those
schedules shall be deemed to qualify the representation or warranty to which
they expressly relate and any other representation or warranty, but only to
the extent that it is readily apparent on its face that such disclosure is
applicable to such other representation or warranty. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that (a) the schedules may include certain items and information
solely for informational purposes for the convenience of the Parties and (b)
the disclosure by any Party of any matter in any schedule shall not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment by such Party that the matter is required to
be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

 



-43- 10.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, including electronic, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such
signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the Party executing
(or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect
as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original thereof.

10.12 _Determinations by the Partnership_. With respect to any notice,
consent, approval or waiver that is required to be or may be taken or given
by the Partnership (a) pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on or prior to
the Closing Date or (b) pursuant to _Article VIII_ after the Closing Date,
such notice, consent, approval or waiver shall be taken or given only by the
Conflicts Committee on behalf of the Partnership.

10.13 _Representation by Counsel_. Each Party agrees that it has been
represented by independent counsel of its choice during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and that it
has executed the same upon the advice of such independent counsel. Each
Party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this
Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts
relating thereto shall be deemed the work product of the Parties and may not
be construed against any Party by reason of its preparation. Therefore, the
Parties waive the application of any Law providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the Party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

10.14 _Disclosure Schedules_. The inclusion of any information (including
dollar amounts) in any schedule hereto shall not be deemed to be an admission
or acknowledgment by a Party that such information is required to be listed on
such schedule or is material to or outside the ordinary course of the business
of such Party or the Person to which such disclosure relates. The information
contained in this Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules is disclosed
solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained in this
Agreement, the Exhibits or the Schedules shall be deemed to be an admission by
any Party to any third Person of any matter whatsoever (including any
violation of a legal requirement or breach of contract). The disclosure
contained in any section of a disclosure schedule may be incorporated by
reference into any other disclosure schedule section contained therein, and
shall be deemed to have been so incorporated into any other disclosure
schedule section so long as it is readily apparent that the disclosure is
applicable to such other disclosure schedule.

 



-44- 10.15 _No Recourse Against Non-Parties_. All claims or causes of action that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as Parties. No Person who
is not a named Party to this Agreement, including any director, officer,
employee, member, partner (general or limited), securityholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or representative of any named Party to this Agreement ("
_Non-Party Affiliates_ "), shall have any liability (whether in contract or
in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks to impose
liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for any
obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related
to this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
this Agreement or its negotiation or execution; and each Party hereto waives
and releases all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such
Non-Party Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third-
party beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.
