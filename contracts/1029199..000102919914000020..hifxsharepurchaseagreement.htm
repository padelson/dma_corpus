The number of Escrow Shares (rounded downwards to the nearest whole number) to

the 20 trading days prior to the Completion Date provided that that the number
of Escrow Shares to be issued pursuant to this Clause 6.2 shall not in any
event exceed 19.9% of the total issued common stock of the Purchaser. If as a
result of the application of the foregoing proviso the total value to be
attributed to the Escrow Shares issued pursuant to this Clause 6.2 falls short
of £34,000,000 (thirty four million pounds sterling) (a "shortfall") the
Escrow Cash shall be increased by an amount equal to such shortfall.

At any time after Completion, the Vendors shall (and shall use their
reasonable endeavours to procure that any necessary third party shall) sign

Foreign Subsidiary the parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchaser (or

Subsidiary in advance of Completion in accordance with any election made
pursuant to Clause 8.1 ("Advance Monies"), the Warrantors shall ensure that
any such Advance Monies are strictly held and maintained in full by the
relevant Foreign Subsidiary pending Completion and the Warrantors shall
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement be liable to and shall
indemnify the Purchaser for any shortfall thereof at Completion. Further the
Purchaser and the Vendors\' Representatives undertake to each other to
negotiate in good faith to agree relevant processes and/or conditions for the
operation of the accounts of any Foreign Subsidiary that the Purchaser intends
to deposit Advance Monies in accordance with any election made pursuant to
Clause 8.1.

Subsidiaries, as if they had been expressly repeated with respect to each
Subsidiary, naming it in place of the Companies throughout, and references to
"Company" shall be to both "EIM" and "TBK". 

| 
---|--- 

10.5

|

Each of the Warranties shall be construed as a separate and independent
Warranty and shall not be governed, limited or restricted by reference to any
other term of this Agreement or any other Warranty (other than where expressly
provided to the contrary). 

|

10.6

|

The Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any rights which

for, or arising out of, a claim for breach or non-fulfilment of any of the
Warranties. 

| 
---|--- 

10.7

|

The rights and remedies of the Purchaser in respect of any breach of the
Warranties shall not be affected by completion of the purchase of the Shares,
by any investigation made by or on behalf of the Purchaser into the affairs of
the Group, by its rescinding or failure to rescind this Agreement, by any
failure to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy or by any other
event or matter whatsoever, except a specific and duly authorised written
waiver or release expressly referring to such breach. 

| 
---|--- 

10.8

|

Each of the Warrantors agrees with the Purchaser (for itself and as trustee
for each Group Company and their respective directors, officers and employees)
to waive any claim or remedy or right which they may have in respect of any
misrepresentation, inaccuracy or omission in or from any information or advice
supplied or given by any Group Company or a director, officer or employee of
any Group Company for the purpose of assisting the Warrantors in giving any
warranty, representation, undertaking or covenant, in preparing the Disclosure
Letter and in entering into this Agreement or any agreement or document
entered into pursuant to this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

10.9

|

If any amount payable to the Purchaser in respect of any Warranty or otherwise
pursuant to this Clause 10 is subject to Tax, that amount shall be increased
so as to ensure that the net amount received by the Purchaser shall, after
Tax, be equal to that which would have been received had the payment and any
increased payment not been subject to Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, any
such increase pursuant to this Clause 10.9 shall be included for the purposes
of determining any Warranty and Tax Undertaking limitations in Part 12 of the
Schedule. 

This Clause 10.9 shall not apply to increase the amount payable in respect of
any Warranty or otherwise pursuant to this Clause 10 if and to the extent
that:

|

the amount payable would not have been subject to Tax had the Purchaser been

Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement
or document entered into pursuant to this Agreement, none of the limitations
contained in this Clause 10, Part 12 of the Schedule, the Disclosure Letter

| 
---|--- 

10.10.2

|

Each of the Disclosed Pension Schemes: 

| 
---|--- 

16.3.1

|

is a registered pension scheme as defined in Section 150(2) of the Finance Act

| 
---|--- 

16.3.2

|

is and has always been managed in accordance with all applicable laws,
regulations and requirements including (without limitation to) trust law,
anti-discrimination law, pensions taxation law (including the Finance Act 2004

|

offers only benefits on the retirement, death, disability, illness or injury
of any of the any employee or officer of the Company that are fully funded or
insured with an insurance company of good repute for their full amount and on

All contributions, premiums, expenses and professional fees in respect of the
Disclosed Pension Schemes have been paid.

|

Apart from earnings related lump sum death benefits, the Disclosed Pension
Schemes provide only money purchase benefits (as defined in section 181 of the
Pension Schemes Act 1993) and the Company has not given any promise or
assurance to any beneficiary of the Disclosed Pension Schemes that his
benefits under the Disclosed Pension Schemes will be calculated wholly or
partly by reference to that person\'s remuneration or will be any particular
amount.

---|--- 

16.7

|

No current or former employee or officer of the Company whose employment
transferred to or has transferred to the Company under legislation or
regulations on the transfer of undertakings or otherwise was a member of or
entitled to be or become a member of any final salary or defined benefit

Over-provision, Understatement, Saving or Repayment, such disagreement may be
referred by either party to the auditors for the time being of the Group for

THE SCHEDULE - PART 12

Limitations

The following provisions shall apply to restrict and/or exclude the liability
of the Warrantors under the Warranties (other than the Tax Warranties) and
where specifically stated the liabilities of the Warrantors under the Tax
Undertaking and Tax Warranties. References in this Part to the Warranties
shall, unless otherwise specified, mean the Warranties other than the Tax
Warranties.

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

The Warrantors shall be under no liability whatsoever in respect of any breach
or non-fulfilment of any of the Warranties or Tax Warranties or in respect of
any claim under the Tax Undertaking, unless the Purchaser has served on the
Vendors' Representatives on or before: 

| 
---|--- 

1.1

|

the second anniversary of the Completion Date in the case of a claim other
than a claim under the Tax Warranties or Tax Undertaking; and 

| 
---|--- 

1.2

|

the seventh anniversary of the Completion Date in the case of a claim under
the Tax Warranties or Tax Undertaking. 

Such notice should give reasonable details of the claim, including the
Purchaser's best estimate of the amount of the liability of the Warrantors in
respect of such claim and should detail (based on the information then
available to the Purchaser) the Purchaser's calculation of the loss alleged to
have been suffered by it or its claim under the Tax Undertaking (provided that
any failure to provide such details in the notice shall not prejudice the
claim in question). Any such claim, other than a claim under the Tax
Warranties or Tax Undertaking, shall (if it has not been previously satisfied,
settled or withdrawn) be deemed to have been withdrawn, and all and any
liability of the Warrantors in respect of such claim shall be extinguished,
unless proceedings in respect of such claim have commenced by a writ being
served on the Warrantors within six months after the second anniversary of the
Completion Date.

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any claim for damages in
respect of breach or non-fulfilment of any of the Warranties (including the
Tax Warranties) (subject as hereafter provided in this subclause) unless and
until: 

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

the amount of such claim, or series of claims arising from the same facts or
circumstances such that they should reasonably be regarded as related claims,
(or if when any such claim is agreed, settled or otherwise determined it is at
a lower amount than the amount of the Purchaser's claim, such lower amount)
exceeds £50,000 (fifty thousand pounds sterling); and 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

88


| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

the aggregate amount of all valid claims qualifying under paragraph 2.1 (or,
if when such claims are agreed, settled or otherwise determined, the aggregate
amount is at a lower amount than the amounts of the Purchaser's original
claims, such lower amount) exceeds £500,000 (five hundred thousand pounds
sterling); 

in which event the Warrantors shall be liable for the full amount agreed,
settled or otherwise determined and not merely the excess over £500,000 (five
hundred thousand pounds sterling).

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

For determining whether the amount of a claim (or the aggregate amount of
claims (if applicable)) exceeds the threshold of £50,000 in paragraph 2.1
and/or the threshold of £500,000 in paragraph 2.2: 

| 
---|--- 

3.1

|

any interest, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, advisers'
fees) claimed by the Purchaser as part of its claim under the Warranties
(including the Tax Warranties) shall be excluded; and 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

|

the amount of the claim is the amount as reduced by the application of the
provisions of this part of the Schedule. 

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Subject to paragraph 6 below, the aggregate liability of all of the Warrantors
in respect of any and all claims for damages under or in respect of breach or
non-fulfilment of any of the Warranties, Tax Warranties and/or any claim under
the Tax Undertaking (together referred to as "General Claims") shall be
limited to £43,500,000 (forty three million five hundred thousand pounds
sterling). 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Subject to paragraph 6 below, the liability of each of the Warrantors in
respect of any and all such General Claims shall be limited to that
Warrantor's Percentage of the amount due after the claim is agreed, settled or
otherwise determined, provided that no Warrantor shall be liable for an amount
in excess of his relevant share as follows:

|

The limitations set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 above shall not apply to or
seek to limit the liability of the Warrantors for any General Claim for a
breach of the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Warranties, or any breach by the
Warrantors of the Title Warranties. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

The Warrantors shall be under no liability whatsoever in respect of any claim,
whether in relation to a Warranty, Tax Warranty or Tax Undertaking, where the
amount of the claim arises, directly or indirectly, from any step taken
pursuant to Clause 8 (Purchase of Foreign Subsidiaries). 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

The Warrantors shall be under no liability whatsoever in respect of any breach
or non-fulfilment of the Warranties if and to the extent that: 

| 
---|--- 

8.1

|

any specific allowance, provision or reserve is made or otherwise specifically
noted in the Accounts, Management Accounts or Net Assets Statement; or 

| 
---|--- 

8.2

|

the claim would not have arisen but for an alteration or enactment (other than
a re‑enactment) of any statute, statutory instrument or regulation or other
legislative or regulatory act or imposition or any change in or withdrawal of
the requirements or published practice or extra statutory concession of a
Taxation Authority which change or withdrawal was announced or enacted or
imposed or became effective on or after the date of this Agreement (whether
relating to taxation, rates of taxation, the reduction of allowances or
reliefs or otherwise), whether with or without retrospective effect, or any
judgement delivered after the date of this Agreement; or 

| 
---|--- 

8.3

|

the claim arises as a result of any changes on or after the Completion Date in
the accounting or taxation policies or practices of the Group, including,
without limitation, the policies and practices in terms of which the Group
values its assets, makes provisions or recognises liabilities; or 

| 
---|--- 

8.4

|

the claim arises as a result of any act, matter or thing which has been done
or omitted to be done prior to Completion at the written request of or with
the prior written approval of the Purchaser; or 

| 
---|--- 

8.5

|

the claim would not have arisen but for, or is increased as a result of, any
voluntary act, omission or transaction of the Purchaser or any Purchaser's
Group Company or any person deriving title from a Purchaser's Group Company or
any party acting on behalf of, or on the instructions of, any such party on or
after Completion other than in the ordinary course of the business of the
relevant Group Company as carried on prior to Completion (other than matters
which are required pursuant to any contractual arrangements in existence prior
to Completion); or 

| 
---|--- 

8.6

|

the loss in respect of which the claim is made is reimbursed under a policy of
insurance or any other similar form of insurance, guarantee or other cover
from whatever source; or 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

90


| 
---|--- 

8.7

|

the liability is a contingent liability, unless and until such contingent
liability becomes an actual liability and is discharged. 

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

The liability of the Warrantors shall not be increased by reason of the fact
that any claim in respect of any one matter or default is made or is capable
of being made in respect of more than one of the Warranties (including the Tax
Warranties) or under the Warranties (including the Tax Warranties) and the Tax
Undertaking. 

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

The Warrantors shall be under no liability in respect of any breach or non-
fulfilment of the Warranties (including the Tax Warranties) if and to the
extent that the loss occasioned thereby has been recovered under any other
Warranty or other provision of this Agreement (including without limitation,
the Tax Undertaking) and vice versa. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

The Purchaser shall notify the Vendors' Representatives as soon as reasonably
practicable in writing upon becoming actually aware of any fact, matter or
other circumstance whereby the Warrantors may be liable to make payment under
or by virtue of the Warranties (other than the Tax Warranties, to which the
provisions of paragraph 7 of the Tax Undertaking shall instead apply) (such
fact, matter or other circumstance being referred to in this paragraph 7 as a
"Potential Claim"). The Purchaser shall consult with the Vendors'
Representatives with respect to any possible mitigating action or defence to
the matter giving rise to the Potential Claim or any possible right of
recovery against a third party in respect of such matter. Subject to the
Purchaser and the relevant Purchaser's Group Company being entitled to employ
its own legal advisers and being indemnified and secured to its reasonable
satisfaction by the Warrantors against all costs, expenses, damages and losses
(including, without limitation, the reasonable and proper costs of its legal
advisers) incurred by the Company in taking such action, the Purchaser shall
take, and shall procure that each Purchaser\'s Group Company shall take, all
reasonable steps so as to recover or minimise or resolve such liability or
dispute. The Vendors' Representatives shall ensure that the Purchaser is kept
promptly informed of any actual or proposed developments in the Potential
Claim which are or may reasonably be considered to be material, including
providing the Purchaser with copies of all material correspondence and
documentation relating to the Potential Claim. Provided that nothing in this
paragraph 11 shall require the Purchaser or any Purchaser's Group Company to
take or refrain from taking any action which it reasonably considers would
materially and adversely affect the goodwill or bona fide commercial interests
of the Purchaser's Group. 

| 
---|--- 

12.

|

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claim in respect of any
alleged breach or non-fulfilment of any of the Warranties (including the Tax
Warranties) to the extent that the subject of 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

91



the claim has been made good or otherwise compensated for without cost or
expense (other than management time) to the Purchaser's Group Company.

| 
---|--- 

13.

|

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover any sums under the Warranties
(including the Tax Warranties) or under the Tax Undertaking to the extent that
any Purchaser's Group Company has, after the date of this Agreement, expressly
waived in writing its rights to make or pursue a claim against the Warrantors. 

| 
---|--- 

14.

|

Neither any of the Warranties (including the Tax Warranties) nor any other
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to be breached by, nor shall any
claim arise in respect of, any matter expressly provided for under the terms
of this Agreement or anything which was done or carried out in implementing
the terms of this Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

15.

|

If any of the Warrantors pay to the Purchaser an amount in respect of a claim
under the Warranties and the Purchaser's Group subsequently recovers from a
third party (including, without limitation, any Taxation Authority) (whether
by way of payment, discount, credit, set-off or otherwise) an amount which is
referable to the matter giving rise to the claim, then: 

| 
---|--- 

15.1

|

if the amount paid by the Warrantors in respect of the claim under the
Warranties is more than the Sum Recovered, the Purchaser shall pay, or shall
procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser's Group shall pay, to each
Warrantor forthwith an amount representing that Warrantor's Percentage of the
Sum Recovered; and 

| 
---|--- 

15.2

|

if the amount paid by the Warrantors in respect of the claim under the
Warranties is less than or equal to the Sum Recovered, the Purchaser shall
pay, or shall procure that the relevant member of the Purchaser's Group shall
pay, to each Warrantor forthwith an amount representing that Warrantor's
Percentage of the amount paid by the Warrantors. 

For the purposes of this paragraph 15 "Sum Recovered" means the amount
(including interest) recovered from the third party less all reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by the Purchaser's Group in recovering the amount from
the third party.

| 
---|--- 

16.

|

Any amount paid by the Warrantors or the Vendors to the Purchaser in respect
of a breach of the Warranties, the Tax Warranties or under the Tax Undertaking
shall be treated as a reduction in the Consideration payable to the Warrantors
hereunder. 

| 
---|--- 

17.

|

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall in any way
restrict or limit the general obligation at law of the Purchaser and/or the
Purchaser's Group Companies to mitigate any loss or damage which they may
respectively suffer in consequence of any breach or non-fulfilment of the 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

92



Warranties (including the Tax Warranties) and the Purchaser undertakes to
take, and procure that each relevant member of the Purchaser's Group takes,
all reasonable steps (to the extent that it is lawful to do so) to mitigate
their loss or damage in consequence of any matter giving rise to a claim under
the Warranties, the Tax Warranties or under the Tax Undertaking and, in
respect of a claim under the Tax Warranties or the Tax Undertaking, all
reasonable rights of appeal.

| 
---|--- 

18.

|

None of the Warranties other than the Tax Warranties shall be deemed to
constitute, directly or indirectly, a warranty in relation to taxation and the
Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the Warrantors make no warranties in
relation to taxation save as expressly provided in those paragraphs. 

| 
---|--- 

19.

|

The Purchaser confirms and warrants to the Warrantors that there are no
circumstances (save as fairly disclosed in the Disclosure Letter) within the
actual knowledge of the Purchaser at the date of this Agreement which will
entitle the Purchaser to make a claim under the Warranties. For the purposes
of this paragraph 19, the Purchaser shall be deemed only to be aware of
anything which Mike Martens, Juan Bianchi and/or Jeff Newman are actually
aware.

|

DEFINITIONS 

For the purposes of this Part 14 of the Schedule:

"Agreed Claim" means a Claim to the extent that it has been:

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

agreed by the Vendors' Representatives to be payable by any of the Warrantors;
or 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the subject of an award or judgment in favour of the Purchaser by a Court or
tribunal of competent jurisdiction from which there is no appeal or from which
no appeal has been lodged within the period permitted for any appeal. 

"Claim" means any claim made by the Purchaser against the Warrantors under
this Agreement including, without limitation, under the Warranties, Tax
Warranties, Tax Undertaking, Clause 8.2, Clause 13 (Specific Indemnities) or
Part 15 of the Schedule.

"Escrow Release Date" means the second anniversary of the Completion Date (or
the first Business Day after such date if that day is not a Business Day).

2 ESCROW SHARES AND ESCROW CASH

| 
---|--- 

2.1

|

On the Completion Date, the Purchaser shall pay £9,500,000 (nine million five
hundred thousand pounds sterling) (being the Escrow Cash) to the Escrow Agent
to hold as trustee for the Purchaser. The Escrow Agent shall deposit the
Escrow Cash in an interest bearing account (£) as agreed between the Purchaser
and the Vendors' Representatives. The Escrow Deed shall provide that the
Escrow Agent will not transfer the Escrow Cash other than on the joint
instructions of the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representatives. 

| 
---|--- 

2.2

|

As soon as reasonably practicable after Completion (being not more than five
Business Days following Completion) the Purchaser shall issue the Escrow
Shares and provide the share certificate for such Escrow Shares to the Escrow
Agent to hold as trustee for the Purchaser and the Warrantors to be governed
by the terms of the Escrow Deed. The Escrow Deed shall provide that the Escrow
Agent will not transfer the Escrow Shares other than on the joint instructions
of the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representatives. 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

95


| 
---|--- 

2.3

|

Forthwith after a Claim becomes an Agreed Claim, the Purchaser and the
Vendors' Representatives must direct the Escrow Agent to transfer to the
Purchaser (or as otherwise directed by the Purchaser) an amount of Escrow
Shares equal to the value of each Agreed Claim, to the extent that such Agreed
Claim has not been otherwise satisfied by the Warrantors. For the avoidance of
doubt, this direction is required to be given at such time as an Agreed Claim
is agreed or determined, which can be prior to the Escrow Release Date. If the
value of the Escrow Shares is not sufficient to meet the value of an Agreed
Claim, the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representatives must direct the Escrow
Agent to transfer to the Purchaser (or as otherwise directed by the Purchaser)
an amount of Escrow Cash such that the value of the Escrow Shares and/or
Escrow Cash is equal to the value of the Agreed Claim, to the extent that such
Agreement Claim has not been otherwise satisfied by the Warrantors. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Escrow Cash shall be utilised towards an Agreed Claim
unless and until there are no Escrow Shares available to meet the Agreed
Claim. 

| 
---|--- 

2.4

|

Subject to paragraph 2.5, the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representatives must
direct the Escrow Agent to transfer legal ownership of all remaining Escrow
Shares (if any) and all remaining Escrow Cash (if any), plus any and all
interest accrued thereon, to the Warrantors on the basis of their respective
share of the Escrow Amount as set forth in Part 13 of the Schedule (with any
such deductions made as a result of Claims), or as otherwise directed by the
Vendors' Representatives, on the Escrow Release Date. 

| 
---|--- 

2.5

|

If, at any time before the Escrow Release Date, the Purchaser has notified any
Claim(s) in writing to the Vendors' Representatives which have not become
Agreed Claims (the "Disputed Claims"), the Purchaser and the Vendors'
Representatives must direct the Escrow Agent to retain an amount of Escrow
Shares and Escrow Cash (only to the extent that the amount of Escrow Shares is
insufficient) equal to the aggregate amount of such Disputed Claims plus all
interest accrued on such aggregate amount since the Completion Date (except to
the extent that such Disputed Claims have become Agreed Claims and an amount
of Escrow Shares and/or Escrow Cash equal to the value of such Disputed Claims
have been transferred to the Purchaser (or as otherwise directed by the
Purchaser) before the Escrow Release Date) and the legal ownership of the
balance (if any) of the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Cash shall be transferred
to the Warrantors on the basis of their respective share of the Escrow Amount
as set forth in Part 13 of the Schedule (with any such deductions made as a
result of Claims), or as otherwise directed by the Vendors' Representatives,
on the Escrow Release Date. 

| 
---|--- 

2.6

|

Forthwith after agreement or determination of all Disputed Claims (if any) but
subject always to paragraph 2.3, the Purchaser and the Vendors'
Representatives must direct the Escrow Agent to transfer legal ownership of
the balance (if any) of the Escrow Shares and the Escrow Cash to the
Warrantors on the basis of their respective share of the Escrow Amount as set
forth in Part 13 of the Schedule 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

(with any such deductions made as a result of Claims), or as otherwise
directed by the Vendors' Representatives, on the Escrow Release Date.

|

MISCELLANEOUS 

| 
---|--- 

3.1

|

For the purposes of this Part 14 of the Schedule a Claim will be deemed to
have been withdrawn unless proceedings in respect of such Claim have been
commenced within the requisite time frame from the date on which the Claim is
notified to the Vendors' Representatives as provided for in Part 12 of the
Schedule. 

| 
---|--- 

3.2

|

The transfer of any Escrow Shares and Escrow Cash to the Purchaser pursuant to
this Part 14 of the Schedule in or towards satisfaction of any Claim shall in
no way prejudice or affect any other rights or remedies the Purchaser may have
in relation to the recovery of any amount due to it pursuant to this
Agreement. 

| 
---|--- 

3.3

|

For the purposes of this Part 14 of the Schedule: 

| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

the value to be attributed to each Escrow Share will be the value per share
equal to the average closing price (converted at the Exchange Rate) of common
stock of the Purchaser on the NASDAQ stock market for the 20 trading days
prior to the following date: 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

where a Claim is an Agreed Claim, the date of that agreement or determination;
or 

| 
---|--- 

(ii)

|

the date that a calculation is required to be made pursuant to this Part 14 of
the Schedule; or 

| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

in all other cases, the Escrow Release Date; 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

the number of Escrow Shares required to be transferred to the Purchaser or the
Warrantors shall (where necessary) be rounded downwards to the nearest whole
number. 

| 
---|--- 

3.4

|

The Purchaser and the Warrantors agree that the economic benefit (for example
dividends) accruing to any of the Escrow Shares from the Completion Date to
the Escrow Release Date (the "Economic Benefit") must be paid to the Escrow
Agent, which must as soon as reasonably practicable invest such Economic
Benefit in an interest bearing account (£) as agreed between the Purchaser and
the Vendors' Representatives. The Purchaser or a Warrantor (as the case may
be) entitled to the transfer of an Escrow Share will be entitled to receive
the principal amount of the Economic Benefit (if any) in relation to that
Escrow Share and any and all accrued interest or other return on and
attributable to that Economic Benefit, less its proportionate share of any
fees or charges charged in relation to the escrow arrangements or the interest
bearing account.

|

The Purchaser and the Warrantors agree that unless and until the Escrow Shares
are subject to an Agreed Claim or have been transferred to either the
Purchaser (or otherwise as directed by the Purchaser) or the Warrantors in
accordance with this Part 14 of the Schedule, the Escrow Agent must exercise
any voting or other non-economic rights in relation to those Escrow Shares in
accordance with the instructions of the Vendors' Representatives.

discussions in good faith with a view to agreeing any particular item in
relation to the Draft Statement the amount and nature of which has been
specified by the Vendors\' Representatives in accordance with paragraph 5 of
this Part 15 of the Schedule. If such agreement is reached and is confirmed in
writing by the Vendors' Representatives and the Purchaser, it shall be
conclusive, final and binding on the parties but without prejudice to the
Purchaser\'s right to claim under the Warranties, Tax Warranties, Tax
Undertaking or otherwise in respect of any matter.

Any dispute about the Draft Statement which remains unresolved 30 Business
Days after receipt by the Vendors' Representatives of the Draft Statement
shall, at the request of either the Purchaser or the Vendors' Representatives,
be referred for final determination to an independent firm of chartered
accountants nominated jointly by the Purchaser and the Vendors'
Representatives or, failing such nomination within 10 Business Days after a
request by either the Purchaser or the Vendors' Representatives, such firm
shall be nominated at the request of either the Purchaser or the Vendors'
Representatives by the President for the time being of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Such independent firm shall act as
experts and not as arbitrators and (in the absence of manifest error) its
decisions (both as to the manner in which its determination is to be made and
as to the subject matter of its determination) shall be conclusive, final and
binding on the parties but

shall be without prejudice to the Purchaser's right to claim under the
Warranties, Tax Warranties, Tax Undertaking or otherwise in respect of any
matter. The fees of such independent firm shall be payable by the Purchaser
and the Vendors in such proportions as such independent firm determines (or
failing such determination equally by the Vendors on the one hand and the
Purchaser on the other hand).

Each of the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representatives will co-operate fully
with the other and, if applicable, with the independent firm appointed under
paragraph 8 of this Part 15 of the Schedule (including giving all reasonable
access to records, information, and to personnel) with a view to enabling the
Draft Statement to be prepared and subsequently discussed and, if applicable,
with a view to enabling any such independent firm to make any determination
required by paragraph 8 of this Part 15 of the Schedule, and, in particular,
the Purchaser shall procure that the Group shall permit the Vendors'
Representatives and their advisers (and, if applicable, such independent firm)
to have reasonable access to, and (where reasonable) to take copies of any
records or information belonging to the Group which the Vendors'
Representatives may reasonably require for the purpose of reviewing the Draft
Statement.

THE SCHEDULE - PART 17

Provisions Regarding the Issue of the Escrow Shares



Section A

Method of Registration of Escrow Shares

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 

The Purchaser shall:

| 
---|--- 

1.1.1

|

subject to the receipt of necessary information as provided in Section 1.1.15
below in a timely manner from each Warrantor, prepare and file with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), not later than 30 days
after the date Escrow Shares are released to the Warrantors from Escrow (the
"Escrow Release Date"), a registration statement on Form S-3 (or, in the event
the Purchaser is not eligible to use Form S-3, such other registration form as
may be utilized at such time by the Purchaser) (the "Registration Statement")
to enable the resale of the Escrow Shares (the "Registrable Shares") (which
term shall include any securities into which or for which such shares may
hereafter be changed, converted or exchanged, and any other shares or
securities issued with respect to such shares to each Warrantor) by each
Warrantor from time to time through the automated quotation system of the
NASDAQ Global Securities Market (or such other national securities exchange or
inter-dealer quotation system of a national securities association in the
United States on which the Escrow Shares are then principally traded) or in
privately negotiated transactions (and excluding for the avoidance of doubt
any underwritten public offerings); provided that the Company shall not be
required to file a Registration Statement under this Section 1.1.1 for any
Warrantor if such Warrantor may sell all Registrable Shares then held by it,
him or her without the requirement for the Purchaser to be in compliance with
the current public information requirements under Rule 144(c)(1) under the
Securities Act and without volume or manner of sale restrictions; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.2

|

use its commercially reasonable efforts, subject to the receipt of necessary
information from each Warrantor as provided in Section 1.1.15 below, to cause
the Registration Statement to be declared effective under the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the "Securities Act"), as soon as practicable but in
any event on or prior to the date which is 90 days after the Escrow Release
Date or, in the event the SEC reviews and has written comments with respect to
the Registration Statement, 120 days after the Escrow Release Date; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.3

|

(a) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith (the
"Prospectus") as may be necessary to keep the Registration Statement current
(other than during any Blackout Period (as defined below)) and effective for a 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

103



period not exceeding, with respect to each Warrantor's Registrable Shares, the
earlier of (i) the date on which such Warrantor may sell all Registrable
Shares then held by it, him or her without the requirement for the Purchaser
to be in compliance with the current public information requirements under
Rule 144(c)(1) under the Securities Act and without volume or manner of sale
restrictions, or (ii) such time as all Registrable Shares issued to such
Warrantor have been sold pursuant to the Registration Statement (the
"Effectiveness Period");

| 
---|--- 

1.1.4

|

respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from
the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.5

|

not less than five Business Days prior to the filing of the Registration
Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,
furnish to each Warrantor copies of the "Selling Security Holders" section of
such documents in the form in which the Purchaser proposes to file them, which
sections will be subject to the review of each such Warrantor. Each Warrantor
shall provide comments, if any, within three Business Days after the date such
materials are provided and the Purchaser shall make appropriate revisions to
the "Selling Security Holders" section based upon comments received; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.6

|

furnish to each Warrantor with respect to the Registrable Shares registered
under the Registration Statement such number of copies of the Registration
Statement, Prospectus and such other documents as such Warrantor may
reasonably request, in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of all or any of the Registrable Shares by each Warrantor to the
extent delivery of any such documents is required under applicable law. The
Purchaser hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto by each of the Warrantors in connection with the offering
and sale of the Registrable Shares covered by such Prospectus and any
amendment or supplement thereto in accordance with the provisions hereof; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.7

|

use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) register or qualify the
Registrable Shares to be included in the Registration Statement under such
other securities laws or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions in the United
States as each Warrantor shall reasonably request, (ii) keep such
registrations or qualifications in effect during the Effectiveness Period and
(iii) take any and all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable each Warrantor to consummate the disposition in such
jurisdictions of such Registrable Shares; provided, however, that the
Purchaser shall not be required for any such purpose to (x) qualify generally
to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would
not otherwise be required to qualify but for the requirements of this Section
1.1.7, (y) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (z) consent
to general service of process in any such jurisdiction; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.8

|

promptly notify a Warrantor and (if requested by such Warrantor) confirm such
advice in writing (i) when the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any
Prospectus Supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, (ii) with
respect to the Registration Statement or any post effective amendment, when
the same has become effective, and (iii) when the SEC notifies the Purchaser 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

104



whether it will be reviewing and providing comments with respect to the
Registration Statement or any amendment thereto;

| 
---|--- 

1.1.9

|

use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued,
obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the qualification (or
exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable Shares for sale in any
jurisdiction, as soon as practicable; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.10

|

cooperate with the Warrantors to facilitate the timely preparation and
delivery of either certificates or a book entry position Registrable Shares to
be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the Registration Statement, which
certificates shall be free of all restrictive legends, and to enable such
Registrable Shares to be in such denominations and registered in such names as
any such Warrantors may reasonably request. 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.11

|

list all such Registrable Shares on the principal securities exchange or
automated inter-dealer quotation system in the United States on which such
Registrable Shares are then listed or admitted for trading; 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.12

|

use its commercially reasonable efforts to comply with all applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC, and make available to its security holders, as
soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement covering a period of at
least twelve (12) months, beginning after the effective date of the
Registration Statement, which earning statement shall satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, including Rule 158 promulgated
thereunder; and 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.13

|

pay all expenses incident to the Purchaser's performance or compliance
herewith, including, without limitation, all SEC and any Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority registration and filing fees and expenses, fees and
expenses of compliance with securities and blue sky laws, document preparation
and printing expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, fees and expenses of
any escrow agent or custodian, internal expenses (including, without
limitation, all salaries and expenses of the Purchaser's officers and
employees performing legal or accounting duties), expenses incurred in
connection with the listing of the Registrable Shares on any securities
exchange or quotation system as required hereunder, fees and disbursements of
counsel and independent certified public accountants of the Purchaser
(including the expenses of any special audit or "comfort" letters required by
or incident to such performance and compliance), and fees and expenses of any
other persons, including special experts, retained by the Purchaser; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, each Warrantor shall pay all
discounts or commissions to any broker attributable to the sale of Registrable
Shares and the fees and disbursements of any counsel, advisors or experts
retained by such Warrantor. 

| 
---|--- 

1.1.14

|

With a view to making available to each Warrantor the benefits of Rule 144 of
the Securities Act (or its successor rule) (the "Rule 144") and any other rule
or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit each Warrantor to sell
Registrable Shares to the public without registration, the Purchaser covenants 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

105



and agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts during the Effectiveness
Period to: (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144; and (ii) file with the SEC in a timely
manner all reports and other documents required of the Purchaser under the
United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")
(at any time that the Purchaser is subject to such reporting requirements).

| 
---|--- 

1.1.15

|

It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of the Purchaser to take
any action pursuant to this Section 1.1 that each Warrantor shall furnish to
the Purchaser such information regarding itself, himself or herself, the
Registrable Shares to be sold by such Warrantor, and the intended method of
disposition of such securities as shall be required to effect the registration
of the Registrable Shares. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2

|

TRANSFER OF ESCROW SHARES AFTER REGISTRATION; SUSPENSIONS; BLACKOUTS 

| 
---|--- 

1.2.1

|

Each Warrantor agrees that such Warrantor will not make any sale or other
transfer of the Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement
except as contemplated in Section 1.1 and as described below, and that such
Warrantor will promptly notify the Purchaser of any changes in the information
set forth in the Registration Statement regarding such Warrantor. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2.2

|

Except in the event that Sections 1.2.3 or 1.2.4 below apply, the Purchaser
shall, if deemed necessary by the Purchaser, prepare and file as soon as
reasonably practicable from time to time with the SEC a post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the related
Prospectus or a supplement or amendment to any document incorporated therein
by reference or file any other required document so that such Registration
Statement will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and so that, as thereafter delivered or
deemed delivered to purchasers of the Registrable Shares being sold there
under, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2.3

|

Subject to Section 1.2.4 below, in the event: (i) of any request by the SEC or
any other federal or state governmental authority of the United States of
America during the period of effectiveness of the Registration Statement for
amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or related Prospectus
or for additional information; (ii) of the issuance by the SEC or any other
federal or state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose; (iii) of the receipt by the Purchaser of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Registrable Shares for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation of any proceeding for such purpose; or (iv) of
any event or circumstance which in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Purchaser necessitates the making of any changes in 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

106



the Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, so that, in the case of the
Registration Statement, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and that in the case
of the Prospectus, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or any omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading; then the Purchaser shall deliver a
document in writing to each Warrantor (the "Suspension Notice") to the effect
of the foregoing and, upon receipt of such Suspension Notice, each Warrantor
will suspend offers and sales of Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement (the "Suspension") until such Warrantor receives copies
of a supplemented or amended Prospectus prepared and filed by the Purchaser,
or until such Warrantor is advised in writing by the Purchaser that the
current Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in any such Prospectus. In the event of any Suspension, the Purchaser will use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the use of the Prospectus so
suspended to be resumed as soon as reasonably practicable after delivery of a
Suspension Notice to each Warrantor.

| 
---|--- 

1.2.4

|

If at any time the Purchaser sends a Suspension Notice to each Warrantor and
the Purchaser also notifies each Warrantor that the event giving rise to such
notice relates to a development involving the Purchaser and that the Purchaser
has determined in its reasonable good faith judgment that disclosure of such
development at such time would be materially detrimental to the Purchaser and
its subsidiaries, then the Purchaser shall not be required to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make any changes to the Registration
Statement or Prospectus, or any document incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated therein by reference, during a period of up to 60 consecutive
days as specified in the notice contemplated herein (the "Blackout Period"),
and each Warrantor shall suspend offers and sales of Registrable Shares
pursuant to the Registration Statement during each Blackout Period; provided,
however, that in any period of 365 consecutive days the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to avail itself of its rights under this Section 1.2.4 with respect
to more than two Blackout Periods. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2.5

|

Provided that a Suspension or a Blackout Period is not then in effect, subject
to the terms and conditions of this Section 1.1 each Warrantor may sell
Registrable Shares under the Registration Statement, provided that each
Warrantor arranges for delivery of a current Prospectus to the transferee of
such Registrable Shares to the extent required by applicable law. Upon receipt
of a request therefor, the Purchaser agrees to provide an adequate number of
current Prospectuses to each Warrantor and to supply copies to any other
parties requiring such Prospectuses. 

| 
---|--- 

1.2.6

|

In the event of a sale of Registrable Shares by a Warrantor, such Warrantor
shall also deliver to the Purchaser's transfer agent, with a copy to the
Purchaser, a notice of such sale so that the Registrable Shares may be
properly transferred.

107


| 
---|--- 

1.3.1

|

Upon the registration of the Registrable Shares pursuant to Section 1.1, the
Purchaser shall, and it hereby agrees to, indemnify and hold harmless each
Warrantor, the directors and officers and partners of such Warrantor and each
other person, if any, who controls such Warrantor within the meaning of the
Securities Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, and expenses (including reasonable fees of
counsel), as incurred, to which each Warrantor, such director, officer or
partner of each Warrantor or such controlling person may become subject under
the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities or expenses (including all such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any actions or proceedings,
whether commenced or threatened) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Registration Statement or any preliminary, final or summary Prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, (ii) any omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statement therein not misleading, or (iii)
any violation or alleged violation by the Purchaser of the Securities Act,
Exchange Act or any other securities law or any rule or regulation thereunder,
in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not be liable to any such person
in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability
(or action or proceeding, whether commenced or threatened, in respect thereof)
or expense (x) arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such Registration
Statement, or preliminary, final or summary Prospectus, or amendment or
supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Purchaser by such person or by or on behalf of a Warrantor
expressly for use in the Registration Statement or preliminary, final or
summary Prospectus, amendment or supplement; (y) resulted from the fact that a
Warrantor sold Registrable Shares to a person to whom there was not sent or
given, at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented in any case where such delivery is
required by the Securities Act, if the Purchaser had previously complied with
the provisions of Section 1.1 and if the untrue statement contained in or
omission from such preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus was corrected in the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented or (z) arises out of or is based
upon sales of Registrable Shares by a Warrantor (A) after the delivery by the
Purchaser to such Warrantor of a Suspension Notice and before the delivery by
the Purchaser of the supplemented or amended Prospectus prepared and filed by
the Purchaser as provided in Section 1.2.3 or (B) during a Blackout Period
specified in Section 1.2.4. Such indemnification and reimbursement of expenses
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of each Warrantor, such director, officer or partner of such
Warrantor or such controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such
Registrable Shares by such Warrantor. 

| 
---|--- 

1.3.2

|

The Warrantors hereby agree, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Purchaser, each director and officer of the Purchaser and each
other person, if any, who controls the Purchaser within the meaning of the
Securities 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

108



Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
joint and several, and expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) to
which the Purchaser, such director or officer or controlling person may become
subject under the Securities Act, common law or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities or expenses (including all such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any actions or
proceedings, whether commenced or threatened), (i) arise out of or are based
upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact in
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated
in the Registration Statement, or any preliminary, final or summary Prospectus
contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, to the extent, but only to the
extent, such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Purchaser by or on behalf of a Warrantor expressly for use in the
Registration Statement or preliminary, final or summary Prospectus, amendment
or supplement (ii) result from the fact that a Warrantor sold Registrable
Shares to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to the
written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented in any case where such delivery is required by the Securities
Act, if the Purchaser had previously complied with the provisions of Section
1.1 and if the untrue statement contained in or omission from such preliminary
Prospectus or Prospectus was corrected in the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented or (iii) arise out of or are based upon sales of Registrable
Shares by a Warrantor (A) after the delivery by the Purchaser to such
Warrantor of a Suspension Notice and before the delivery by the Purchaser of
the supplemented or amended Prospectus prepared and filed by the Purchaser as
provided in Section 1.2.3 or (B) during a Blackout Period specified in Section
1.2.4. Such indemnification and reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Purchaser or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons or any
Warrantor or their respective directors, officers, partners and controlling
persons and shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Shares by such
Warrantor.

| 
---|--- 

1.3.3

|

Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party hereunder of written notice of
the commencement of any action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for
indemnification may be made pursuant to this Section 1.3, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an
indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement of
such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party to
give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of any
obligations hereunder except to the extent that the indemnifying party has
been prejudiced by such failure. In case any such action is brought against an
indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in
and to assume the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after such notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the
defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

109



be liable to such indemnified party for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the latter in connection with the defense thereof
unless the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such claim
and to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified person. An
indemnifying party who elects not to assume the defense of a claim shall not
be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel in any single
jurisdiction for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim, or with respect to claims separate but similar or
related in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations.
No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to a claim without the consent of the indemnified
party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, or unless such
judgment or settlement includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect of such claim. No indemnified party shall consent to
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any action the defense
of which has been assumed by an indemnifying party, and no indemnified party
shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any
action the defense of which has not been assumed by an indemnifying party
without the consent of such indemnifying party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

1.4

|

CONTRIBUTION 

| 
---|--- 

1.4.1

|

If for any reason the indemnification provided for in Sections 1.3.1 or 1.3.2
is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities specifically covered by
the indemnification provisions set forth in Sections 1.3.1 or 1.3.2, then the
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and
indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to
include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 1.3.2, any legal or
other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in defending any such
claim.

---|--- 

1.4.2

|

The Purchaser and each Warrantor agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section 1.4 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in Section 1.4.1. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Section 1.4, no Warrantor shall be required to contribute,
in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds
actually received

by such Warrantor from the sale of the Registrable Shares subject to the
applicable claim exceeds the amount of any damages that such Warrantor has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

| 
---|--- 

1.4.3

|

The contribution provided for in this Section 1.4 shall survive, with respect
to each Warrantor, the transfer of Registrable Shares by such Warrantor, and,
with respect to each Warrantor or the Purchaser, shall remain in full force
and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any
indemnified party. 

| 
---|--- 

1.4.4

|

Indemnification and contribution similar to that specified in Sections 1.3 and
1.4 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Purchaser and each
Warrantor with respect to any required registration or other qualification of
such Registrable Shares under any federal or state law or regulation of a
governmental authority other than the Securities Act. 

Section B

The United States Securities Act Representations by each Warrantor and
Agreements of each Warrantor and Purchaser

|

Each Warrantor understands that an investment in the Escrow Shares involves
substantial risk. Each Warrantor represents and warrants to the Purchaser that
such Warrantor (i) is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501
of Regulation D under the Securities Act, (ii) has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters as is necessary in order to
evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Escrow Shares, and (ii)
can bear the economic risk of an investment in the Escrow Shares. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

Each Warrantor represents and warrants to the Purchaser that the Escrow Shares
to be acquired by such Warrantor hereunder will be acquired for investment
purposes for such Warrantor's own account, not as a nominee or agent, and not
with a view to the resale or distribution thereof within the meaning of the
Securities Act, and each Warrantor has no present intention of selling,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the Escrow Shares;
provided, however, that by making the representations herein, such Warrantor
does not agree to hold any of the Escrow Shares for any minimum or other
specific term and reserves the right to dispose of the Escrow Shares at any
time in accordance with or pursuant to a registration statement or an
exemption under the Securities Act. 

| 
---|--- 

3.

|

Each Warrantor acknowledges that such Warrantor has had the opportunity to
review the information filed by the Purchaser in its filings with the SEC at
www.sec.gov. Each Warrantor acknowledges that the Purchaser has made available
to such Warrantor the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers
concerning Purchaser and its activities and all other matters relating to the
operations of Purchaser and the Escrow Shares, and that Purchaser has provided
responses to all such inquiries. Neither such inquiries nor any other
investigation conducted by or on behalf of such Warrantor or its
representatives or counsel shall modify, amend or 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

111



affect such Warrantor's right to rely on the truth, accuracy and completeness
of the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed or
furnished by the Purchaser with the SEC, the provisions of this Agreement,
including the Purchaser's warranties, and the schedules to this Agreement.

| 
---|--- 

4.

|

Each Warrantor acknowledges and agrees that, other than any information
provided pursuant to paragraph 3 above and the warranties in this Agreement,
such Warrantor is not relying on any other information, oral or written, that
such Warrantor may have received relating to the Purchaser or the Escrow
Shares. 

| 
---|--- 

5.

|

Each Warrantor represents and warrants that (i) at the time this Agreement was
executed and delivered by such Warrantor, such Warrantor is outside the United
States and (ii) such Warrantor is not a U.S. person (and is not purchasing for
the account or benefit of a U.S. person) within the meaning of Regulation S
under the Securities Act ("Regulation S"). 

| 
---|--- 

6.

|

Each Warrantor understands and agrees that offers and sales of any of the
Escrow Shares prior to the expiration of a period of six months after the date
of original issuance of the Escrow Shares (the "Distribution Compliance
Period") shall only be made in compliance with the safe harbour provisions set
forth in Regulation S, or pursuant to the registration provisions of the
Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and in accordance with applicable
state and foreign securities laws. Each Warrantor understands and agrees that
any purchaser of Escrow Shares from such Warrantor during the Distribution
Compliance Period, other than pursuant to the Registration Statement, must
certify to the Purchaser that it is not a U.S. Person and is not acquiring the
Escrow Shares for the account or benefit of any U.S. Person, or is a U.S.
Person purchasing the Escrow Shares in a transaction exempt from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act. Each Warrantor acknowledges and
agrees that all offers and sales after the Distribution Compliance Period
shall be made only in compliance with the registration provisions of the
Securities Act or an exemption therefrom and in each case only in accordance
with applicable state and foreign securities laws. 

| 
---|--- 

7.

|

Each Warrantor understands and agrees not to engage in any hedging
transactions involving any of the Escrow Shares unless such transactions are
in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act and in accordance with
applicable state and foreign securities laws. 

| 
---|--- 

8.

|

Each Warrantor agrees that each of the Escrow Shares will contain a legend
substantially to the following effect: 

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR
APPLICABLE STATE OR FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE MAY BE NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED
UNLESS (A) REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE AND
FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS, (B) TRANSFERRED IN



HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

112



ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND
APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS OR (C) PURSUANT TO AN AVAILABLE
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE AND
FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS, AND IN THE CASE OF (B) AND (C) (OTHER THAN A SALE
PURSUANT TO RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, PROVIDED THAT THE TRANSFEROR
PROVIDES THE COMPANY WITH REASONABLE ASSURANCES THAT SUCH SECURITIES MAY BE
SOLD PURSUANT TO SUCH RULE) THE HOLDER HAS PROVIDED TO THE COMPANY AN OPINION
FROM COUNSEL REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY AS TO SUCH MATTERS. HEDGING
TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE
CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ALL APPLICABLE
STATE AND FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS. THE ISSUER AND ITS TRANSFER AGENT ARE
REQUIRED TO REFUSE TO TRANSFER ANY SHARES NOT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE
REQUIREMENTS.

| 
---|--- 

9.

|

At the written request of a holder of the Escrow Shares, the Purchaser shall
instruct its transfer agent to remove the legend set forth above from any
certificate or "book entry" evidencing the Escrow Shares if (i) such Escrow
Shares have been sold pursuant to the Plan of Distribution set forth in the
Registration Statement, (ii) in connection with a sale, assignment or other
transfer, such Warrantor provides the Purchaser with an opinion of counsel,
the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser, that the sale, assignment or transfer of the Escrow Shares may be
made without registration under the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and that as a result of such sale, assignment or transfer such legend may
be removed or (iii) such holder provides the Purchaser with reasonable
assurance that the Escrow Shares have been sold under Rule 144 (in the form of
seller and, if applicable, broker representation letter(s)). 

| 
---|--- 

10.

|

Each Warrantor acknowledges and agrees with Purchaser that Purchaser and its
transfer agent are required to refuse to register any transfer of the Escrow
Shares not made in accordance with provisions of Regulation S, pursuant to
registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an available exemption
from registration under the Securities Act. 

| 
---|--- 

11.

|

Each Warrantor represents and agrees that such Warrantor understands that no
action has been taken or will be taken (except as contemplated by Section A of
Part 17 of this Agreement with respect to the Registrable Shares) in any
jurisdiction by the Purchaser that would permit a public offering of the
Escrow Shares, or possession or distribution of any offering or publicity 

 

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

113



material related to the Escrow Shares in any country or jurisdiction where
action for that purpose is required and such Warrantor has complied and will
comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which
such Warrantor acquires, offers, sells or delivers Escrow Shares or has in
such Warrantor\'s possession or distributes any such offering or publicity
material.

Section C



Independent Nature of Each Warrantor's Obligations and Rights; Successors and
Assigns.

| 
---|--- 

1.

|

The obligations of each Warrantor under this Schedule - Part 17 are several
and not joint with the obligations of each other Warrantor, and no Warrantor
shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any
other Warrantor hereunder. Nothing contained herein or in this Agreement, and
no action taken by any Warrantor pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed
to constitute the Warrantor as a partnership, an association, a joint venture
or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Warrantors are
in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or
the transactions contemplated by this Schedule - Part 17. 

| 
---|--- 

2.

|

No party shall assign any of its rights or obligations under this Schedule -
Part 17 without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that
(i) the right to cause the Purchaser to register Registrable Shares hereunder
may be assigned (but only with all related obligations) by a Warrantor to a
transferee who acquires all of such party's Registrable Shares from such
Warrantor (other than a transfer pursuant to the Registration Statement or in
accordance with Rule 144), as long as such the transferor provides written
notice of the transfer to the Company and the transferee agrees in writing to
be bound by the provisions of this Schedule - Part 17, and (ii) the Company
may assign its rights and related obligations hereunder to a successor in
ownership of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
by merger, consolidation or sale without the prior written consent of any
Warrantor; as long as the Company provides written notice to the Warrantors of
such assignment and the assignee of this Agreement agrees in writing to be
bound by this Schedule - Part 17. Any assignment, delegation or transfer in
violation of this section shall be void.

warrants to Warrantors as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date
(except to the extent that such representations and warranties expressly speak
as of a specified earlier date) as follows: 

Organization and Related Matters.

Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the state of its incorporation, except where the
failure to be so in good standing would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect. Purchaser has all necessary corporate power and authority to carry on

Authorization.

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and any related
agreements by Purchaser have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of Purchaser and by all other necessary corporate action on the part
of Purchaser. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its
terms except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

relating to or limiting creditors\' rights generally.

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or any related
agreements required to be entered



HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

116



into hereby by Purchaser will not (1) conflict with or result in a violation

(2) subject to obtaining or making the consents, approvals, notices, orders,
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings referred to in
paragraph (b) below, contravene any Law currently in effect, or (3) conflict
with or result in a breach of, or default under any Contract to which
Purchaser is a party or to which Purchaser or any of its respective properties

(2) and (3) above, for any such contraventions, conflicts, breaches, defaults
or other occurrences that would not have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Other than the governmental approvals specified in the Agreement, no consent,
approval, notice, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity, is necessary or required to be obtained
or made in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Purchaser, the performance by Purchaser of its obligations hereunder or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such items
that the failure to make or obtain, as the case may be, would not have a
Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

No Brokers or Finders.

No agent, broker, finder or investment or commercial banker, or other Person
or firms engaged by or acting on behalf of Purchaser or its Affiliates in
connection with the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or

broker\'s or finder\'s or similar fees or other commissions as a result of
this Agreement or such transactions.

would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, or (ii) questions the validity
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any

HIF/0001/00024/23823897 v2

* * *

117



As of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser is not subject to any
outstanding Order that would have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

Completion of Transaction.

specific to Purchaser that it reasonably believes would prevent Purchaser from
fulfilling its material obligations under this Agreement and completing the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Act (such forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents, including

Each of the Euronet SEC Reports complied at the time of filing in all material
respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the dates such

such unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q and Form 8-K of the SEC,
and fairly presented (subject, in the case of the unaudited statements, to the

118



notes and normal year-end audit adjustments), in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Purchaser as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended.

Except for such matters as have not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Purchaser Material Adverse
Effect, Purchaser is in compliance with the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

is issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2013, the number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock on a weighted average diluted basis was 51,982,620.

(b) The shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this

claim, deficiency, guaranty or endorsement of any type whether accrued,

in financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which individually or in the
aggregate, (i) has not been reflected in the Purchaser Financial Statements,
or (ii) has not arisen in the ordinary course of Purchaser\'s business since
the date of the most recent Purchaser Financial Statement.
