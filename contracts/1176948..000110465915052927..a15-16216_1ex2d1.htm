appropriate (the " **Adjustment Amendment** ") solely to reallocate the
portion of the Total Consideration that each KA Owner is

 



       
 

 



 

receiving to reflect the reduction in the value of the Total Consideration as
a result of the Adjustment Percentage being less than 95%. The Sellers
Representative shall submit the Adjustment Amendment, if any, to the Buyers no
later than the Adjustment Amendment Date.

 **2.6.** **_Adjustments to Total Consideration_** **.**

 



 

(a) _Closing Adjustment_. At least three, but not more than five, Business
Days, before the Closing, KACALP shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in
good faith and deliver to the Buyers a statement (the " **Estimated Closing
Statement** ") setting forth (A) its estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet
(the " **Estimated Closing Balance Sheet** ") and (B) a calculation in
reasonable detail based upon such Estimated Closing Balance Sheet of its
estimate of Working Capital (the " **Estimated Working Capital** ") and
Closing Indebtedness. Following delivery of the Estimated Closing Statement,
the KA Parties shall promptly provide (i) such information as the Buyers may
reasonably request to allow the Buyers to review the Estimated Closing
Statement and (ii) subject to the execution of any documentation reasonably
requested by its accountants in connection therewith, access to its
accountants relating to the Estimated Closing Statement.

 



 

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) No later than 60 days following the Closing Date, the Buyers shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, in good faith and deliver to the Sellers
Representative the Closing Balance Sheet and a calculation in reasonable
detail based upon such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth the amount of
Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness (the " **Post-Closing Statement** ").
Following delivery of the Post-Closing Statement, the Buyers shall promptly
provide (i) such information as the Sellers Representative may reasonably
request to allow the Sellers Representative to review the Post-Closing
Statement, and (ii) subject to the execution of any documentation reasonably
requested by its accountants in connection therewith, access to its
accountants relating to the Post-Closing Statement.

 



 

(ii) If the Sellers Representative in good faith disputes any item or amount
contained in the Closing Balance Sheet or the calculation of Working Capital
or Closing Indebtedness, in each case set forth in the Post-Closing Statement,
the Sellers Representative

 



      
 

 



 

may deliver a written notice (the " **WC Dispute Notice** ") to the Buyers
during the 45-day period following delivery of the Post-Closing Statement (the
" **WC Review Period** "), which notice shall set forth, in reasonable detail,
the grounds for, amount of, and alternate calculations with respect to, each
disputed item or amount (each such item or amount, a " **WC Disputed Item**
"). If the Sellers Representative delivers a WC Dispute Notice to the Buyers
during the WC Review Period, (A) during the 45-day period following the
delivery of such notice (the " **Resolution Period** "), the Sellers
Representative and the Buyers shall use their good faith efforts and
reasonably cooperate to resolve their differences with respect to the WC
Disputed Items, and any resolution by them as to any WC Disputed Items shall
be final, conclusive and binding, and (B) the Sellers Representative shall
promptly provide (x) such information as the Buyers may reasonably request to
allow the Buyers to review the WC Dispute Notice and each WC Disputed Item,
and (y) subject to the execution of any documentation reasonably requested by
its accountants in connection therewith, access to its accountants relating to
the WC Dispute Notice and each WC Disputed Item. Any item or amount set forth
on the Closing Balance Sheet that is not a WC Disputed Item shall be deemed
accepted by the parties and shall be final, conclusive and binding, except to
the extent an adjustment to a WC Disputed Item made in accordance with this
_Section 2.6_ requires an adjustment to be made to an undisputed item. If the
Sellers Representative does not deliver a WC Dispute Notice to the Buyers
during the WC Review Period, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Working Capital
and Closing Indebtedness as calculated by the Buyers shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

 



 

(iii) The Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall, within 30 days after
the expiration of the Resolution Period, retain the Accountant to resolve any
remaining WC Disputed Items in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
The Accountant shall conduct its review of such WC Disputed Items, any related
work papers of the parties or their accountants, and any supporting
documentation, and hear such presentations by the parties, as the Accountant
deems necessary. The Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate
with one another and the Accountant to resolve the remaining WC Disputed Items
so that the Accountant may deliver to the Sellers Representative and the
Buyers a written report setting forth its resolution of such WC Disputed Items
(the " **Adjustment Report** ") no later than 30 days following the date of
the Accountants retention. The Accountant may not assign or adjust a value to
any WC Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such item, or less
than the smallest value for such item, claimed by any such party. The costs
and expenses of the Accountant shall be allocated between the Buyers, on the
one hand, and the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the KA Owners), on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the aggregate amount
of the items unsuccessfully disputed by each party bears to the total amount
of the WC Disputed Items, as determined by the Accountant. The Adjustment
Report, and the Accountants allocation of its costs and expenses between the
parties, shall be final, conclusive and binding, and shall be deemed a final
arbitration award that is enforceable in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

(iv) Effective upon (x) the end of the WC Review Period (if a timely WC
Dispute Notice is not delivered), (y) the resolution of all matters set forth
in the WC Dispute Notice by written agreement of the Sellers Representative
and the Buyers or (z) the issuance of the Adjustment Report, (1) the amount of
Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness shall be adjusted if and to the
extent necessary to reflect the final resolution of any WC Disputed Items

 



      
 

 



 

and (2) the Base Cash Consideration shall be recalculated (such recalculated
amount, the " **Final Base Cash Consideration** ") using such finally
determined amounts in lieu of the amounts set forth on the Estimated Closing
Statement with respect thereto.

 



 

(A) If the Final Base Cash Consideration is greater than the Closing Base Cash
Consideration (the amount of the difference, an " **Upward Base Cash
Adjustment** "), then, within five Business Days after receiving notice of the
determination thereof, the Buyers (or the applicable Buyer) shall pay the
Upward Base Cash Adjustment (without interest) to KA RetainCo, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
Sellers Representative. Upon making the Upward Base Cash Adjustment payment,
the Buyers shall have satisfied their obligations to make such payment, and no
Buyer Affiliate or any Representative thereof shall have any Liability with
respect to the distribution or disposition thereof.

 



 

(B) If the Final Base Cash Consideration is less than the Closing Base Cash
Consideration (the amount of the difference, a " **Downward Base Cash
Adjustment** "), then, within five Business Days after receiving notice of the
determination thereof, the KA RetainCo Owners shall cause KA RetainCo to pay
to the Buyers (or the applicable Buyer) the Downward Base Cash Adjustment
(without interest), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the Buyers (or the applicable Buyer). If KA RetainCo does
not timely pay the Downward Base Cash Adjustment, the Buyers may recover the
amount of such payment from the KA Owners, on a Pro Rata Percentage basis, in
accordance with _Section 9.4_.

 



 

 **2.7.** **_Merger_** **.** Within one Business Day following the KAFA
Acquisition and the KACALP Acquisition, the KA Owners and the Buyers shall
cause the merger of a subsidiary of a KA Party with and into a subsidiary of a
Buyer, in accordance with the terms set forth on _Section 2.7 of the KA
Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

 **2.8.** **_Ares Reorganization Event_** **.** If an Ares Reorganization
Event occurs between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the parties shall
enter into an amendment to this Agreement, and the Transaction Documents shall
be amended, in each case, as reasonably proposed in good faith by the Buyers,
as may be appropriate to reflect such Ares Reorganization Event so that the
intent, spirit, operation and effect of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents shall, to the maximum extent possible, be preserved
after taking into account such Ares Reorganization Event. The Buyers may not
effect an Ares Reorganization Event without the prior consent of the Sellers
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) other
than an Ares Reorganization Event in which (a) Ares Domestic is merged with
and into, or all or a material portion of the equity interests or assets of
Ares Domestic are transferred to, AH LP or its Subsidiaries or (b) Ares Real
Estate is merged with and into, or all or a material portion of the equity
interests or assets of Ares Real Estate are transferred to, AI LP or its
Subsidiaries, in each case, in accordance with the terms set forth on _Annex
Q_.

 



 

 **2.9.** **_Waiver of Distributions for Pre-Closing Period_** **. **Each KA
Owner, on its behalf and on behalf of its transferees and its and their
respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns, irrevocably
and unconditionally waives all rights such KA Owner or such other Persons may
have to receive, directly or indirectly, any Ares Pre-Closing Distributions.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.10.** **_Ares Kayne Management, L.P._** From and after the Closing, the
name of Ares Management shall be "Ares Kayne Management, L.P." Within one
Business Day after the Closing, the Buyers shall cause to be filed an
amendment of the certificate of limited partnership of Ares Management with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change the name of Ares
Management to "Ares Kayne Management, L.P."

 



 

 **2.11.** **_Assignment of Buyer Rights_**. Prior to the Closing, (a) AH LP
shall assign its right to purchase 0.1% of the KAFA Interests to its wholly
owned corporate Subsidiary and (b) AI LP shall assign its right to purchase
0.1% of the KACALP Interests to its wholly owned corporate Subsidiary.

 



 

 **2.12.** **_Additional Transaction Payments_**.

 



 

(a) At the Closing, the Buyers shall, or shall cause other Buyer Affiliates
to, deliver to each Person set forth on _Annex R_ (i) the amount of cash
specified opposite such Persons name on _Annex R_ , and (ii) the number of
(A) Ares Common Units specified opposite such Persons name on _Annex R_ and
(B) Ares Operating Group Units specified opposite such Persons name on _Annex
R, provided_ that, in the case of clause (ii), such Person (A) executes and
delivers, as applicable, a fair competition agreement (if so indicated on
_Annex R_ ), a restricted unit award letter (which will provide, among other
things, that (x) the Ares Common Units awarded thereunder will vest in three
equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the Closing and (y) the
transfer restrictions applicable thereto will lapse concurrently with the
vesting thereof), contribution agreement, joinder agreement, lock-up agreement
and other agreements reasonably requested by the Buyers, in each case, in form
and substance satisfactory to the Buyers and the Sellers Representative and
(B) delivers any withholding amount due in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) Until the 10th Business Day prior to the Closing, the Sellers
Representative may amend _Annex R_ (the " **Transaction Payment Amendment**
"), solely to change the amount of cash, the number of Ares Common Units, the
number of Ares Operating Group Units or the Persons set forth on _Annex R_ ;
_provided_ that (i) the aggregate amount of cash _plus_ the value of the Ares
Common Units (valued at the Issue Price) _plus_ the value of the Ares
Operating Group Units (valued at the Issue Price) to be paid as set forth on
_Annex R_ shall not be more than $5,000,000 in excess of the aggregate amount
of cash _plus_ the value of the Ares Common Units (valued at the Issue Price)
_plus_ the value of the Ares Common Units (valued at the Issue Price) set
forth on _Annex R_ on the date hereof, (ii) each Person set forth on _Annex R_
may only receive a whole number of Ares Common Units or Ares Operating Group
Units and (iii) no (x) Person other than a Continuing Employee or (y) KA Owner
may be set forth on _Annex R_.

 



 

(c) If in the good faith belief of the Buyers the delivery of Ares Operating
Group Units pursuant to this _Section 2.12_ could reasonably be expected to
have any adverse tax, accounting, financial, regulatory or any other adverse
effect on any Buyer Affiliate or the equityholders of Ares Management, each
Person with Ares Operating Group Units specified opposite such Persons name
on _Annex R_ shall receive an equal number of Ares Common Units in lieu of the
Ares Operating Group Units as specified opposite such Persons name on _Annex
R_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **2.13.** **_Additional Interests to KA RetainCo Owners_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 2.5_, promptly following each fiscal quarter of Ares
Management ending on or after the Closing, the Buyers shall, or shall cause
other Buyer Affiliates to, deliver to each KA RetainCo Owner that is then a
Continuing Employee a number of Ares Operating Group Units equal to (i) such
KA RetainCo Owners KA RetainCo Pro Rata Percentage _multiplied by_ (ii) the
remainder of (x) the aggregate number of Forfeited Column 2 Class KA Units for
such fiscal quarter _minus_ (y) the Column 2 Separation Amount, rounded down
to the nearest whole number; _provided_ that such KA RetainCo Owner executes
and delivers all agreements reasonably requested by the Buyers, in each case,
in form and substance satisfactory to the Buyers and the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(b) The Ares Owners Units received by each KA RetainCo Owner in exchange for
such Ares Operating Group Units will be subject to the same vesting,
forfeiture, lock-up and other provisions set forth in such KA RetainCo Owners
Contribution Agreement, Lock-up Agreement, the Ares Owners LP Agreement and
all other agreements entered into by such KA RetainCo Owner (or its
Principal), in each case, as are applicable to the Column 1 Class KA Units
received by such KA RetainCo Owner on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this _Section 2.13_, if any
reorganization, recapitalization, exchange, merger, consolidation or other
similar transaction (a " **Reorganization** ") occurs with respect to one or
more Ares Operating Group Entities, then, in lieu of such Ares Operating Group
Units, the Buyers shall, or shall cause other Buyer Affiliates to, deliver to
the applicable KA RetainCo Owners such other equity consideration that such KA
RetainCo Owners would have been entitled to receive immediately following such
Reorganization had such KA RetainCo Owners owned such Ares Operating Group
Units immediately prior to such Reorganization.

 



 

 **2.14.** **_Adjustment to Form of Total Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) If the Buyers deliver a Consideration Adjustment Notice on or prior to the
15th Business Day prior to the Closing, the parties shall enter into an
amendment to this Agreement, and the Transaction Documents shall be amended,
in each case, as proposed by the Buyers and subject to the prior written
consent of the Sellers Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), as may be appropriate to reflect the Cash Reduction
Amount, the Equity Increase Amount and all related matters, so that the
intent, spirit, operation and effect of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents shall, to the maximum extent possible, be preserved
after taking into account delivery of such Consideration Adjustment Notice (it
being understood that the Additional Cash Consideration shall be increased,
and the KA Owners may receive additional cash consideration to purchase
additional equity interests in AI LP). _Annex N_ shows a preliminary
calculation of AOG Amount, AH Additional Cash Consideration and AI Additional
Cash Consideration assuming the Adjustment Percentage is 100% and the Cash
Reduction Amount is $250,000,000.

 



 

(b) Within five Business Days after the Buyers delivery of a Consideration
Adjustment Notice, the Sellers Representative shall amend _Annex F_ to
provide that the value of the portion of the Total Consideration that each KA
Owner is receiving (based on the Issue

 



      
 

 



 

Price) is equal to the value of the portion of the Total Consideration that
such KA Owner would have received had no Consideration Adjustment Notice been
delivered. Any such amendment to _Annex F_ shall (i) only amend a KA Owners
Pro Rata Percentage, Cash Percentage, Equity Percentage, Column 1 Equity
Percentage or Column 2 Equity Percentage, (ii) not increase the aggregate
amount of Ares Operating Group Units that any KA Owner who is not (and whose
Principal is not) a Continuing Employee receives pursuant to the Transaction
Documents, (iii) not increase the number of Column 2 Class KA Units that any
KA RetainCo Owner (or any KA Owner whose Principal is a KA RetainCo Owner)

their Column 2 Equity Percentages is not increased and (iv) not increase a KA
Owners Pro Rata Percentage, Cash Percentage, Equity Percentage, Column 1
Equity Percentage or Column 2 Equity Percentage in an amount greater than the
highest Pro Rata Percentage, Cash Percentage, Equity Percentage, Column 1
Equity Percentage or Column 2 Equity Percentage set forth on either _Annex F_
or _Annex F-1_ with respect to such KA Owner or decrease a KA Owners Pro Rata
Percentage, Cash Percentage, Equity Percentage, Column 1 Equity Percentage or
Column 2 Equity Percentage in an amount lower than the lowest Pro Rata
Percentage, Cash Percentage, Equity Percentage, Column 1 Equity Percentage or
Column 2 Equity Percentage set forth on either _Annex F_ or _Annex F-1_ with
respect to such KA Owner. _Annex F-1_ is a preliminary amendment of _Annex F_
assuming the Adjustment Percentage is 100% and the Cash Reduction Amount is
$250,000,000.

Transaction Document to which such KA Owner is a party has been, or will be,
when executed and delivered, duly and validly executed and delivered by such
KA Owner and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof
by the Buyer Affiliates party thereto, constitutes, or when executed and
delivered, will constitute, the valid and legally binding obligation of such
KA Owner, enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by
Bankruptcy Laws and Principles of Equity.

 



 

 **3.2.** **_Noncontravention; Governmental Approvals_** **. **Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of any Transaction Document to which such
KA Owner is a party nor the consummation of the Transactions will, with or
without notice or lapse of time or both, (a) if such KA Owner is not an
individual, violate any provision of its Organizational Documents,

 



      
 

 



 

(b) violate, or require any material notice or material Consent under, any Law
to which such KA Owner or any of its assets is subject, (c) conflict with,
result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in the acceleration

such KA Owner is a party or is subject or to which any of its assets is
subject or (d) result in the creation of a Lien on any of its assets, except,
in the case of clauses (c) and (d), to the extent that any such violation,
conflict, breach, default or other matter would not result in a KA Material
Adverse Effect. Such KA Owner is not in violation of any of the provisions of
the Organizational Documents of any KA Entity or KA Fund.

 



 

 **3.3.** **_Proceedings_** **. **There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of
such KA Owner, threatened Action relating to such KA Owner that questions or
otherwise challenges the validity or propriety of any Transaction Document or
any of the Transactions (including with respect to such KA Owners ownership
of equity interests in any KA Entity or ability to execute or perform any of
the Transaction Documents).

 



 

 **3.4.** **_Ownership of KACALP and KAFA_**.

 



 

(a) As of the date hereof, such KA Owner owns, beneficially and of record, the
KACALP Interests, the KAFA Interests and the Additional EPE Interests set
forth opposite such KA Owners name on _Annex B_. Immediately prior to the
Closing (after giving effect to the Equity Restructuring), such KA Owner (i)
will own, beneficially and of record, the KACALP Interests, the KAFA Interests
and the Additional EPE Interests set forth opposite such KA Owners name on
_Annex C_ , in each case, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted
Liens and Liens created by the Buyer Affiliates) and (ii) will not own any
other equity interests in any KA Entity (other than employee vehicles which
receive a portion of the Carried Interests, as set forth on _Annex D_ ).

 



 

(b) Other than the Organizational Documents of the applicable KA Entity, there
are no Contracts to which such KA Owner is a party or is subject with respect
to (i) any equity interests in any KA Entity (including the transfer,

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES RELATING TO THE KA ENTITIES**

 



 

Each KA Party, jointly and severally, represents and warrants to the Buyers
that the statements contained in this _ARTICLE IV_ are true and correct as of
the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, except as set forth in the KA
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

 **4.1.** **_Organization, Authorization and Enforceability_**.

 



 

(a) Each KA Entity is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of formation or organization and has full
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. Each KA Entity is duly qualified or licensed
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the assets owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for any
failures to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing that would not
result in a KA Material Adverse Effect. KACALP has delivered to the Buyers
complete and correct copies of the Organizational Documents of each KA Entity,
each of which are in full force and effect. No KA Entity is, or since January
1, 2013 has been, in violation of its Organizational Documents.

 



 

(b) Each KA Entity has full power and authority to execute and deliver each
Transaction Document to which it is a party, to perform its obligations
hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate the Transactions. The execution
and delivery by any KA Entity of each Transaction Document, the performance by
such KA Entity of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the
consummation by such KA Entity of the Transactions have been duly authorized
by all requisite action on the part of such KA Entity. Each Transaction
Document to which any KA Entity is a party has been, or will be, when executed
and delivered, duly and validly executed and delivered by such KA Entity and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Buyer
Affiliates party thereto, constitutes, or when executed and delivered, will
constitute, the valid and legally binding obligation of such KA Entity,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as limited by Bankruptcy Laws
and Principles of Equity.

 



 

 **4.2.** **_Noncontravention; Governmental Approvals_** **. **Neither the
execution, delivery or performance of any Transaction Document by a KA Entity
nor the consummation of the Transactions will, with or without notice or lapse
of time or both, (a) violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of
any KA Entity or KA Fund, (b) violate, or require any material notice or
material Consent under, any Law to which any KA Entity or KA Fund or any of
such Persons assets is subject (including any Consent with FERC), (c)
conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under, result in
the acceleration of any right or obligation under, require any notice or
Consent under, or create in any Person the right to accelerate, terminate,
modify, cancel, revoke or exercise any other remedy under, any (i) Material
Contract or (ii) Permit, or (d) result in the creation of a Lien on any assets
of any KA Entity or KA Fund, except, in the case of clauses (c)(ii) and (d) of
this _Section 4.2_, to the extent that any such conflict, breach, default,
right or Lien would not result in a KA Material Adverse Effect or a Material
Fund Change.

each KA Entity (i) are duly authorized, fully paid and non-assessable (to the

compliance in all material respects with all applicable Laws. There are no (i)
outstanding Options or Contracts to issue Options with respect to any KA
Entity or (ii) obligations, contingent or otherwise, of any KA Entity to

provide funds to or make any investment in, and there are no rights plans
affecting, any KA Entity, in each case, other than Options or obligations (x)

are no Contracts to which any KA Entity is a party or is subject (i) with
respect to (A) any equity interests in any KA Entity (including the transfer,
disposition or voting thereof) or (B) the nomination, designation or election

or otherwise subject to any Contract that defers, caps, waives, offsets,
reimburses, reduces, returns or otherwise modifies any fees, charges or other
amounts payable to any KA Entity or KA Fund or to be paid by any Client or KA
Fund Investor. Without limiting the foregoing, no Management Fees or Carried

 **4.5.** **_Financial Statements; Certain Liabilities_**.

 



 

(a) KACALP has delivered to the Buyers complete and correct copies of the

and Unreviewed Financial Statements have been prepared (x) from, and are in
accordance in all material respects with, KACALPs books and records, and (y)
in accordance with GAAP (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of
operations, changes in members capital and cash flows of KACALP and its

case of the KACALP Balance Sheet to normal year-end-adjustments that are
immaterial in nature and amount and the absence of notes).

 



 

(b) KACALP and its Subsidiaries have established and maintain systems of

accordance with GAAP and (B) access to their property and assets is permitted
only in accordance with managements general or specific authorization and
(ii) regarding the prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,

the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of
KACALP, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of the KA Funds, or their respective
internal accounting controls.

 



 

(c) The Signing Pro Forma Financial Statements and, as of the Closing Date,
all Pro Forma Financial Statements: (i) have been properly presented on the
bases described

Closing Date, the adjustments used in all Pro Forma Financial Statements) are
appropriate to give effect to the transactions, actions and circumstances
referred to therein and have been properly applied to the historical amounts
in the compilation thereof. The Additional Financial Data delivered to the

(d) _Section 4.5(d) of the KA Disclosure_ _Schedule_ (i) sets forth the
Indebtedness of each KA Entity as of the date hereof and (ii) identifies the

Since December 31, 2014, there has not occurred any Event that, individually

Adverse Effect or a Material Fund Change.

 



 

 **4.6.** **_Proceedings_** **.** Since January 1, 2013, there has been no
pending or, to the Knowledge of any KA Entity, threatened Action (a) involving
any KA Entity, any KA Fund or any of their respective directors, members,

be expected to result in a material Liability or otherwise be material to (x)
KACALP and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) KAFA and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (z) any KA Fund set forth on _Section 7.1(e) of the KA

Governmental Entity with respect to any KA Entity or KA Fund.

 



 

 **4.7.** **_Taxes_**.

 



 

(a) Each KA Entity and KA Fund (that is not a Public Fund) has always been
properly treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as either (i) a
partnership that is not a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation
under Section 7704(a) of the Code, or (ii) an entity disregarded as separate
from its owner. Each KA REIT has been organized and operated in conformity in
all material respects with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under
the Code, and its proposed method of operation will enable it to be qualified
as a REIT under the Code for its taxable years ending December 31, 2015 and
thereafter. Each Subsidiary of a KA

 



      
 

 



 

REIT that is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, other than
any qualified REIT subsidiary as defined in Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, has
been in compliance in all material respects with all requirements applicable
to a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the
Code and all applicable Treasury Regulations thereunder. Each KA RIC has been
organized and operated in conformity in all material respects with the
requirements for qualification as a RIC under the Code, and its proposed
method of operation will enable it to be qualified as a RIC under the Code for
its taxable years ending December 31, 2015 and thereafter.

 



 

(b) All Tax Returns required to have been filed by a KA Entity or KA Fund have
been duly and timely filed (after giving effect to any valid extensions of
time in which to make such filings), and all such Tax Returns are complete and
correct in all material respects. With respect to any period or portion
thereof for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed, or for which Taxes are
not yet due or owing, each KA Entity and KA Fund has established due and
sufficient reserves for the payment of such Taxes in accordance with GAAP and
all other applicable generally accepted accounting standard for non-U.S.
purposes.

 



 

(c) All Taxes that have become due and payable by a KA Entity or KA Fund have
been fully and timely paid when due. There are no Liens as a result of any
unpaid Taxes (other than current Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any of
the assets of a KA Entity.

 



 

(d) Each KA Entity and KA Fund has (i) withheld and paid all Taxes (including
Taxes imposed under FATCA) required to have been withheld and paid by such
Person in connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, KA Fund Investor or other Person and (ii) complied in
all material respects with all information reporting provisions of applicable
Law (including under FATCA and requirements to obtain a properly executed IRS
Form W-8 or W-9 from each KA Fund Investor).

 



 

(e) No material deficiencies for Taxes with respect to a KA Entity or KA Fund
have been proposed in writing or assessed by any Tax authority. There are no
outstanding, pending or, to the Knowledge of any KA Entity, threatened Tax
proceedings in respect of a KA Entity or KA Fund. There is no outstanding
waiver by a KA Entity or KA Fund of any statute of limitations with respect to
Taxes of such Person.

 



 

(f) No KA Entity or KA Fund will be required (i) as a result of a change in
method of accounting for any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date
to include any adjustment under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of any state, local, or foreign Law) in taxable
income, or disallowance of deductions, for any Tax period (or portion thereof)
ending after the Closing Date or (ii) to include any item of income in taxable
income for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date
as a result of any (x) prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date
or (y) "closing agreement" described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding provision of any state, local, or foreign Law).

 



 

(g) No KA Entity or KA Fund has any Liability for the Taxes of any other
Person under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any corresponding
provision of any state, local, or foreign Law), by Contract or otherwise.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) _Section 4.7(h) of the KA Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth, for the tax
year ended December 31, 2013, for each KA Entity and KA Fund, a list of each
state, territory and jurisdiction (whether foreign or domestic) in which such
Person files or is required to file a Tax Return. To the Knowledge of any KA
Entity, no Tax authority in any state, territory or jurisdiction where a KA
Entity or KA Fund does not file a Tax Return has made a claim that such Person
is required to file a Tax Return in such state, territory or jurisdiction.

 



 

(i) No KA Entity or KA Fund has (i) engaged in any transaction that is a
"reportable transaction" for U.S. federal income tax purposes within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4, or (ii) made an election to
be treated as an "electing investment partnership" within the meaning of
Section 743(e)(6) of the Code.

 



 

(j) Except as disclosed on _Annex J_ , each of the Carried Interests set forth
on _Annex J_ constitutes a validly issued "profits interest" as that term is
used in IRS Revenue Procedures 93-27 and 2001-43.

 



 

(k) KACALP has filed with the IRS the Change Requests with all schedules,
attachments, written materials and other documents related thereto.

Primary KA Owner or, to the Knowledge of any KA Entity, any of their
respective covered associates, has directly or indirectly (i) made any
contribution to any official of a Governmental Entity or (ii) made any payment

Entity, any of their respective covered associates, in each case, since
September 30, 2013 that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Rule
206(4)-5 under the Advisers Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

Law or (ii) required to be registered, licensed or qualified as a broker-
dealer under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(k) KACALP has delivered to the Buyers complete and correct copies of all
material books and records of each Governing Body of, and equityholder
consents and minute books of, each KA Entity since January 1, 2013.

 



 

(l) No KA Entity or, to the Knowledge of any KA Entity, "affiliated person"
(as defined in the Investment Company Act or the Advisers Act) of a KA Entity

registered investment company or (ii) is ineligible or subject to

reasonably be expected to result in, or provide the basis for, such
ineligibility or disqualification.

 



 

(m) This _Section 4.8_ does not relate to (i) Taxes, which are addressed in
_Section 4.7_ or (ii) Benefit Plans, which are addressed in _Section 4.12_.

 



 

 **4.9.** **_KA Funds; Other Clients_**.

 



 

(a) KACALP has delivered to the Buyers complete and correct copies of the
Organizational Documents and Offering Materials pertaining to the KA Funds and
Management Agreements and Sideletters.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) KACALP has delivered to the Buyers complete and correct copies of each
available Fund Financial Statements. Each Fund Financial Statement (x)
required to be prepared for any KA Fund (by the Offering Materials or
Organizational Documents of such KA Fund, applicable Law or otherwise) has
been duly and timely prepared and delivered, (y) has been prepared from, and
in accordance in all material respects with, the books and records of the
applicable KA Fund, and (z) has been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and presents fairly, in all material
respects, the financial condition, results of operations, changes in capital
and cash flows of the applicable KA Fund, as of the dates and for the periods
indicated (subject, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments that are immaterial in nature and amount and the absence
of notes).

 



 

(c) Each KA Fund is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its jurisdiction of formation or organization and has full
power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and to carry on its
business as presently conducted. Each KA Fund is duly qualified or licensed to
do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where it is
required to do so under applicable Law, except for any failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Fund Change. All of the issued and outstanding
equity interests of each KA Fund are duly authorized, fully paid and non-
assessable (to the extent such concepts are applicable) (other than to the
extent they are subject to capital calls pursuant to the Organizational
Documents of each such KA Fund) and have been validly issued in compliance
with all applicable Law and applicable Organizational Documents. A Management
Agreement has been in full force and effect at all times that any KA Entity
was performing investment management, advisory or sub-advisory services for
such KA Fund. Each Contract pursuant to which any KA Entity has received
compensation from a KA Fund was duly approved in accordance with the
applicable Organizational Documents of such KA Fund and applicable Law.

with applicable securities Laws.

 



 

(e) Each Public Fund is duly registered (i) with all applicable Governmental
Entities as an investment company or a regulated fund and (ii) for the purpose

KA Fund has been required to register as an investment company under (i) the
Investment Company Act, by virtue of exclusions from such definition under
Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) or (ii) the comparable regulatory regime of
any other jurisdiction. Each KA Fund (and each operator thereof) has, since
inception, (x) not constituted a "commodity pool" or a "commodity trading
account" within the meaning of the CEA, (y) been exempt from registration (by
virtue of its operator being so exempt as a commodity pool operator under the
CEA) and has filed an appropriate claim of exclusion or exemption to the
extent required and (z) filed all applicable documentation with the National
Futures Association except to the extent the failure of which to file
documentation would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably
expected to materially impair its ability to conduct its business.

 



 

(f) Since January 1, 2013, each of the KA Funds has timely (i) filed all Fund
Reports and (ii) delivered to each investor or offeree of an investment in a
KA Fund Offering Materials relating to such KA Fund, in the case of each of
clause (i) and (ii), required by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law. At all times since the original offering of equity interests
in such KA Fund, each of the Fund Reports and the Offering Materials of the KA
Funds, and any supplemental advertising and marketing materials relating to a
KA Fund prepared by any KA Entity (i) has complied in all material respects
with applicable Law, and (ii) has not contained any untrue statement of a
material fact, or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially
misleading, in each such case at such time any such Fund Report, Offering
Material or other material was delivered to investors or potential investors
in such KA Fund.

payable by such Public Fund under the applicable Management Agreement, each as
of the date of such annual report.

 



 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 4.9(h) of the __KA Disclosure Schedule_ ,
(i) no KA Fund (pursuant to its Organizational Documents, Offering Materials
or otherwise) prevents or restricts any KA Entity from launching a similar KA
Fund at any time or prior to any Event, other than any restriction (A) that
has expired prior to the date hereof or (B) relating to launching a successive
fund as set forth in its Organizational Documents or Offering Materials, and
(ii) no KA Entity or KA Fund is subject to any priority or exclusivity
arrangements with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities.

 



 

(i) _Annex G_ sets forth a complete and correct list, as of March 31, 2015,
organized by Client, of (i) with respect to each KA Fund, its jurisdiction of
formation, (ii) the name of each KA Fund Investor, KA Fund GP and "special
limited partner" of each KA Fund, (iii) the original capital commitment and
unpaid capital commitment (i.e., unfunded capital commitment plus the amount
that is callable pursuant to recycling provisions, if any) for each such KA
Fund Investor, and the aggregate capital commitments and unpaid capital
commitments for each KA Fund or, for KA Funds that are hedge funds or other
open-end funds (other than sub-advisory accounts), the net asset value
attributable to each KA Fund Investor therein, (iv) the AUM and the Fee
Earning AUM Managed for each Client, (v) the management fee rate in effect
with respect to such KA Fund (or, if different, each KA Fund Investor
therein), (vi) the percentage used to calculate the Carried Interest for each
Client (or, if different, each KA Fund Investor therein), (vii) the amount of
Carried Interest paid to any KA Entity by each Client since January 1, 2013
and the Accrued Carried Interest , (viii) all "clawback" and similar Liability
of the KA Entities (or any direct or indirect owner thereof) that has accrued
or is payable in respect of each Client and (ix) any escrow, hold back or
similar account or amounts maintained or held by or on behalf of each Client
(or a KA Entity in respect of such Client) in respect of any "clawback" or
similar Liability. Since March 31, 2015, there have been no (A) material
changes to the information set forth in _Annex G_ or (B) redemptions of AUM or
of assets under management for any Client. The calculation of Management Fees,
Carried Interest and Accrued Carried Interest for each Client has been made in
accordance with the applicable Organizational Documents, Management Agreements
and Sideletters. Since January 1, 2015, no KA Fund Investor (x) has been
designated by a KA Fund as a "defaulting investor" or (y) is or has been in
default in the making of any capital contribution or other payment to a KA
Fund, except in the case of this clause (y), for such defaults by all KA Fund
Investors that do not in the aggregate

 



      
 

 



 

exceed $1,000,000 or defaults that have been cured within 30 days of such
default. No KA Fund Investor is in material breach of its obligations under
any Organizational Document or Sideletter.

 



 

(j) No Public Fund has adopted any 12b-1 Plan. Each of the Public Funds has a
separate prime broker, custodian or trustee which is a third party entity
independent of the KA Entities undertaking asset management services for the
KA Funds.

 



 

(k) Since January 1, 2013, with respect to each account for each Client
maintained by any KA Entity that is responsible for pricing, there has not
existed any material unremedied "out of balance" condition, pricing error or
similar condition.

 



 

(l) Each "soft dollar" arrangement to which a KA Entity has been a party is in
compliance with the safe harbor of Section 28(e) under the Exchange Act and
all other applicable Laws. At the time each KA Fund Investor entered into a
subscription Contract with a KA Fund (or acquired an interest in a KA Fund by
assignment or otherwise), either (i) such KA Fund Investor represented to a KA
Entity that it was, or (ii) the applicable KA Entity had reason to believe
that such KA Fund Investor was, (A) an "accredited investor" as defined in
Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act and (B)
either (x) a Qualified Client or (y) a "knowledgeable employee," in case of
clause (B), to the extent any KA Entity receives Carried Interest with respect
to such KA Fund.

 



 

(m) Since January 1, 2013, the KA Entities and the KA Funds have been in
compliance in all material respects with (i) all applicable data protection
and privacy Laws and (ii) all privacy and related policies, programs and other
written notices that concern any KA Entitys or KA Funds collection or use of
personal information.

 



 

(n) Since January 1, 2013, (a) no Public Fund has (i) received any written
notice from any Person (each, a " **Contesting Party** ") that such Contesting
Party has an intent to change or influence the control of such Public Fund or
participate in a transaction having that effect (including an unsolicited bid)
as described in Rule 13d-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act or (ii) been engaged
in, or the subject of, a proxy contest or similar activity and (b) to the
Knowledge of any KA Entity, no Contesting Party has filed a Schedule 13D that
disclosed any plan or proposal or other intent to change or influence control
over any Public Fund.

of the KA Entities), and no assets of any KA Entity, KA Fund or Subsidiary of
a KA Fund are considered "plan assets" within the meaning of ERISA or other
applicable Law. Since January 1, 2012, there have been no prohibited
transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within
the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Benefits
Plans that could result in any Liability or excise Tax under ERISA or the Code

2012 in which the assets of any KA Fund were deemed to constitute "plan
assets" for purposes of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, the KA
Entities and KA Funds complied in all material respects with the applicable
indicia of ownership and bonding requirements of Sections 404(b) and 412 of
ERISA.

Code, each KA Entity, KA Fund and their respective ERISA Affiliates has, since
January 1, 2012, complied in all material respects with Section 4980B of the

through a voluntary employees beneficiary association (within the meaning of
subsection 501(c)(9) of the Code) or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code). No KA Entity, KA Fund

applicable Law.

 



 

(h) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of any KA Entity, threatened
Action relating to a Benefit Plan (other than routine claims for benefits)

or an application or filing under, and no KA Entity or KA Fund is or is

correction or similar program.

 



 

(i) Each individual that renders services to any KA Entity or KA Fund who is
classified by such KA Entity or KA Fund, as applicable, as (i) an independent
contractor or other non-employee status or (ii) an exempt or non-exempt
employee, is properly so classified for all purposes, including for purposes
of (A) sponsorship of any Benefit Plans and (B) all applicable Laws, except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability.

 



 

(j) Other than the Organizational Documents of the applicable KA Entity, no KA
Entity or KA Fund is subject to any (i) Contract with any partner, member,
manager, director, officer or other employee or consultant (A) the benefits of
which are contingent either alone or in combination with any other Event
(e.g., termination of employment), or the terms of which will be materially
altered (including accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase in
the amount of value of any compensation, payment or benefit), upon the
occurrence of a transaction involving any KA Entity or KA Fund of the nature
of any of the Transactions, (B) providing any term of employment or
compensation guarantee or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits
after the termination of employment of such Person or (ii) Contract, the value
of any benefits under which shall be calculated on the basis of any of the
Transactions. The Transactions will not (either alone or in connection with
any other Events), result in any payment that would constitute an "excess
parachute payment" for purposes of Section 280G or 4999 of the Code. Each
Benefit Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan" within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated since January 1, 2012,
in compliance in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code. No
Benefit Plan provides any individual with an indemnification, "gross up" or
similar payment in respect of any Taxes that may become payable under Section
409A or Section 4999 of the Code or under applicable Law.

 



 

(k) Other than as specifically contemplated by the Transaction Documents, no
KA Entity or KA Fund is subject to any contractual, equitable or other
obligation to, or has made any commitments to any Person to, in the future,
establish, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan or to, in the future, make any
change to any employees or individual independent contractors remuneration,
except in each such case as required by the terms of any such Benefit Plan or
applicable Laws.

Consent under, any Law to which any Buyer Affiliate or any of its assets is
subject, (c) conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default under,
result in the acceleration of any right or obligation under, require any
notice or Consent under, or create in any Person the right to accelerate,

Contract or Permit to which any Buyer Affiliate is a party or subject to or to
which any of its assets is subject or (d) result in the creation of a Lien on
any of its assets, except, in the case of clauses (c) and (d), to the extent

(d) Since January 1, 2013, each Buyer Affiliate has held all Permits that are
necessary for it to lawfully conduct its operations and own, lease and operate
its assets and each such Permit has been in full force and effect, except for
any Permits the absence of which, or the lack of full force and effect of
which, would not result in an Ares Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1,
2013, each Buyer Affiliate has been in compliance with each such Permit,
except for any such noncompliance that would not result in an Ares Material
Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2013, no Buyer Affiliate has received written

any Permit that has had or would result in an Ares Material Adverse Effect,
and to the Knowledge of the Buyers, no revocation, suspension, modification or

disqualification would not result in an Ares Material Adverse Effect. There is
no Action pending or, to the Knowledge of the Buyers, threatened, that could
reasonably be expected to result in, or provide the basis for, such
ineligibility or disqualification, except, to the extent any such
ineligibility or disqualification would not result in an Ares Material Adverse
Effect.

and Blocked Persons."

 **5.6.** **_SEC Reports; Financial Statements_**.

 



 

(a) Ares Management has timely filed with or furnished to, as applicable, the
SEC the Ares Management SEC Documents. As of their respective filing dates
(or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of the date of the
last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date hereof), each of
the Ares Management SEC Documents (i) complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(a) Ares Management is properly classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, and not as an association or a publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation under Section 7704 of the Code, and has
been properly treated as such since its existence as a separate entity was
recognized for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Ares Management has proper
procedures and controls in place, and has operated in accordance with such
procedures and controls, as to ensure that at least 90% of its gross income
for the taxable year ending on December 31, 2014, and for the calendar quarter
ending on March 31, 2015, has consisted of "qualifying income" within the
meaning of Section 7704(d).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of AH LP, Ares Domestic, AI LP, and Ares Real Estate has always been
properly treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as either (i) a
partnership that is not a publicly traded partnership treated as a corporation
under Section 7704(a) of the Code, or (ii) an entity disregarded as separate
from its owner. Ares Real Estate Parent has been organized and operated in
conformity in all material respects with the requirements for qualification as
a REIT under the Code, and its proposed method of operation will enable it to
be qualified as a REIT under the Code for its taxable years ending December
31, 2015 and thereafter (or through its termination, if earlier). Each
Subsidiary of Ares Real Estate Parent that is a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, other than any qualified REIT subsidiary as defined in
Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, has been in compliance in all material respects
with all requirements applicable to a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the
meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code and all applicable Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Each Ares RIC has been organized and operated in conformity in all
material respects with the requirements for qualification as a RIC under the
Code, and its proposed method of operation will enable it to be qualified as a
RIC under the Code for its taxable years ending December 31, 2015 and
thereafter.

 



 

(c) All Tax Returns required to have been filed by Ares Management, each Ares
Operating Group Entity, Ares Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent, and each
Ares Fund have been duly and timely filed (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of time in which to make such filings), and all such Tax Returns
are complete and correct in all material respects. With respect to any period
or portion thereof for which Tax Returns have not yet been filed, or for which
Taxes are not yet due or owing, Ares Management, each Ares Operating Group
Entity, Ares Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent and each Ares Fund have
established due and sufficient reserves for the payment of such Taxes in
accordance with GAAP and all other applicable generally accepted accounting
standard for non-U.S. purposes.

 



 

(d) All Taxes that have become due and payable by Ares Management, each Ares
Operating Group Entity, Ares Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent and each
Ares Fund have been fully and timely paid when due. There are no Liens as a
result of any unpaid Taxes (other than current Taxes not yet due and payable)
upon any of the assets of Ares Management, an Ares Operating Group Entity,
Ares Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent or each Ares Fund.

 



 

(e) No material deficiencies for Taxes with respect to Ares Management, an
Ares Operating Group Entity, Ares Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent or an
Ares Fund have been proposed in writing or assessed by any Tax authority.
There are no outstanding, pending or, to the Knowledge of Buyers, threatened
Tax proceedings in respect of Ares Management, an Ares Operating Group Entity,
Ares Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent or an Ares Fund. There is no
outstanding waiver by Ares Management, an Ares Operating Group Entity, Ares
Holdings Parent, Ares Domestic Parent or an Ares Fund of any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes of such Person.

 



 

(f) None of Ares Management, an Ares Operating Group Entity, Ares Holdings
Parent, Ares Domestic Parent or an Ares Fund have engaged in any transaction
that is a "reportable transaction" (other than a "loss transaction" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4(b)(5)) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4.

 



      
 

 



 

 **5.9.** **_Benefits Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Each Ares Benefit Plan (i) is in compliance in all material respects with
applicable Law and (ii) has, since January 1, 2012, been administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and applicable Law. Each Ares
Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified, the trust required to be maintained thereunder is
exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code and since January 1,
2012, to the Knowledge of Buyers, no event has occurred (whether by an action
or a failure to act) that would reasonably be expected to result in the
disqualification of such Ares Benefit Plan or the loss of tax exempt status of
such trust.

 



 

(b) No Buyer Affiliate or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has now or
at any time since January 1, 2012, contributed to, sponsored or maintained a

breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of
Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Ares Benefits Plans,
except, for any such transactions or breaches as would not result in an Ares
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) Each Ares Benefit Plan that is a "non-qualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been operated since
January 1, 2012 in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, except for any
such noncompliance as would not result in an Ares Material Adverse Effect.

reasonably adequate insurance coverage for the Buyer Affiliates and the Ares
Funds, as applicable, in accordance with customary industry practice.

as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act

and _ARTICLE IV_ and the other representations and warranties of the KA

any instrument or certificate delivered hereunder, no KA Owner, KA Party or
Representative of a KA Owner or KA Party has made, and the Buyers have not

days with respect to each quarter thereafter), the KA Parties shall (i)
deliver

 



      
 

 



 

to the Buyers complete and correct copies of the Post-Signing Financial
Statements and the Pro Forma Financial Statements as of, and for, such fiscal

their Subsidiaries to, adopt and execute such amendments to the 401(k) Plan,
if any, as reasonably requested by the Buyers.

 



 

(c) Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause each Ares
Benefit Plan providing benefits to Continuing Employees after the Closing (the
" **New Plans** ") to waive waiting periods for each Continuing Employee to
the extent coverage under such New Plan is replacing coverage under a Benefit
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Closing (such plans, the " **Old Plans** ") and (ii) ensure that each
Continuing Employee is provided with full credit for service with the KA
Entities, other than with respect to any leaves of absence that extended six
months or more, for eligibility and vesting purposes with respect to any New
Plan that is applicable to hired, active employees to the same extent such
Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to such service credit
under a corresponding Old Plan, except with respect to the vesting of the
employer contributions in any Ares Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code. For purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to a Continuing Employee, Buyers
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan for
each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions are prohibited by applicable legal requirements or were
inapplicable or waived under the corresponding Old Plan, and (ii) cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing

 



      
 

 



 

Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the corresponding Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees
participation in the New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(d) Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide each
Continuing Employee who has elected to participate in a health or dental
flexible spending account plan maintained by a KA Entity or KA Fund with
coverage under such plan, or a similar plan maintained by Buyer, through the
end of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

 



 

(e) Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that an Ares
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
promptly accepts elective "roll overs" of each Continuing Employees entire
vested account balances (including any outstanding loans) under any Benefit
Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code to the extent
such rollover is permitted by the applicable Benefit Plans.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) create
any third party beneficiary rights in any Person or confer upon any Continuing
Employee or legal representative or beneficiary thereof any rights or remedies
of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of the Transaction
Documents, including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period, or level of compensation or benefits, (ii) be deemed to
amend, establish or modify any Benefit Plan or Ares Benefit Plan or (iii)
limit the ability of any Buyer Affiliate to amend, modify or terminate in
accordance with its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement, contract, policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established,
sponsored or maintained by any Buyer Affiliate.

any Liabilities, or otherwise take any action, other than (i) with the prior
written consent of the Buyers in accordance with the Buyer Affiliates
compliance policies, (ii) in connection with the Transactions, (iii) with
respect to the maintenance of (A) its existence, (B) the balance sheet
investments and other assets set forth on _Annex O_ , (C) the KA RetainCo
Reimbursement Agreement and the KA RetainCo

 



      
 

 



 

Services Agreement and (D) the Investment Funds set forth on _Annex P_ or (iv)
as set forth in the Transaction Documents or (b) use the back offices,
systems, employees or assets of the Business, other than as expressly

efforts to enter into the KA RetainCo Services Agreement on or prior to the

Buyer Affiliate and KA RetainCo jointly beneficially own an interest in such
Group 1 Fund in accordance with the " _Target Ownership Percentage_ " set
forth on _Section 6.19 of the KA Disclosure Schedule_. All capital
contributions to a Group 1 Fund after the Closing shall be funded by KA
RetainCo and the applicable Buyer Affiliate in accordance with their
applicable Target Ownership Percentage. From and after the Closing, all
distributions by a Group 1 Fund that otherwise would be made to KA RetainCo
and Buyer Affiliate shall be made to them according to their applicable Target
Ownership Percentage, without regard to any prior distributions made before
the Closing.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, all capital calls by a Group 2 Fund as set
forth on _Section 6.19 of the KA Disclosure Schedule_ in respect of a
Designated Commitment shall be funded 100% by the applicable Buyer Affiliate,
and such Buyer Affiliate shall be entitled to 100% of the distributions from
such Group 2 Fund. For purposes of this _Section 6.19(b)_, Kayne Anderson
Real Estate Partners IV, L.P. shall be treated as a Group 2 Fund, and it shall
be purchased at the Closing by a Buyer Affiliate for an amount equal to the
capital contributed by KA RetainCo.

 



 

(c) No Buyer Affiliate shall have any obligation to fund, or cause the funding
of, any remaining capital commitments with respect to the investment
commitments listed under Group 3 as set forth on _Section 6.19 of the KA
Disclosure Schedule_. Each of such commitments shall be transferred to KA
RetainCo in connection with the Equity Restructuring; _provided_ that upon the

the interest in a Group 3 Fund held by KA RetainCo.

following conditions:

making illegal the consummation of the Transactions or the operation of the

Agreement may rely, as a basis for terminating this Agreement, on the failure
of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_, _7.2_ or _7.3_ , as the case may
be, to be satisfied, if such failure was caused by such partys breach of any
provision of this Agreement or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts

terminated prior to the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) by written consent of the Buyers and the Sellers Representative;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) by written notice of the Buyers or the Sellers Representative to the
other party, if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an Order or taken
any other Action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting
the Transactions and such Order or other Action shall have become final and
nonappealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.1(b)_ in respect of such Order or Action shall not be
available to the party that has directly or indirectly solicited or encouraged
the adoption of any such Order or Action;

 



 

(c) by written notice of the Buyers or the Sellers Representative to the
other party, if the Transactions shall not have been consummated on or before
the Outside Date (other than due to the failure of the party providing such
notice to perform any obligations under this Agreement required to be
performed by it at or prior to the Closing or to satisfy any Closing condition
and other than due to the failure to be satisfied of any condition set forth
in _Section 7.1_ or _7.2_ that by its nature will be satisfied on the Closing
Date);

 



 

(d) by written notice of the Buyers to the Sellers Representative if the KA
Owners or the KA Parties shall have breached or failed to perform any of their
respective representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
contained herein and such breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to
the failure of any of the conditions specified in _Section 7.1(a)_ or _(b)_
and (ii) is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, has not
been cured within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof from the
Buyers; or

 



 

(e) by written notice of the Sellers Representative to the Buyers, if the
Buyers shall have breached or failed to perform any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained herein
and such breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the failure of
any of the conditions specified in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _(b)_ and (ii) is
incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, has not been cured by
the Buyers within 30 days after receipt of written notice thereof from the
Sellers Representative.

 



 

 **8.2.** **_Effect of Termination_** **.** In the event of termination of
this Agreement by either the Sellers Representative or the Buyers as provided
in _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no
effect, without any Liability on the part of any party; _provided_ that the
provisions of _ARTICLE XI_ and _ARTICLE XII_ and this _Section 8.2_ shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to _Section 8.1_. Nothing contained
in this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve any party hereto of any Liability that it
may have for (a) any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement prior to any termination pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ or (b) fraud.

(i) each KA Owner shall severally and not jointly indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnitees against any and all Losses suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, directly
or indirectly resulting from or arising out of (A) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by such KA Owner in _ARTICLE III_ or (B) any
failure by such KA Owner to perform any of its Pre-Closing Covenants; and

 



 

(ii) each KA Owner shall severally and not jointly, in accordance with its Pro
Rata Percentage, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees
against any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or
to which any of them becomes subject, directly or indirectly resulting from or
arising out of (A) any breach of any representation or warranty made by any KA
Party in _ARTICLE IV_ (other than _Section 4.7_), (B) any failure by a KA
Entity to perform any of its Pre-Closing Covenants or (C) any Specified
Matter.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification by Buyers_. From and after the Closing, subject to
_Section 12.1_ and _Section 9.3_, the Buyers shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the KA Indemnitees against any and all Losses suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them or to which any of them become subject, directly
or indirectly resulting from or arising out of (i) any breach of the Ares
Public Disclosure Representations or any Fundamental Representation made by
the Buyers in _ARTICLE V_ or (ii) any failure by a Buyer to perform any of
its Pre-Closing Covenants.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Section 12.15_ and the last sentence of this
_Section 9.1(c)_, from and after the Closing, (i) the indemnification
provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE IX_ and _ARTICLE X_ are the sole and
exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to any and all rights, claims and
causes of action arising out of, or relating to, any breach of any
representation, warranty, or Pre-Closing Covenant set forth herein and (ii)
each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and
all rights, claims and causes of action arising out of, or relating to, any
breach of any representation, warranty, or Pre-Closing Covenant set forth
herein it may have against the other parties hereto, their Affiliates and
their and their Affiliates respective Representatives, except pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE IX_ or _ARTICLE X_.
This _Section 9.1(c)_ shall not preclude any party from seeking any remedy,
or asserting any right, claim or cause of action, with respect to (i) fraud or
(ii) any Post-Closing Covenant.

 



      
 

 



 

 **9.2.** **_Method of Asserting Claims_**.

 



 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(i) If an Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity with respect to a Third-
Party Claim, then such Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice to
the Indemnifying Party promptly after receipt of written notice of such Third-
Party Claim; _provided_ that any failure to give such notice promptly will not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder
unless and only to the extent that (i) such failure results in a lack of
actual notice and (ii) the Indemnifying Party is actually materially
prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after
receipt of an Indemnity Notice to assume the conduct and control, through
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense of such Third-Party
Claim; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party (A) shall permit the Indemnified
Party to participate in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by
such Indemnified Party and, except as provided in clause (ii) below, the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party and (B)
may assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim only to the extent the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges its indemnity obligation hereunder.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (i), the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim and
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel (reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnifying Party) retained by the Indemnified Party if (A) the Third-
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Action,
indictment or allegation, (B) the Third-Party Claim seeks a material
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (C) the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party, (D) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an
adverse determination with respect to the Third-Party Claim is likely to
establish a precedential custom or practice or would otherwise be materially
detrimental to or materially injure the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates,
(E) the Indemnified Party is a Buyer Indemnitee and the Third-Party Claim
involves a Client or KA Fund Investor, (F) the Indemnifying Party fails,
within 30 days after receiving an Indemnity Notice, to assume the defense of
the Third-Party Claim in accordance with this _Section 9.2(a)_ or (G) the
Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend
such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party assumes control of the
defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel with respect
to such Third-Party Claim and to participate in the defense thereof, and the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party,
except that the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall be borne by
the Indemnifying Party if (x) the payment of such counsels fees and expenses
has been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, or (y)
the named parties in such Third-Party Claim (including any impleaded parties)
include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its counsel that (1) there are
one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are not
available to the Indemnifying Party, or the assertion of which would be
adverse to or in conflict with the interests of the Indemnifying Party, or (2)
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be otherwise
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct. If the
Indemnifying Party does not assume control of the defense of the Third Party

 



      
 

 



 

Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such Third-Party
Claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall have consented in writing to such
payment or settlement (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned); _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such Third-Party Claim without
such consent from the Indemnifying Party if (i) the Indemnified Party agrees
in writing to waive any right to indemnity by the Indemnifying Party for such
Third-Party Claim or (ii) the Indemnifying Party assumes control but fails to
vigorously defend a Third Party Claim.

 



 

(iii) If the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to assume control of the
defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with the terms of this _Section
9.2(a)_, or the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the defense thereof but
thereafter fails to defend the Third-Party Claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
Third-Party Claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor
pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement or consent
to entry of any judgment, in each case, unless such settlement or consent does
not contain any admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the
Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, is entirely indemnifiable by the
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_ or _Section 10.4_, and
includes as an unconditional written term thereof the giving by the Person or
Persons asserting such Third-Party Claim to all Indemnified Parties of an
unconditional release from all Liability with respect to such Third-Party
Claim. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including making available records relating to such Third-
Party Claim and furnishing, without expense to the Indemnifying Party, such
employees of the Indemnified Party reasonably necessary for the preparation of
the defense of such Third-Party Claim or for testimony as witnesses in any
proceeding relating to such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that (A) such
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the business of the non-
requesting party, (B) nothing herein shall require any Indemnified Party to
waive any attorney-client privilege or attorneys duty of confidentiality or
confidential treatment and (C) the obligations set forth in this sentence
shall be null and void and of no force and effect whatsoever if such
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable
likelihood exists of a material conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Party and such Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) _Non-Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party has a claim under
_Section 9.1_ or _Section 10.4_ against any Indemnifying Party that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity
Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The failure or
delay by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair
such Indemnified Partys rights hereunder except to the extent that (i) such
failure results in a lack of actual notice and (ii) the Indemnifying Party is
actually materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. If the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the claim
described in such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party
within the 30 day period following receipt of an Indemnity Notice that it
disputes the claim described in such Indemnity Notice, the Loss identified in
the Indemnity Notice will be conclusively deemed an indemnifiable Loss
pursuant to _Section 9.1_ or _Section 10.4_, as applicable, and the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss to the Indemnified Party
on demand. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its Liability with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations within the 30 day period following receipt by
the Indemnified Party of notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes its
Liability with respect to such Loss, such dispute shall be resolved in
accordance with _Section 12.9_.

 



 

(c) _Sellers  Representative_. The Sellers Representative shall act on
behalf of the KA Owners with respect to all claims pursuant to _Article IX_
(other than pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)(i)_) or _Section 10.4_.

 



 

 **9.3.** **_Further Items Relating to Indemnification_** **.**
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof:

 



 

(a) No KA Owner shall have any indemnification obligation pursuant to (i)
_Section 9.1(a)(i)(A)_ or _9.1(a)(ii)(A)_ until the aggregate Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Sections 9.1(a)(i)(A)_ and
_9.1(a)(ii)(A)_ exceed the Basket, after which the Buyer Indemnitees will be
indemnified only for such Losses in excess of the Basket. The aggregate
indemnification obligation of each KA Owner under _Sections 9.1(a)(i)(A)_ and
_9.1(a)(ii)(A)_ shall in no event exceed such KA Owners Pro Rata Percentage
of the KA General Cap. No Buyer shall have any indemnification obligation
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ until the aggregate Losses incurred by the KA
Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ exceed the Basket, after which
the KA Indemnitees will be indemnified only for such Losses in excess of the
Basket. The aggregate indemnification obligation of the Buyers under _Section
9.1(b)(i)_ shall in no event exceed the Buyer General Cap. The limitations set
forth in this _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not apply to Losses related to breaches
of any Fundamental Representations.

 



 

(b) The aggregate indemnification obligation of each KA Owner under this
Agreement shall in no event exceed such KA Owners Pro Rata Percentage of the
KA Absolute Cap.

 



 

(c) The aggregate indemnification obligation of the Buyers under this
Agreement shall in no event exceed the Buyer Absolute Cap.

 



 

(d) For purposes of determining the amount of Losses recoverable pursuant to
this _ARTICLE IX_ and _Section 10.4_, but not for determining whether a
breach has occurred, all qualifications as to materiality, "Ares Material
Adverse Effect", "KA Material Adverse Effect", "Material Fund Change",
"Portfolio Company Material Adverse Effect" or other similar qualifier
contained in any representation or warranty (other than the Listing
Representations) shall be disregarded.

 



 

(e) No party hereto shall have any Liability to any other party for any
remote, speculative or punitive damages, except, in each case, with respect to
Third-Party Claims if such damages are paid to a third party.

 



 

(f) For all applicable tax purposes, the parties shall (i) treat any indemnity
payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Total Consideration
(other than the portion of the Total Consideration that represents amounts
distributed in the Debt-Financed

 



      
 

 



 

Distribution) for the applicable KA Interests and (ii) report such payments
consistent therewith, in each case, to the extent permitted under applicable
Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, after consultation with Sellers
Representative and its Representatives, Buyers Tax Return preparer advises
that it cannot adopt such reporting position on the applicable Buyers Tax
Return at a "more likely than not" standard, the parties shall adopt such
treatment and reporting position as is advised by the Buyers Tax Return
preparer.

 



 

(g) The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder shall be
calculated after giving effect to any insurance proceeds actually received by
an indemnitee on account of such Loss, net of out-of-pocket costs, fees, Taxes
and expenses in procuring any such recovery (including deductibles,
retrospective premium adjustments and premium increases). If an applicable
indemnitee receives an insurance recovery or indemnification payment with
respect to any Loss for which such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then
it shall refund to, or cause to be refunded to, the applicable Indemnifying
Party an amount equal to the aggregate amount of such recovery or payment (net
of the out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses paid to third parties and Taxes
related thereto).

 



 

(h) To the extent that any Losses were included in calculating the Closing
Indebtedness or the Working Capital amount reflected in the Final Base Cash
Consideration, no Buyer Indemnitee may recover such Losses through an
indemnification claim pursuant to this _ARTICLE IX_.

 



 

 **9.4.** **_Satisfaction of KA Owner Indemnification and Payment
Obligations_**.

 



 

(a) A Buyer Indemnitee may recover the amount of Losses determined to be
payable to such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of any KA Owners indemnification
obligations hereunder (including under _Section 10.4_) and amounts
outstanding under _Section 2.6(b)(iv)(B)_ not timely paid by KA RetainCo, (x)
directly from the applicable KA Owner, (y) by cancellation of the Indemnity
Equity Amount of such KA Owners (or its Permitted Transferees) Ares Equity
Interests or (z) via offset from one or more of the following sources (and in
any order as may be determined by a Buyer Indemnitee in its discretion):

 



 

(i) any amounts to be distributed to such KA Owner (or any Permitted
Transferee thereof) by any Buyer Affiliate (whether or not such right of set
off is specifically provided for in the applicable Organizational Documents)
with respect to such KA Owners (or such other Persons) Ares Equity
Interests, as applicable;

 



 

(ii) any amounts payable (whether as a guaranteed payment, draw or otherwise
(other than (x) compensation in the form of base salary or (y) reimbursement
or advancement of expenses)) to such KA Owner by any Buyer Affiliate,
including amounts payable as (A) compensation or (B) a performance fee,
performance allocations, carried interest or other performance-based payments;
and

 



 

(iii) any amounts owed to, or on behalf of, such KA Owner under this Agreement
or under any of the other Transaction Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each KA Owner, on its behalf and on behalf of its Permitted Transferees
and their respective heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns,
authorizes each Buyer Indemnitee and its Affiliates to cause any such
cancellation or offset to be effected with respect to such KA Owner;
_provided_ that (i) such KA Owner is provided written notice specifying the
amount and nature of any such offset pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_ and (ii) no
Buyer Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates may cancel any KA Owners (or its
Permitted Transferees) Ares Equity Interests pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)(y)_
unless such KA Owner (A) has been provided written notice by a Buyer
Indemnitee or its Affiliate that it intends to cancel the Indemnity Equity
Amount of such KA Owners Ares Equity Interests pursuant to _Section
9.4(a)(y)_ and (B) fails to pay in full its indemnification obligations
hereunder in cash within 30 days after delivery of such notice. To the extent
any indemnification obligation of a KA Owner is satisfied via cancellation or
offset pursuant to _Section 9.4(a)_, such KA Owner shall be deemed (x) to
have received the amount so offset as a distribution or payment, as
applicable, and (y) have paid such amount offset, or tendered the Indemnity
Equity Amount cancelled, to the Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such
indemnification obligation.

 



 

(c) Each Buyer Indemnitee and its Affiliates may withhold any amount or
restrict the transfer of Ares Equity Interests (in an amount not to exceed the
alleged amount of the indemnification obligation set forth in any Indemnity
Notice delivered pursuant to _Section 9.2_, or if no such amount is set forth
thereon, the Buyers reasonable, good faith estimation of the potential amount
of such indemnification obligation) described in _Section_ _ 9.4(a)_ that is
otherwise distributable, payable or owed (as applicable) to, or owned by, such
KA Owner (or its Permitted Transferees) after the time that a Buyer Indemnitee
has given a notice of indemnification under _Section 9.2_ but prior to the
rendering of a settlement, judgment or arbitral decision establishing or
denying (or reducing) the indemnification obligation of such KA Owner until
the time of such settlement, judgment or arbitral decision and (i) if such
settlement, judgment or arbitral decision establishes the indemnification
obligation of such KA Owner, (A) the Person holding such withheld amount may
promptly pay over a portion of the withheld amount equal to the
indemnification obligation (or such entire withheld amount if equal to or less
than the indemnification obligation) to the applicable Buyer Indemnitee and
(B) the Person restricting the transfer of the Ares Equity Interests may
cancel the Indemnity Equity Amount of such KA Owners (or its Permitted
Transferees) Ares Equity Interests and (ii) if such settlement, judgment or
arbitral decision denies (or reduces) the indemnification obligation of such
KA Owner, (A) the Person holding such withheld amount shall promptly release
the portion of the amounts so withheld in excess of such determined
indemnification obligation to such KA Owner and (B) the Person restricting the
transfer of the Ares Equity Interests shall cease to restrict such transfer
pursuant to this _Section 9.4_, in each case, to the extent it is determined
(whether by settlement, judgment or arbitral decision) that such amounts are
required to be so released or to cease to be so restricted.

 



       
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE X**

 



 

 **TAX MATTERS**

 



 

 **10.1.** **_Tax Returns_**.

 



 

(a) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. The Sellers Representative shall prepare and
timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, (A) all Tax Returns of
the KA Entities and the KA Funds that are required to be filed (taking into
account extensions) prior to the Closing Date and (B) all income Tax Returns
of the KA Entities for Tax periods that end on or prior to the Closing Date
that are required to be filed (taking into account extensions) on or after the
Closing Date, including KAFA and KACALPs federal information returns on IRS
Form 1065 and analogous state information returns for the tax year of KAFA,
KACALP and their respective Subsidiaries that will end prior to or as of the
close of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Other Tax Returns_. The Buyers shall cause to be prepared and timely
filed all other Tax Returns of the KA Parties and their Subsidiaries and all
Tax Returns of the KA Funds required to be filed after the Closing Date. Any
Tax Return to be prepared and filed by the Buyers after the Closing Date for
Tax periods beginning before the Closing Date that would reflect a Tax
Liability for a KA Entity or KA Fund in respect of which the KA Owners may
become obligated to make any indemnity payment pursuant to _Section 10.4_
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with the last previous similar Tax
Return, if Buyers reasonably determine that treatment of Tax items or
positions on such previous Tax Return are sustainable at a "more likely than
not" standard. The Buyers shall provide the Sellers Representative with a
copy of such proposed Tax Return (and such additional information regarding
such Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by the Sellers Representative,
including any workpapers) at least 30 days, or such shorter period as is
reasonable based on the filing deadline, prior to the filing of such Tax
Return. The Buyers shall consult with the Sellers Representative concerning
such Tax Return and the Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall use good
faith efforts to resolve any dispute regarding the preparation of any such Tax
Return.

 



 

 **10.2.** **_Cooperation_**. The Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall
cooperate in the preparation of Tax Returns of the KA Parties, their
Subsidiaries and the KA Funds and the conduct of any Tax Action involving the
KA Parties, any of their Subsidiaries and the KA Funds. Such cooperation shall
include (i) furnishing powers of attorney or other authorizations or
assistance necessary for the party responsible for controlling a Tax Action or
filing a Tax Return, and (ii) furnishing prior years Tax Returns and such
other information within such partys possession as is relevant to the
preparation of such Tax Returns or the conduct of such Tax Action.

 



 

 **10.3.** **_Transfer Taxes_**. The Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of the KA Owners), on the other hand, shall each
bear 50% of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, real
property transfer, real property withholding, controlling interest transfer
and other similar Taxes and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other
fees and charges (" **Transfer Taxes** ") incurred as a result of the
Transactions (including the Equity Restructuring, but excluding the transfer
of any equity interests or other assets of KA RetainCo or its Subsidiaries)
when due. The Sellers Representative (on behalf of

 



      
 

 



 

the KA Owners) shall bear 100% of any Transfer Taxes incurred as a result of
the transfer of any equity interests or other assets of KA RetainCo or its
Subsidiaries. The Buyers shall prepare any Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes, and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate with the
Buyers in the preparation of such Tax Returns. The Sellers Representative and
the Buyers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Transfer
Taxes to the extent such efforts do not impose any commercially unreasonable
cost or other adverse effect on such party or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

 **10.4.** **_Tax Indemnification_**.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to _Section 12.1_ and _Sections
9.3(b)_ and _9.3(d)_ through _(h)_ , each KA Owner shall severally and not
jointly, in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Buyer Indemnitees against any and all Losses suffered,
incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject,
resulting from, arising out of or relating to: (i) Taxes (or the non-payment
thereof) of each KA Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (determined in
accordance with _Section 10.4(b)_ hereof) (including for the avoidance of
doubt, any Taxes (A) resulting from the Equity Restructuring or (B) that
should have been withheld by any KA Entity in connection with amounts paid to
any Person (including an employee or independent contractor)), (ii) Taxes of
KA RetainCo or its Subsidiaries for any period, (iii) any breach of any
representation or warranty made by any KA Party in _Section 4.7_, (iv) any
failure by any KA Party to perform any of its Pre-Closing Covenants with
respect to Tax matters or (v) Taxes that are the responsibility of the
Sellers Representative determined in accordance with _Section 10.3_. The
disclosure of any Liability for or relating to any Tax on any section of the
KA Disclosure Schedule does not relieve the indemnification obligations
arising under _Sections 10.4(a)(i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iv)_ or _(v)_ with respect
to such disclosed Liability.

 



 

(b) The parties shall, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, elect
with the relevant Taxing authority for all Tax purposes to treat the Closing
Date as the last day of the taxable period of the KA Parties and their
Subsidiaries. Where not so permitted, in the case of any Straddle Period of a
KA Party or its Subsidiary, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be, (i) in the case of Taxes that are not based
on income or receipts, the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in
the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, such as real property
Taxes, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
_multiplied by_ a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the Straddle Period and (ii) in all other cases, the
amount that would be payable if the taxable year or period ended on and
included the Closing Date.

 



 

 **10.5.** **_Certain Post-Closing Actions_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing, the Buyers shall not effect
a disposition of any of the KA Interests or any material asset of either of
the KA Parties if such disposition would result in an allocation of built-in
gain to any KA Owner under Section 704(c) of the Code, without first obtaining
consent from the Sellers Representative, unless the applicable Buyer
Affiliate waives restrictions on the sale or exchange of Ares Operating Group
Units (together with any prior waivers) to provide each applicable KA Owner
sufficient liquidity

 



      
 

 



 

(determined after considering all Ares Equity Interests of such KA Owner not
subject at such time to any lock up period) to pay the income taxes on gains
allocated to such KA Owner from such disposition under Section 704(c) of the
Code. The Buyers shall use the "traditional method" of making Code Section
704(c) allocations provided by Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(b) and the
principles of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-3(a)(9) with respect to the
KA Interests and the assets of the KA Parties.

 



 

(b) Prior to the second anniversary of the Closing, the Buyers shall not, and
shall cause the other Buyer Affiliates not to, take any action that would
cause any KA Party to terminate as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 708(b)(1)(A) of the Code.

 



 

 **10.6.** **_Tax Treatment of the Transactions_** **. **Unless otherwise
required by applicable Law:

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 10.6(b)_, the KAFA Acquisition is intended to be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) from the perspective of the
KA Owners as, in part, a contribution of KA Owners KAFA Interests to AH LP in
exchange for Ares Holdings Units in a non-recognition exchange governed by
Section 721 of the Code and, in part, a transfer of the KA Owners KAFA
Interests to AH LP for cash in a taxable exchange and (ii) from the
perspective of AH LP, as a contribution of the KAFA Interests to AH LP in
exchange for Ares Holdings Units in a non-recognition exchange governed by
Section 721 of the Code and an acquisition of the KAFA Interests for cash.

 



 

(b) The Buyers and the KA Owners shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause (i) the Post-Closing KA Percentage of the lesser of (A)
Closing Base Cash Consideration and (B) the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (such lesser amount, the " **Debt-Financed Distribution** ") to be
treated as a "debt-financed transfer" from each of the Buyers to the KA Owners
within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(b), (ii) the Debt
Financing to be characterized as a nonrecourse liability within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-1(a)(2) and (iii) the proceeds of such
Debt-Financed Distribution to be traceable under Treasury Regulations Section
1.163-8T to the proceeds of the Debt Financing; in each case, _provided_ that,
at the Buyers request and subject to the Sellers Representatives consent
(not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Buyers and the
KA Owners shall, alternatively, enter into an amendment to this Agreement to
provide that a Buyer Affiliate shall assume indebtedness of the KA Owners in
lieu of payment of the Closing Base Cash Consideration (or a portion thereof),
which indebtedness may be repaid by a Buyer Affiliate with the proceeds of the
Debt Financing, in a manner intended to qualify as a "refinancing" with the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(c). Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, (i) the Debt Financing may be consummated prior to the
Closing and if the Closing is delayed beyond the date anticipated by the
parties, such failure to incur the Debt Financing within the time period
required under Treasury Regulations Section 1.707-5(b) will not be deemed to
be a failure by any party to use its "commercially reasonable efforts" for
purposes of _Section 10.6(b)(i)_ and (ii) the Buyers shall not be obligated
to take or refrain from taking any action under this _Section 10.6_ if such
action could adversely affect (x) the Buyers, any Buyer Affiliate or the
equityholders of Ares Management or (y) the certainty of consummating the Debt
Financing or the Transactions. The Debt Financing that is the basis for the
Debt-

 



      
 

 



 

Financed Distribution will not be refinanced and the terms of such Debt
Financing will not be amended, in each case, prior to May 7, 2021, unless (A)
such refinancing or amendment would not adversely affect the intended U.S.
federal income tax treatment of the Debt-Financed Distribution pursuant to
this _Section 10.6(b)_, as mutually agreed to by the Buyers and the Sellers
Representative in good faith, (B) the applicable Buyer Affiliate waives
restrictions on the sale or exchange of Ares Operating Group Units (together
with any prior waivers) to provide each applicable KA Owner sufficient
liquidity (determined after considering all Ares Equity Interests of such KA
Owner at such time not subject to any lock-up period) to pay the income taxes
on gains incurred by such KA Owner directly as a result of such refinancing or
amendment or (C) the Governing Body of Ares Management determines in good
faith that forgoing such refinancing or amendment would adversely affect the
Buyers, any Buyer Affiliate or the equityholders of Ares Management.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 10.6(b)_, the KACALP Acquisition is intended to be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) from the perspective of the
KA Owners as, in part, a contribution of the KA Owners KACALP Interests to AI
LP in exchange for Ares Investments Units in a non-recognition exchange
governed by Section 721 of the Code and, in part, a transfer of the KA Owners
KACALP Interests to AI LP to the extent of any cash received in a taxable
exchange, and (ii) from the perspective of AI LP, as a contribution of the
KACALP Interests to AI LP in exchange for Ares Investments Units in a non-
recognition exchange governed by Section 721 of the Code and an acquisition of
the KACALP Interests for cash to the extent of any cash paid.

 



 

(d) Subject to _Section 10.6(b)_, the acquisition by AI LP of the Additional
EPE Interests is intended to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(i) from the perspective of the transferors of such Additional EPE Interests
as, in part, a contribution of such transferors Additional EPE Interests to
AI LP in exchange for Ares Investments Units in a non-recognition exchange
governed by Section 721 of the Code and, in part, a transfer of such
transferors Additional EPE Interests to AI LP to the extent of any cash
received in a taxable exchange, and (ii) from the perspective of AI LP, as a
contribution of the Additional EPE Interests to AI LP in exchange for Ares
Investments Units in a non-recognition exchange governed by Section 721 of the
Code and an acquisition of the Additional EPE Interests for cash to the extent
of any cash paid.

 



 

(e) The Buyers, on the one hand, and the applicable KA Owners, on the other
hand, shall report the transactions described in _Sections 2.12_ and _2.13_
consistent with their intended U.S. federal income tax treatment as mutually
agreed to by the parties in good faith; _provided_ that if the parties fail to
agree to such tax treatment by the 60th day prior to the due date for the
filing of any applicable Tax Return for such transactions, such disagreement
shall be submitted to the Accountant and resolved in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Section _10.7(b)_.

 



 

(f) The applicable Buyers, the Sellers Representative and the KA Owners shall
file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with this _Section 10.6_ and
otherwise act in a manner consistent with the intended tax treatment described
in this _Section 10.6_, including that the acquisition of the KAFA Interests
by AH LP and the acquisition of the KACALP Interests

 



      
 

 



 

and the Additional EPE Interests by AI LP shall be treated as separate
transactions for U.S. federal, and all applicable state, income tax purposes.

 



 

 **10.7.** **_Allocation of Total Consideration_**.

 



 

(a) At the request of the applicable Buyer, the Sellers Representative shall
cause KAFA, KACALP and each issuing entity (" **EPE Entity** ") of the
Additional EPE Interests that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes to make and include an election under Section 754 of the
Code on the Tax Return (both federal and any applicable state Tax Return) of
each of KAFA, KACALP and the EPE Entities (collectively, the " **Acquired
Entities** ") for the taxable period that includes the Closing Date. For
purposes of allocating the gross consideration pursuant to Sections 1060, 743,
751 and 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder among the
portion of the assets of the Acquired Entities that are deemed to be acquired
by the Buyers (and for all other Tax purposes), the respective gross fair
market values of the assets of the Acquired Entities will be determined in
accordance with principles set forth on _Annex H_. The parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the gross
consideration prior to the Closing Date, including the portion of the gross
consideration to be allocated to KA Associates, Inc. Within 45 days after the
date hereof, the Buyers shall prepare and provide to the Sellers
Representative proposed allocations of the final consideration, as determined
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, among the portion of the assets of the
Acquired Entities that are deemed to be acquired by the Buyers that is
consistent with the preceding sentence (the " **Allocation Statements** ").
The Sellers Representative may deliver a written notice to the Buyers of any
disagreement with the Buyers proposed Allocation Statements within 20 days of
receipt of the same (a " **Disagreement Notice** "). If the Sellers
Representative does not deliver a Disagreement Notice within such 20 day
period, such proposed Allocation Statements will represent the parties
agreement as to the final allocations of the consideration among the portion
of the assets of the Acquired Entities that are deemed to be acquired by the
Buyers. If the Sellers Representative delivers a Disagreement Notice within
such 20 day period, the Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate
in good faith to resolve any such disagreement.

 



 

(b) If the Buyers and the Sellers Representative fail to agree on the
proposed allocations within 20 days after delivery of the Disagreement Notice,
the Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall each deliver to the other and
to the Accountant a notice setting forth in reasonable detail their proposed
allocations. The Buyers and the Sellers Representative shall promptly
cooperate with the Accountant. The Accountant shall be instructed to determine
the final allocations of the consideration among the portion of the assets of
the Acquired Entities that are deemed to be acquired by the Buyers and provide
a written report setting forth such allocations (the " **Final Allocation
Schedule** ") no later than 20 days following the date of the Accountants
retention with respect to the Allocation Statements. The costs and expenses of
the Accountant with respect to the Allocation Statements shall be allocated
between the Buyers, on the one hand, and the Sellers Representative, on the
other hand, based upon the percentage that the portion of the aggregate amount
of the items or amounts unsuccessfully disputed by each party bears to the
total amount of such disputed items, as reasonably determined by the
Accountant. The Final Allocation Schedule, and the Accountants allocation of
its costs and expenses between the parties, shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon all of the parties hereto and shall become the final Allocation
Statements.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The Allocation Statements will be adjusted as appropriate, consistent with
this _Section 10.7_, to reflect any additional payments and adjustments to
the Total Consideration (including any payments under _Section 9.3(f)_ that
are treated as adjustments to the Total Consideration). The Buyers, the
Sellers Representative and the KA Owners shall file all Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with this _Section 10.7_ and the final Allocation
Statements, unless otherwise required by applicable Law or pursuant to a final
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The Buyers
and the Sellers Representative shall (i) promptly inform one another in
writing of, and provide information reasonably requested by the other party in
connection with, any challenge by any Tax authority to any allocation of the
consideration or other determination made pursuant to this _Section 10.7_ and
(ii) consult with and keep one another informed with respect to the status of,
and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, any such
challenge.

 



 

 **10.8.** **_Change Requests_** **.**

 



 

(a) The KA Parties shall (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or
cause to be obtained, all Consents that may be or become necessary to approve
the Change Requests and (ii) not take any action that will have the effect of
materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any such Consents.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of the KA Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any inquiries by any applicable
Governmental Entity regarding the Change Requests. The KA Parties shall (i)
notify the Buyers in advance of all meetings and material discussions with any
applicable Governmental Entity so as to allow the Buyers and their
Representatives to participate in such communications, (ii) submit to the
Buyers drafts of any memoranda, forms or written materials to be filed by any
of them, or on their behalf, with any applicable Governmental Entity in
connection with the Change Requests and (iii) consult and cooperate with the
Buyers, and consider and reflect in good faith the views and comments of the
Buyers, in connection therewith.

 



 

 **10.9.** **_Voluntary Disclosure_** **. **Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyers may, based on a good
faith determination that such action is appropriate to reduce potential Tax
liabilities of the KA Entities, initiate requests for voluntary disclosure
relief with one or more state or local Governmental Entities relating to sales
and use (and any similar) or state and local income Taxes for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period in circumstances in which the Buyers determine that a KA Entity
should collect and remit such Taxes with respect to jurisdictions in which the
KA Entities have not historically, prior to the Closing Date, collected and
remitted such Taxes; _provided_ that no such action shall be permitted without
the Sellers Representatives prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Any Liability of a KA Entity
for Taxes arising as a result of actions taken by or at the direction of the
Buyers pursuant to this _Section 10.9_ shall be deemed a Liability for Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period and subject to indemnification under _Section
10.4(a)(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI**

 



 

 **SELLERS  REPRESENTATIVE**

 



 

 **11.1.** **_Authorization of the Sellers  Representative_** **.** The
Sellers Representative shall act on behalf of the KA Owners, and accepts the
appointment by each such KA Owner to act on its behalf, as provided herein. In
connection with such appointment, the Sellers Representative shall be
authorized and empowered to act, on behalf of each of the KA Owners after the
date hereof in connection with the activities to be performed on behalf of the
KA Owners under this Agreement, for the purposes and with the powers and
authority hereinafter set forth in this _ARTICLE XI_, which shall include,
the power and authority on behalf of the KA Owners:

 



 

(a) to give and receive notices and communications hereunder, including any

activities described in this _Section 11.1_ and the Transactions and all
other agreements, documents or instruments referred to herein or executed in
connection herewith.

 



 

 **11.2.** **_Buyers Entitled to Rely_** **. **The Buyers and their respective
Affiliates may (a) rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on (i) any document executed or purported to be executed by the
Sellers Representative on behalf of any KA Owner and (ii) the full power and
authority of the Sellers Representative to act hereunder on behalf of the KA

KA Owners with respect to all matters pursuant to the authority granted in
this Agreement. The Buyers shall not be liable to any KA Owner for any action
the Buyers take or omit to take in reliance upon such document, power or
authority. The KA Owners acknowledge that the type or amount of the
consideration to be received by the KA Owners may be reallocated or otherwise
changed by the Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement and that the

attorney granted by each KA Owner (a) shall be deemed coupled with an interest
and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and survive the death,
incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any KA Owner and (b) shall survive
the consummation of the Transactions. Any action taken by the Sellers
Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this Agreement shall be
effective and absolutely binding on each KA Owner notwithstanding any contrary
action of or direction from such KA Owner. Without limiting the foregoing, any
decision or action by the Sellers Representative hereunder, including any
agreement between the Sellers Representative and the Buyers relating to the
defense, payment or settlement of any claims for indemnification hereunder,
shall constitute a decision or action of all KA Owners and shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon each such KA Owner. No KA Owner shall have the
right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
provisions of this _ARTICLE XI_, including the power of attorney granted
hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an
interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more KA Owners,
or by operation of Law. The provisions of this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be binding
upon the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of each KA
Owner.

 



 

 **11.4.** **_Replacement of the Sellers  Representative_** **.** Subject to
the appointment and acceptance of a successor Sellers Representative, as
provided below, (a) the Sellers Representative may be removed or replaced by
the KA Owners at any time upon the vote of the KA Owners whose Pro Rata
Percentages in the aggregate exceed 50% (a " **Majority Vote** ") and (b) the
Sellers Representative may resign at any time upon 30 days prior written
notice to the KA Owners. Upon any such removal or resignation or upon the
death or disability of the Sellers Representative, the KA Owners shall
promptly appoint a successor Sellers Representative by a

 



      
 

 



 

Majority Vote. If no successor Sellers Representative shall have been
appointed by the KA Owners and accepted within 20 days after the delivery of a
Sellers Representative notice of resignation, then the departing Sellers
Representative may, on behalf of the KA Owners, appoint a successor Sellers
Representative. Notice of the appointment shall be sent to the Buyers, and
such appointment shall be effective upon the later of the date indicated in
such notice or the date such notice is received by the Buyers. Until such
notice is received, the Buyers shall be entitled to rely on the decisions and
actions of the prior Sellers Representative as described herein. Upon the
effectiveness of any appointment as a successor Sellers Representative
hereunder, such successor Sellers Representative shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of, and
subject to all limitations on, and obligations of, the departing Sellers
Representative, and the departing Sellers Representative shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. Any successor shall become the
Sellers Representative for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **11.5.** **_Sellers  Representative Performance_** **. **Each KA Owner
shall (i) pay or reimburse the Sellers Representative for its costs and
expenses hereunder (including indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section
11.6_), in accordance with its Pro Rata Percentage and (ii) cause the Sellers
Representative (and any permitted assignees thereof) to perform all of the
Sellers Representatives obligations after the Closing pursuant to any
Transaction Document, including pursuant to _Sections 2.6(b)_, _ARTICLE X_,
and _Sections 12.9_ and _12.13_ of this Agreement, in each case, subject to
the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the Transaction Documents.

 



 

 **11.6.** **_Indemnification of Sellers  Representative_**. The Sellers
Representative shall not be liable to the KA Owners for actions taken pursuant
to the Transaction Documents, except to the extent such actions shall have
constituted gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud. Each KA Owner shall
indemnify severally and not jointly in accordance with its Pro Rata
Percentage, and defend and hold harmless the Sellers Representative from and
against any and all Losses arising out of and in connection with its
activities as Sellers Representative under the Transaction Documents or
otherwise, in each case as such Loss is suffered or incurred other than to the
extent such Loss is attributable the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of the Sellers Representative. In no event will the Sellers
Representative be required hereunder to advance its own funds on behalf of the
KA Owners or otherwise.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII**

 



 

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

 **12.1.** **_Survival_** **.** The representations and warranties of the KA
Owners and the KA Parties made in _ARTICLE III_ and _ARTICLE IV_ shall
survive the Closing until 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on the date that is 18 months
following the Closing Date (the " **General Survival Date** "); _provided_
that the Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing until the 60th
day immediately following the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation (including all applicable extensions thereof) with respect thereto.
The representations and warranties of the Buyers made in _ARTICLE V_ shall
expire and be of no further force and effect as of the Closing; _provided_
that (i) the Fundamental Representations of the Buyers shall survive the
Closing until the 60th day immediately following the expiration of all
applicable statutes of limitation

 



      
 

 



 

(including all applicable extensions thereof) with respect thereto and (ii)
the Ares Public Disclosure Representations shall survive the Closing until the
General Survival Date. The Pre-Closing Covenants shall survive the Closing
until the General Survival Date and the Post-Closing Covenants shall survive
the Closing in accordance with their terms until the 60th day immediately
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitation (including
all applicable extensions thereof). Except as otherwise set forth herein, the
applicable survival period described in this _Section 12.1_ supersedes any
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
12.1_ to the contrary, any representation, warranty, or covenant that would
otherwise terminate in accordance with this _Section 12.1_ will continue to
survive if an Indemnity Notice shall have been timely given under _ARTICLE
IX_ on or prior to such termination date, until the related claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in
_ARTICLE IX_ or _Section 10.4_.

 



 

 **12.2.** **_Press Releases and Public Announcement_** **.** The KA Owners,
KA Parties and the Buyers shall not, and each such party shall cause its
Affiliates and its and its Affiliates respective Representatives to not, (a)
issue any press release, (b) make any public announcement, or (c) respond to
any requests for information or inquiries from any Person (including any
reporter), in each case, relating to the Transaction Documents or the
Transactions (except (i) as provided herein with respect to communications
with Governmental Entities or (ii) previously mutually agreed upon
communications to Clients, KA Fund Investors, Ares Clients or Ares Fund
Investors, without the prior review and written approval of the Sellers
Representative, in the case of the Buyers, and the Buyers, in the case of the
KA Owners or the KA Parties (in each case, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)); _provided_ that if such release or announcement is
required by Law or by any national securities exchange and such party is
unable after good faith efforts to obtain timely the approval of the other
party (to the extent obtaining such approval is permitted by applicable Law
and reasonably practicable), then such party may make or issue the legally
required release or announcement and promptly furnish the other party with a
copy thereof. The KA Owners and KA Parties, on the one hand, and the Buyers,
on the other hand, shall immediately (and in any event within one Business
Day) give the other notice of any requests for information or inquiries from
any representative of a newspaper, magazine, radio, television, internet
publication or other media outlet, in each case, relating to the Transactions.

 



 

 **12.3.** **_No Third-Party Beneficiaries_** **.** The terms and provisions
of this Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and it is not the
intention of the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights, and this
Agreement does not confer any such rights, upon any other Person (including
any KA Owner that is not a party hereto), except for any Person entitled to
indemnity under _ARTICLE IX_.

 



 

 **12.4.** **_Entire Agreement_** **.** This Agreement (including the Annexes,
Exhibits, Schedules, the KA Disclosure Schedule and the Ares Disclosure
Schedule hereto and all documents and certificates delivered by the Buyers,
the KA Parties and the KA Owners pursuant hereto), together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire understanding between the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
prior understandings, agreements (including any term sheets) or
representations by or between the parties hereto, written or oral, with
respect to such subject matter.

 



       
 

 



 

 **12.5.** **_Succession and Assignment_** **.** Subject to the next sentence,
this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by
the parties named herein and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. No party hereto may assign either this Agreement or any of its or
their respective rights, interests or obligations hereunder without the prior
written approval of (a) the Sellers Representative, in the case of assignment
by the Buyers, or (b) the Buyers, in the case of assignment by a KA Owner or a
KA Party, and any attempt to do so will be null and void _ab initio_ ;
_provided_ that (i) any of the Buyers may assign, in its sole discretion, any
or all of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder to any other Buyer
Affiliate without obtaining the consent of the Sellers Representative and
(ii) no such assignment shall relieve such Buyer of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **12.6.** **_Drafting_** **.** The parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or
question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed
as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof
shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.7.** **_Notices_** **.** All notices, requests and other communications
hereunder must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given only

_Section 12.7_). Any party hereto may change the address to which notices,
requests and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the
other party hereto notice in the manner set forth herein.

 



 

 **12.8.** **_Governing Law_** **.** This Agreement, the legal relations
between the parties and the adjudication and enforcement thereof shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to any choice of Law or conflict of Law provision
or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York.

 



 

 **12.9.** **_Arbitration_**.

 



 

(a) Except as provided in Section 12.15, and except for requests for orders in
aid of arbitration or enforcement of the award of an arbitrator or as set
forth in _Section 2.6_, all disputes arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
validity thereof or the legal relations between the parties, including
disputes about arbitrability or the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal,
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be determined by final, binding
and confidential arbitration in

 



      
 

 



 

New York, New York, conducted by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services/Endispute, Inc. (" **JAMS** "), or its successor, before a panel of
arbitrators comprised of one arbitrator selected by the Sellers
Representative, one arbitrator selected by the Buyers and one arbitrator (who
shall chair the tribunal) jointly selected by the other two arbitrators.
Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. §§116, and JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures then
in effect. The arbitral tribunal will have the same, but no greater, remedial
authority than would a court of law and shall issue a written decision
including the arbitral tribunals essential findings and conclusions and a
statement of the award. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitral
tribunal may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. Except in
accordance with any express exception contained in this Agreement, each party
hereby irrevocably waives and foregoes any right to recover remote,
speculative or punitive damages with respect to any dispute as set forth in
_Section 9.3(e)_, and the parties hereby agree that the arbitral tribunal is
not empowered to award damages except in accordance with the express
limitations contained in this Agreement (including _Section 9.3(e)_). The
award of such arbitral tribunal shall be a reasoned award.

 



 

(b) The prevailing party in any such arbitration proceeding, as determined by
the arbitral tribunal, or in any proceeding to enforce the arbitration award,
will be entitled, to the extent permitted by Law, to reimbursement from the
other party for all of the prevailing partys costs (including but not limited
to the arbitral tribunals fees), expenses and attorneys fees. If no party
entirely prevails in such arbitration or proceeding, the arbitral tribunal or
court shall apportion an award of such fees based on the relative success of
each party. In the event of a conflict between this provision and any
provision in the applicable rules of JAMS, the provisions of this Agreement
will prevail.

 



 

(c) The arbitral award shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
and judgment upon any award may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction over any of the parties or any of their assets. All notices
relating to any arbitration hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
effective if given in accordance with the provisions of _Section 12.7_.

 



 

(d) By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any
court, as provided for in _Section 12.10_, of its jurisdiction to issue a
pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment, or other order in aid of
arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any award and judgment thereon.
Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under the
jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to
grant provisional remedies or modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary
relief issued by a court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to
respect the arbitral tribunals orders to that effect.

 



 

 **12.10.** **_Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial_** **.**
Subject to the arbitration requirements of _Section 12.9_ and except as set
forth in _Section 2.6_, all actions permitted under this Agreement (including
any action to compel arbitration in aid of arbitration or for provisional
relief in aid of arbitration) shall be brought exclusively in any state or
federal court located within the County of Los Angeles in the State of
California. Each of the parties hereto consents and agrees to the jurisdiction
of the aforesaid courts for such purpose, and waives any objection as to the
venue of such courts for purposes of such action or any claim of inconvenient
forum. Each of the parties hereto further consents and agrees that any action
to enforce a final arbitral award or judgment thereon may be brought in any
court of competent

 



      
 

 



 

jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto further irrevocably consents to the
service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action
or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid, to such party at the address specified in this
Agreement, such service to become effective 15 days after such mailing.
Nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit the ability of any party
hereto to serve any such legal process, summons, notices and documents in any
other manner permitted by applicable Law. **Each of the parties hereto
irrevocably and unconditionally waives all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding permitted hereunder.**

 



 

 **12.11.** **_Amendments and Waivers_** **.** No amendment of any provision
of this Agreement shall be valid unless such amendment is in writing and
signed by the Buyers and the Sellers Representative. No waiver by any party
hereto of any default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any prior
or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant
hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or
subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall be valid unless such waiver is in
writing and signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be
enforced (it being understood that a waiver signed by the Sellers
Representative is valid against all the KA Owners and, prior to the Closing,
KAFA and KACALP).

 



 

 **12.12.** **_Severability_** **.** If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law,
and if the rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will
not be materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be
fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of
this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and will not be affected
by such provision or its severance herefrom and (d) in lieu of such provision,
the parties will negotiate in good faith to add as a part of this Agreement a
legal, valid and enforceable provision as similar in terms to such provision
as may be possible.

 



 

 **12.13.** **_Expenses_** **.** Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, each of the parties hereto will bear its own costs and expenses
(including legal fees and expenses) incurred in connection with the
Transaction Documents and the Transactions; _provided_ that (a) the KA Parties
will bear the costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) incurred
by the KA Entities up to the Closing Date in connection with the Transaction
Documents and the Transactions, (b) if the Transactions are consummated, the
Buyers shall bear 100% of the Proxy Solicitation and Appraisal Fees and (c) if
this Agreement is terminated, the Buyers, on the one hand, and the KA
Entities, on the other hand, shall each bear 50% of the Proxy Solicitation and
Appraisal Fees.

 



 

 **12.14.** **_Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules_** **. **The Annexes, Exhibits
and Schedules (including the KA Disclosure Schedule and the Ares Disclosure
Schedule) identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference
and made a part hereof. The disclosure of any item in any section or
subsection of the KA Disclosure Schedule or the Ares Disclosure Schedule will
only be deemed disclosure with respect to another section or subsection of the
KA Disclosure Schedule or the Ares Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, if it
is reasonably apparent from reading such item that it applies to such other
section or subsection of the KA Disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

Schedule or the Ares Disclosure Schedule. If there is any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the KA
Disclosure Schedule or the Ares Disclosure Schedule, the statements in the
body of this Agreement will control. Certain information set forth in the KA
Disclosure Schedule and the Ares Disclosure Schedule is included solely for
informational purposes, is not an admission of Liability with respect to the
matters covered by the information or an admission that such matters actually
constitute noncompliance with, or a violation of any Law, Order, Permit or
Contract or other topic to which such disclosure is applicable, and may not be
required to be disclosed pursuant to this Agreement. All references in the KA
Disclosure Schedule and the Ares Disclosure Schedule to the enforceability of
agreements with third parties, the existence or non-existence of third-party
rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third parties, or similar
matters or statements, are intended only to allocate rights and risks among
the parties to this Agreement and are not intended to be admissions against
interests, give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible
against any party by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement, or give
rise to any claim or benefit to any Person who is not a party to this
Agreement.

 



 

 **12.15.** **_Specific Performance_** **.** Each party to this Agreement
agrees that, in view of the uniqueness of the Transactions, any failure to
perform or breach of its obligations under this Agreement will result in
irreparable damage to the other party, that the remedies available to such
other party at Law alone will be an inadequate remedy for such failure or
breach, and that such other party may seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. Accordingly, each of
the parties agrees that the other party will be entitled to seek an order (or
orders) or injunction (or injunctions) to prevent or cure breaches or
violations of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement without the requirement of posting any
bond or other type of security. Each party further agrees that, if the other
party seeks to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
in respect of such breach or violation, it will not assert as a defense that a
remedy at Law would be adequate. The parties further agree that (a) by seeking
any remedy provided for in this _Section 12.15_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to such party under this Agreement, and (b) nothing contained in this _Section
12.15_ shall require any party to seek (or limit any partys right to seek)
specific performance under this Agreement before exercising any other right
under this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.16.** **_Privilege_** **.** All Privileged Communications made before
the consummation of the Closing shall continue after the Closing to be
privileged communications with such counsel (including Paul Hastings LLP) that
is controlled by the Sellers Representative. Neither Buyers nor any Buyer
Affiliate nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through Buyers or
any Buyer Affiliate shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the
grounds that the privilege attaching to such communications belongs to Buyers,
the KA Parties or the Subsidiaries; _provided_ that none of the Buyer
Affiliates is waiving or abandoning, nor may any KA Owner or the Sellers
Representative waive or abandon, such attorney-client privilege to the extent
it relates to any investigation or communication involving the KA Parties or
any of their Subsidiaries or any Third-Party Claim, without Buyers prior
written consent.

 



      
 

 



 

 **12.17.** **_Headings_** **.** The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.18.** **_Counterparts_** **.** This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

 



 

 **[** Signature Page Follows **]**

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement as of
the date first written above.
