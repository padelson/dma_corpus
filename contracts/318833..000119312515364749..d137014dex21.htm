8 ARTICLE 2

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 2.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "),
whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_
"). As a result of the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 2.02 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place in New York City
at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New
York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time on the second Business
Day following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_ (except for any conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions or waiver by the Party entitled to waive such
conditions), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 2.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and acknowledged in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 2.04 _Effects of the Merger_. (a) At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 259
of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the property,
rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL.

 

Section 2.05 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger
Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of any holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

 



9 (b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
_Section 2.05(a)_) shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right to
receive 0.215 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Parent Stock (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), less any withholding in accordance with _Section
2.08(i)_.

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.05_ shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or (ii) shares of Company Stock held in
book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Stock.

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.06 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a)
the Effective Time or (b) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Article 10_ , the outstanding shares of Company Stock or Parent Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with
a record date within said period, then the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Company Stock (including
Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Stock) the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this
_Section 2.06_ shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that
is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this
Agreement.

 

Section 2.07 _No Fractional Shares_.

 

(a) No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued in connection with
the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent
Stock shall be delivered upon the conversion of Company Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.05_ and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent
Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who otherwise would
be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Stock (after
aggregating all shares of Company Stock represented by Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares held by such holder) will be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to an amount representing such holders proportionate interest
in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of all such
holders of the shares of Parent Stock that would otherwise be issued to such
holders pursuant to _Section 2.07(b)_.

 



10 (b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of whole shares of Parent
Stock issued and delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
2.08(a)_ representing the Merger Consideration over (ii) the aggregate number
of whole shares of Parent Stock to be distributed to former holders of
Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.08 (such excess, the " _Parent Excess
Shares_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall, on behalf
of former holders of Company Stock, sell the Parent Excess Shares at the
then-prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sale of the Parent Excess Shares by
the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member
firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. The Exchange Agent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
complete the sale of the Parent Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as is practicable, consistent with obtaining the best execution
of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Until the net
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company Stock, the
Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for holders of Company Stock
(the " _Parent Shares Trust_ "). The amount of all commissions, transfer taxes
and other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of
Parent Excess Shares shall be paid by the Company. The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Parent Shares Trust to which each former holder
of Company Stock is entitled, if any, by multiplying that amount of the
aggregate net proceeds composing the Parent Shares Trust by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which
such former holder of Company Stock is entitled (after taking into account all
shares of Parent Stock held as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by
such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all former holders of Company Stock are
entitled (such product being the " _Fractional Share Cash Amount_ ").

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing Company Stock with respect to any fractional share interest, the
Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares.

 

Section 2.08 _Payment of Merger Consideration_. (a) Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange agreement with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), and shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company evidence of Parent Stock in book-entry form (and/or certificates
representing such Parent Stock, at Parents election) representing the
aggregate amount of shares of Parent Stock sufficient to deliver the Merger
Consideration (such shares, together with any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ "). The
Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be issued pursuant to
_Section 2.05_ out of the Merger Fund. Except as provided in _Section
2.08(h)_, the Merger Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b)  _Payment Procedures_.

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the second

 



11  Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of record of a
Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.05_, (A) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form and have such other provisions
as Parent may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to
which such Certificates become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.08(d)_
(the " _Exchanged Amounts_ "). Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver in exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, the aggregate
Exchanged Amounts in respect thereof, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Exchanged Amounts that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this _Article 2_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company Stock were converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.05_ shall
automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver, the Exchanged Amounts as promptly
as practicable after the Effective Time. No interest shall be paid or accrue
on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

(c) The Exchanged Amounts paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article
2_ upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in the case of the
Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Stock. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article
2_.

 

(d) No dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered share of Company Stock until such holder shall surrender
such share in accordance with this _Section 2.08_. After the surrender in
accordance with this _Section 2.08_ of a share of Company Stock to
be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.05_,

 



12  the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Merger
Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.07_) any such dividends or other distributions,
without interest thereon, which had become payable with respect to the Parent
Stock issuable in respect of such share of Company Stock.

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for
the Exchanged Amounts.

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any amount
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former
holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate.

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Merger Fund as
directed by Parent;  _provided_ , that no such investment income or gain or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any
interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the
sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and
no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit
of holders of Company Stock; _provided_ , that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Company Stock pursuant to this _Article 2_. If for any reason (including
losses) the cash in the Merger Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy
all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Merger Fund in an
amount equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy
such cash payment obligations.

(i) Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment otherwise payable
hereunder such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the person in respect of which such deduction or withholding
was made.

 



13 Section 2.09 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

 

Section 2.10 _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares; Company RSUs;
Company PSUs_. (a) _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each
compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Stock (a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, shall, automatically and without any required action on the part
of the holder thereof, (i) if such Company Stock Option is a Specified Award,
become vested and exercisable in full and (ii) be converted into an option (an
" _Adjusted Stock Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions
(except that the additional vesting and exercise provisions set forth on
_Section 2.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall apply to such Adjusted
Stock Option) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Stock (rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product of (i) the
Exchange Ratio _multiplied by_ (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (with such number determined by deeming any applicable performance
conditions to be satisfied in full), at an exercise price per share of
Parent Stock equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of Company Stock subject
to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (B)
the Exchange Ratio.

(b) _Company Restricted Shares_. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or other lapse restrictions granted
pursuant to a compensatory award (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ") that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and
become free of restrictions, and any repurchase rights shall lapse, and the
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration (subject
to _Section 2.07_ and _Section 2.08(d)_) with respect to each such Company
Restricted Share, less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld as
provided in _Section 2.08(i)_.

 



14 (c) _Company RSUs and Company PSUs_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU and each Company PSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not a
Specified Award shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award (an "
_Adjusted RSU_ ") with the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the
corresponding Company RSU or Company PSU, as applicable, immediately prior to
the Effective Time (except that (i) no performance-based vesting condition
shall apply to such Adjusted RSU and (ii) the additional vesting provisions
set forth on _Section 2.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall apply to
such Adjusted RSU) and relating to the number of shares of Parent Stock,
rounded to the nearest whole number of shares, determined by multiplying the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Company RSU or Company
PSU, as applicable, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (with such
number of shares determined, for purposes of each Company PSU, by deeming the
applicable performance-based vesting condition to be achieved at the maximum
level) by the Exchange Ratio.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Company RSU and each Company PSU that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is a Specified
Award shall vest in full (and in the case of a Company PSU, the applicable
performance-based vesting condition shall be deemed to be achieved at the
maximum level), and the holder of each such Company RSU and Company PSU shall
be entitled to receive the number of shares of Parent Stock (rounded to the
nearest whole number of shares) equal to the product of (i) the Exchange
Ratio, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
such Company RSU or Company PSU as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(with such number of shares determined, for purposes of each Company PSU, by
deeming the applicable performance-based vesting condition to be achieved at
the maximum level), less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld as
provided in Section 2.08(i).

(d) _Company Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or its
Compensation Committee shall adopt resolutions approving the treatment of the
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs and Company
PSUs (collectively, the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.10_.

(e) Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act on an appropriate form,
or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously filed
under the Securities Act, with respect to the shares of Parent Stock subject
to the Adjusted Options and the Adjusted RSUs.

ARTICLE 3

 

 _THE SURVIVING CORPORATION_

 

Section 3.01 _Surviving Corporation Matters_. (a) At the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time, but as amended as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
further amended in accordance with applicable Law.

 



15 (b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended so as to read in their entirety as the by-laws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except the references to
Merger Subs name shall be replaced by references to the Surviving Corporation
until further amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and
applicable Law.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, until their successors have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal: (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and
(ii) the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation. To the extent requested by
Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the applicable directors of each Subsidiary of the Company
(or those Subsidiaries of the Company identified by Parent) to tender their
resignations as directors of the applicable Subsidiary of the Company,
effective as of the Effective Time, to deliver to Parent written evidence of
such resignations (to be effective as of the Effective Time) prior to the
Effective Time. In connection with the foregoing, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent, including by providing to Parent information and
access pursuant to and subject to _Section 8.07_ reasonably requested by
Parent. Parent agrees that as a condition to any resignation contemplated by
this _Section 3.01(c)_ requested by Parent, Parent will acknowledge in
writing that such resignation is without prejudice to the applicable
individuals rights under any applicable Company Plan.

ARTICLE 4

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents filed or furnished since
January 1, 2014 (excluding any disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC
Document in any risk factor section, any disclosure in any section relating to
forward-looking statements or any other statements that are non-specific,
predictive or primarily cautionary in nature other than historical
facts included therein), where the relevance of the information as an
exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is
reasonably apparent, or (b) as set forth in the applicable part or subpart of

generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

31 (l) Apart from the UK DB Pension Scheme, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any associated or connected person has any liability or
contingent obligation to make payment to and has no other obligation or
contingent obligation to any occupational pension scheme to which Sections 38

disclosed financial position of Furmanite International Limited) which are

each case in relation to the UK DB Pension Scheme.

ARTICLE 5

 

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the Parent SEC Documents filed or furnished by
Parent with the SEC since June 1, 2014 (excluding any disclosures set forth
in any such Parent SEC Document in any risk factor section, any disclosure in
any section relating to forward-looking statements or any other statements
that are non-specific, predictive or primarily cautionary in nature
other than historical facts included therein), where the relevance of the
information as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular
representation is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or (b)
as set forth in the applicable part or subpart of the disclosure letter
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub to the Company in connection with, and upon
the

 



38  execution of, this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") or any
other part or subpart of the Parent Disclosure Letter(each section of which
qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant
specified therein and such other representations, warranties or covenants
where its relevance as an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) such
other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably apparent), Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 5.01 _Corporate Existence and Power_. Parent is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Each
of Parent and Merger Sub has all corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where
such qualification is necessary, except where any failure to have such power
or authority or to be so qualified would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

to the Company true and complete copies of the organizational documents of
Parent and Merger Sub as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.02 _Corporate Authorization_. (a) The execution, delivery and

authority of Parent and Merger Sub and, except for the approval of Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and except for the need to obtain
the Parent Stockholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub. The affirmative vote of
a majority of votes cast by the holders of Parent Stock present in person or
represented by proxy at a meeting of Parent stockholders held for the purpose
of obtaining the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance by such affirmative
vote (such meeting, the " _Parent Stockholder Meeting_ "), and such approval,
the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of any
of Parents capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger. This Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
the Company, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of
whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at Law).

 

(b) At meetings duly called and held, as of the date of this Agreement, (i)
the Parent Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub each unanimously
(A) determined that the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, are advisable and fair to, and in the best
interests of, their respective companies and stockholders and (B) approved
this Agreement and the Merger, and (ii) the Parent Board unanimously resolved
to recommend the approval of the Parent Stock Issuance by Parents
stockholders (the recommendation set forth in this clause (ii), the " _Parent
Board Recommendation_ ").

Section 5.03 _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery
and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of

 



39  the Merger require no action by, approval or authorization of or filing

expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.

Section 5.04  _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Merger do not and will not, assuming the authorizations,
consents and approvals s referred to in _Section 5.03_ are obtained, (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the organizational documents of Parent and Merger Sub, (ii)
contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any Law or
Order, (iii) require any consent or other action by any Person under,
constitute a default or a violation, or an event that, with or without notice
or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or a violation, under or
of, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
right or obligation under, any provision of any Contract binding upon Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit,
certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting, or relating
in any way to, the assets or business of Parent and its Subsidiaries or (iv)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien, other than any Permitted
Lien, on any asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

incorporated or otherwise duly organized, validly existing and (where
applicable or recognized) in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization, except, in the case of any such Subsidiary,
where the failure to be so incorporated, organized, existing or in good

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of Parent has
all corporate, limited liability company or comparable powers and all
Governmental Authorizations required to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those powers or Governmental Authorizations the absence
of which has not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have,

prospectuses, registration statements and other documents required to be filed
or furnished, as the case may be, by Parent since May 31, 2013 (collectively,
together with any exhibits and schedules thereto and other information
incorporated therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of its filing date
(or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment
or supplement filed prior to the date of this Agreement), each Parent SEC
Document complied, and each Parent SEC Document filed or furnished subsequent

applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be. As of its filing date (or, if amended

filed prior to the date of this Agreement), each Parent SEC Document filed or
furnished pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading in any material
respect. Each Parent SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended
or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of
the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, and as of
the date of such supplement, did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in any
material respect.

(b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information (both
financial and non-financial) relating to Parent, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to Parents principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer by others within those entities,
particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports required under
the Exchange Act are being prepared. For purposes of this Agreement,
"principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the
meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



42 (c) Parent and its Subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of
internal controls. Such internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Parents financial reporting
and the preparation of Parent financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation of internal controls prior to the date of this Agreement, to
Parents auditors and audit committee (i) any significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in internal controls. Parent has disclosed to the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement a summary of any such disclosure made by management to
Parents auditors or audit committee since June 1, 2013 and prior to the date
of this Agreement.

of ongoing SEC review.

credit, arranged for the extension of credit, or renewed an extension of

Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(f) Each of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of
Parent (or each former principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of Parent, as applicable) have made all certifications required by
Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by the
SEC and the NYSE.

(g) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), in each case where the result, purpose
or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in
Parents financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents.

 

(h) Since the Parent Balance Sheet Date, there has been no transaction, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings,
nor is there any proposed transaction as of the date of this Agreement, or
series of similar transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries was or is to be a party, that would
be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated
under the Securities Act that has not been disclosed in Parents Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on August 7, 2015 or
other Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



43 Section 5.08 _Financial Statements_. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Parent
included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Documents (including
all related notes and schedules thereto) (a) fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim
financial statements), (b) comply in all material respects with the applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto, and (c) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of the unaudited interim statements, as may be permitted
under Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto).

 

Section 5.09 _Disclosure Documents_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement will, at
the time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities
Act, at the time the Joint Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or Parents stockholders, at the time of any amendment or
supplement thereto, or at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting or the
Parent Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading. The Registration Statement and the Joint
Proxy Statement (other than the portions of the Joint Proxy Statement
relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting) will comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5.09_, no
representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to information or
statements made or incorporated by reference that were not supplied by or on
behalf of Parent.

no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year,
which amount is set forth in _Section 7.04(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the " _Premium Cap_ "); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Premium Cap. At the Companys
option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail
policy" for a period beginning at the Effective Time and ending no later than
six (6) years after the Effective Time with coverage for the persons who are
covered by the Companys existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured
individuals as the Companys existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, in which event Parent
shall cease to have any obligations under the first sentence of this _Section
7.04(c)_; _provided_ that the aggregate premium for such policies shall not
exceed the Premium Cap. If the Company elects to purchase such a "tail
policy," the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and effect
and continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

 

(d) If either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties,
rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, succeed to or assume the applicable obligations of such Party set forth in
this  _Section 7.04_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured person hereunder (including the Company
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives and are
in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by Contract, at
Law or otherwise.

Section 7.05  _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Effective Time. 

 



54 Section 7.06 _Employee Matters_. (a) During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on the date that is six months following the
Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause to be provided, to each Continuing Employee, so long as such Continuing
Employee is employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries during the Continuation
Period, with, base salary or base wage rate, and target short-term incentive
opportunities (excluding equity-based incentive opportunities) that are no
less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary or base wage rate and
target short-term incentive opportunities (excluding equity-based incentive
opportunities) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date of
this Agreement.

 

(b) In addition, upon a termination of employment during the Continuation
Period, the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to receive severance
compensation and benefits under the applicable severance plan, policy or
program maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries on the same basis, and
pursuant to the same terms and conditions, as similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries. _Section 7.06(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure
Letter sets forth Parents severance plan maintained for individuals employed
by Parent and situated in the United States.

 

(c) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including, for the avoidance of doubt the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) to recognize, for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual, under all Company Plans and any
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") in
which the Continuing Employees become eligible to participate, each Continuing
Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary)
prior to the Effective Time to the same extent that such service is recognized
by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; _provided_
, that Parent shall not be required to provide credit for benefit accrual
purposes under any Parent Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan or
retiree medical plan. In addition with respect to each Parent Plan in which a
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate after the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) waive, or caused to be waived, all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Continuing
Employee under such Parent Plan and (ii) provide such Continuing Employee with
credit for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses already
incurred by the Continuing Employee under the corresponding Company Plan
during the year in which such Continuing Employee first becomes eligible to
participate in such Parent Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or
deductible requirements or out-of-pocket maximums under such Parent Plan.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Continuing Employees who are based outside of the United States, Parents
obligations under this _Section 7.06_ shall be in addition to and not in
contravention of any obligations under the Laws of the foreign countries and
political subdivisions thereof in which such Continuing Employees are based.

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.06_, expressed or implied, shall (i)
be treated as the establishment, amendment or modification of any Company
Plan or Parent Plan or

 



55  constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify, merge or terminate after
the Effective Time any Company Plan or Parent Plan, (ii) give any current or
former employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) or any other Person who is not a party to
this Agreement any third-party beneficiary or other rights or (iii) obligate
Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Company Plan
or Parent Plan or (B) retain the employment or services of any current or
former employee.

Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division

Agreement.

cooperate in determining the appropriate actions to be taken with respect to

8.03(b)_, approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or execute

agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to a
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) (each a " _Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (iii)
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) agree to do
any of the foregoing; _provided_ , that if, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, following the receipt of an unsolicited bona
fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of
this Agreement, the Company may, in response to such Company Acquisition
Proposal, and subject to compliance with  _Section 8.03(c)_, furnish
information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Person regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that (A) prior to furnishing, or causing to be furnished, any such nonpublic
information relating to the Company to such Person, the Company enters into an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) promptly following furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously so furnished to Parent or its Representatives).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company and its Representatives may in any event (i) seek to clarify and
understand the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by
any Person and (ii) inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge of the
Company, is considering making, a Company Acquisition Proposal of the
provisions of this _Section 8.03_.

 

(b) Except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.03(b)_, the Company Board
shall not effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change if: (I) (A) a written Company 

 



60  Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this Agreement
is made to the Company by a Third Party and such Company Acquisition Proposal
has not been withdrawn prior to the date of such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change and (B) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal; or (II) in all other cases not involving a Company
Acquisition Proposal, in response to a Company Intervening Event to the extent
that the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with the
Companys outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws;
_provided_ , that, in each case, prior to making any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change:

(i) the Company Board shall provide Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice shall
include, in the case of _Section 8.03(b)(I)_, the information with respect to
the Company Superior Proposal that is specified in  _Section 8.03(c)_ as
well as a copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal, or, in the case of
_Section 8.03(b)(II)_, the reasons underlying the Company Boards decision to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; and 

(ii) during the three (3) Business Days following such written notice, the
Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) regarding any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent; and at the end of such three
(3) Business Days, (a) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel (and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent), that the Company
Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Company Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Company Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notification from the Company and a new period under clause (i) of this
Section 8.03(b)) or (b) in all other cases not involving a Company Acquisition
Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel (and taking
into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent), that the failure to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company and Parent set forth in
_Section 8.03(a)_ and _Section 8.03(b)_, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) advise Parent orally and in writing of any
proposals or offers with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal that
are received by the Company (or any of its Representatives), indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making the proposal or offer and the material terms and conditions of any such
proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any written
proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material changes to the
status and material terms of any such proposals or offers (including any
material amendments thereto or any change to the scope or material terms or
conditions thereof, including copies of definitive agreements).

promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside counsel, that the failure to make
such disclosure would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that this _Section
8.03(d)_ shall not permit the Company Board to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise permitted by this
_Section 8.03_.

written Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Parent Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with Parents outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Superior Proposal in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this
Agreement, Parent may, in response to such Parent Acquisition Proposal, and
subject to compliance with _Section 8.04(c)_, furnish information with
respect to Parent to the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and
engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such Parent
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that (A) prior to furnishing,
or causing to be furnished, any such nonpublic information relating to Parent
to such Person, Parent enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
with the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal and (B) promptly
following furnishing any such nonpublic information to such Person, Parent
furnishes such nonpublic information to the Company (to the extent such
nonpublic information

 



63  has not been previously so furnished to the Company or its Representatives).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
and its Representatives may in any event (i) seek to clarify and understand
the terms and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by any Person and
(ii) inform a Person that has made or, to the knowledge of Parent, is
considering making, a Parent Acquisition Proposal of the provisions of this
_Section 8.04_.

(b) Except as permitted pursuant to this _Section 8.04(b)_, the Parent Board
shall not effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Parent
Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change if: (I) (A) a written Parent Acquisition Proposal that
was not solicited in violation of this Agreement is made to Parent by a Third
Party and such Parent Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the
date of such Parent Adverse Recommendation Change and (B) the Parent Board
concludes in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal; or (II) in all other cases
not involving a Parent Acquisition Proposal, in response to a Parent
Intervening Event to the extent that the Parent Board concludes in good faith,
after consultation with Parents outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Laws; _provided_ , that, in each case, prior to making any
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change:

(i) the Parent Board shall provide the Company at least three (3) Business
Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall include, in the case of _Section 8.04(b)(I)_, the information with
respect to the Parent Superior Proposal that is specified in _Section
8.04(c)_ as well as a copy of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, or, in the
case of _Section 8.04(b)(II)_, the reasons underlying the Parent Boards
decision to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change; and

 

(ii) during the three (3) Business Days following such written notice, the
Parent Board and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the
Company (to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate) regarding any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company; and at the
end of such three (3) Business Days, (a) the Parent Board concludes in
good faith, after consultation with Parents outside financial advisor and
outside legal counsel (and taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by the Company), that the
Parent Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Parent Superior Proposal (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or other
material terms of such Parent Superior Proposal shall require a new written
notification from Parent and a new period under clause (i) of this Section
8.04(b)) or (b) in all other cases not involving a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with
Parents outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel (and taking into
account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed
in writing by the Company), that the failure to make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Parent and the Company set forth in 
_Section 8.04(a)_ and _Section 8.04(b)_, Parent shall promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours)

 



64  advise the Company orally and in writing of any proposals or offers with
respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal that are received by Parent (or any
of its Representatives), indicating, in connection with such notice, the
identity of the Person or group of Persons making the proposal or offer and
the material terms and conditions of any such proposals or offers (including,
if applicable, copies of any written proposals or offers, including proposed
agreements) and thereafter shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a
prompt basis of any material changes to the status and material terms of any
such proposals or offers (including any material amendments thereto or
any change to the scope or material terms or conditions thereof, including
copies of definitive agreements).

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, but in all cases subject to _Section
8.04(a)_ and _Section 8.04(b)(i)_, shall prohibit the Parent Board from (i)
taking and disclosing to Parents stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to Parents stockholders if the
Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with Parents
outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that
this _Section 8.04(d)_ shall not permit the Parent Board to make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent otherwise permitted by this
_Section 8.04_.

of equity securities of Parent, (iv) any merger, consolidation, amalgamation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries that would result in any Person, directly or indirectly,
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of Parent
or (v) any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) " _Parent Adverse Recommendation Change_ " means any of the following
actions by the Parent Board: (i) withholding or withdrawing (or modifying in a
manner adverse to the Company) or proposing publicly to withhold or withdraw
(or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), the Parent Board
Recommendation, (ii) approving, recommending, or otherwise declaring to be
advisable or publicly proposing to approve, recommend or determine to be
advisable any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (iii) failing to include the Parent

against such Parent Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days after

(which request may be made only once with respect to each Parent Acquisition
Proposal).

 



65 (iii) " _Parent Intervening Event_ " means a material event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence that is not known or reasonably

event, fact, circumstance, development, occurrence, magnitude or material
consequence becomes known to or by the Parent Board prior to obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that if the Parent Intervening
Event relates to an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, then such event, fact,
circumstance, development or occurrence shall not constitute a Parent
Intervening Event unless it has a Company Material Adverse Effect; _provided
further_ , that in no event shall the following constitute a Parent
Intervening Event: (i) changes in the market price or trading volume of the
Parents securities or credit rating (it being understood that the facts and
occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Parent Intervening Event), and
(ii) the receipt, existence of or terms of a Parent Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiry relating thereto.

(iv) " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Parent
Acquisition Proposal from any Person (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) (with all references to "20% or more" in the
definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal being deemed to reference "50%
or more") that the Parent Board has determined in its good faith judgment
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable to its
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger after taking into
account the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the Merger)
and such other matters that the Parent Board deems relevant, including legal,
financial (including the financing terms of any such Parent Acquisition
Proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such Parent Acquisition Proposal.

Section 8.05 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be a joint press release in a form

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by applicable Laws or the rules or regulations of the NYSE or any
other regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject
or submits, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 8.05_ shall not apply to any release or announcement made or

Adverse Recommendation Change or by Parent in connection with and related to a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

representation, warranty, covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any
obligation of any Party hereunder or (ii) update any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, and  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the failure to comply with this _Section 8.06_ shall not
constitute a breach or noncompliance of a covenant by such Party for
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in  _Section 9.01_.

Section 8.07 _Access to Information_. (a) Upon reasonable notice, and subject
to applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford to the other Party, its Affiliates and its officers,

(including attorneys, accountants and financial advisors) reasonable access
during normal business hours, under direct supervision of a designated
employee of the disclosing Party, and upon reasonable prior notice to the
disclosing Party during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
and its Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records,

other information concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective
businesses, properties and personnel as such other Party may reasonably
request; _provided_ , that the disclosing Party may restrict the foregoing
access and the disclosure of information to the extent that, in the good faith
judgment of the disclosing Party, (i) any Law applicable to the disclosing
Party or its Subsidiaries requires the disclosing Party or its Subsidiaries
to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) the
information is subject to confidentiality obligations to a Third Party, (iii)
such disclosure would result in disclosure of any trade secrets of Third
Parties, (iv) disclosure of any such information or document could result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ , that the disclosing Party
and/or its counsel shall use their reasonable best efforts to enter into such
joint defense agreements or other arrangements, as appropriate, so as to allow
for such disclosure in a manner that does not result in the loss of attorney
client privilege) or (v) such access would unreasonably disrupt
the operations of the disclosing Party or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_
, that with respect to clauses (i) through (iv) of this _Section 8.07(a)_,
the disclosing Party shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to (A) obtain the required consent of such Third Party to provide such access
or disclosure or (B) develop an alternative to providing such information so
as to address such matters that is reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company. 

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to _Section 8.07(a)_,
each of Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause such
Partys Affiliates and officers, agents, control persons, employees,

and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 8.08  _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and

the Merger by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of

 



67  Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become

Litigation_ ") and shall keep such other Party reasonably informed on a
current basis with respect to the status thereof. Subject to the fiduciary
duties of each Partys board of directors and except in any litigation or
proceeding where the Parties may be adverse to each other, each Party shall
give the other Party the opportunity to participate, subject to a customary
joint defense agreement, in (but not control) the defense or settlement of
any Transaction Litigation, and no Party shall settle, agree to any
undertakings or approve or otherwise agree to any waiver that may be sought in
connection with such Transaction Litigation, without the prior
written consent of the other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

Section 8.10 _Certain Tax Matters_. Each Party shall, and shall cause each of
its respective Subsidiaries to, use reasonable efforts to obtain the tax
opinion referenced in Section 9.03(d). None of the Parties shall (and the
Parties shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to) take or fail to
take any action which action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected
to prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

Section 8.11 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and shall take,

and, in order to obtain such payment, the other Party commences a suit that
results in a judgment against such Party for any amount due pursuant to this

contrary (other than with respect to claims for, or arising out of or in
connection with fraud) (i) if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances
where the Termination Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement would be payable

Parent Expense Reimbursement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Party to which such amount is payable, its Subsidiaries, stockholders,
Affiliates, and current, former or future Representatives against the other
Party or any of its Representatives or Affiliates for, (ii) in no event will

contained in this Agreement. Except as required by applicable Law, no
waiver of this Agreement shall require the

on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The
failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall any single
or partial exercise by any Party of any of its rights under this Agreement
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights
under this Agreement.

the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the economic and legal substance
of the Merger, taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner materially
adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the

without such consent shall be null and void;  _provided_ , that Merger Sub
may assign, by written notice to the Company, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to another wholly owned direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Parent, in which event all references herein to
Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary (except with
respect to representations and warranties made herein with respect to Merger
Sub as of the date of this Agreement) and all representations and warranties
made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall
also be made with respect to such other Subsidiary as of the date of such
designation; _provided_ , that such assignment shall not relieve Parent of its
obligations hereunder or otherwise enlarge, alter or change any obligation of
any other party hereto or due to Parent or such other Subsidiary. This
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. __

adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the

by this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if

the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and (d) consents to
service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in
