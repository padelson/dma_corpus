term "Transactions";

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has approved this
Agreement and the Transactions;

WHEREAS, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
will qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), that this

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows: ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the " _MGCL_
"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue its corporate existence under the MGCL as the surviving corporation
in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP,
Washington, DC, at 10:00 a.m. local time, on the third business day after the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of the
conditions set forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) of
such conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and
Parent may agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on
the Closing Date, the Company and Merger Sub shall file the articles of merger
providing for the Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in a form mutually
agreed upon by Parent and the Company (acting reasonably), executed in
accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the MGCL, with the State Department of Assessments and
Taxation of Maryland (the " _SDAT_ "). The Merger shall become effective at
such time as the Articles of Merger are duly filed with and accepted for
record by the SDAT, or at such later time as is agreed by the parties hereto
and specified in the Articles of Merger in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the MGCL (such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the MGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and
all debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Company and Merger Sub
shall become the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving
Corporation, all as provided under the MGCL.

Section 1.5 _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the charter of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the charter of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof
and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in
_Section 5.11_; provided, however, that _Article Second _ of the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended in its entirety to
read as follows: "The name of the corporation is Allegheny Energy, Inc."



 

2 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and hereof
and applicable Law, in each case consistent with the obligations set forth in
_Section 5.11_. 

Section 1.6 _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualify, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 1.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation and shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualify, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 1.8 _Parent Board of Directors_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall take all necessary corporate action (i) to increase the size of the
Board of Directors of Parent by two members, such that at the Effective Time
the Board of Directors of Parent shall consist of 13 members, and (ii) to fill
the vacancies on the Board of Directors of Parent created by such increase, to
appoint to the Board of Directors of Parent, effective immediately after the
Effective Time, two directors consisting of current members of the Company
Board of Directors (the " _Designated Directors_ "), which Designated
Directors shall be designated by Parent, upon consultation with, and
consideration of the views of, the Company, before the mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement. If prior to the Effective Time, any Designated Director is
unwilling or unable to serve as a director of Parent as a result of illness,
death, resignation or any other reason, then, any replacement for such person
shall be selected by Parent, upon consultation with, and consideration of the
views of, the Company, and such replacement shall constitute a Designated
Director. The Designated Directors shall serve on committees of the Board of
Directors of Parent on an equitable basis proportionate to the size of the
Board of Directors of Parent.

ARTICLE II

_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or the holders
of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.1(b)_ ,
_2.1(d)_ and _5.7_ , each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $1.25 per share, of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such shares, collectively, " _Company Common Stock_ ," and
each, a " _Share_ "), other than any Cancelled Shares, shall thereupon be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive 0.667 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares
of common stock, par value $0.10 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), of
Parent (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As a result of the Merger, at the
Effective Time, each holder of Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of such Shares which are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of 



 

3  fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_, all to be issued or paid, without interest, in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Shares in accordance with _Section
2.2(b)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Share that is owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or
held by the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time (in each case, other than the Restricted Shares) (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
cancellation and retirement.

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation.
From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common
stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) _Fractional Shares_.

(i) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger,
but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.1(d)_, a cash
payment in lieu of such fractional share of Parent Common Stock representing
such holders proportionate interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by
the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to
such sale) in one or more transactions of shares of Parent Common Stock equal
to the excess of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_
representing the Merger Consideration over (B) the aggregate number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to the holders of Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ (such excess being herein called the " _Excess
Shares_ "). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as
agent for the holders of Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the then prevailing
prices on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided
in the following paragraph.



 

4 (ii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, shall be
executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall
be executed in round lots to the extent reasonably practicable. Until the net
proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of Shares,
the Exchange Agent shall hold such net proceeds in trust for the holders of
Shares that would otherwise receive fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
(the " _Common Shares Trust_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Shares shall be
entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds
comprising the Common Shares Trust (after the sale of all Excess Shares) by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional shares to
which such former holder of Shares would otherwise be entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional shares to which all
former holders of Shares would otherwise be entitled.

(iii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such
amounts to such former holders of Shares without interest, subject to and in
accordance with _Section 2.2_.

(e) _Adjustments to the Exchange Ratio_. If at any time during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company or Parent shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, or any
other similar event, then, provided that such event did not occur in violation
of this Agreement, the Exchange Ratio, the Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint its
transfer agent or such other exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for
the Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit
of holders of the Shares, the Restricted Shares, the Company Performance
Shares and Company RSUs, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (or appropriate alternative
arrangements shall be made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common
Stock will be issued). Following the Effective Time, Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient
to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.
All certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock (including the
amount of any dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_) are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."



 

5 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the fourth business day
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of Shares as of the Effective Time (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and that
risk of loss and title to the Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Shares to the Exchange Agent and which shall be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company) and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Shares in exchange for certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock (or appropriate alternative
arrangements made by Parent if uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock
will be issued), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_. Exchange of any Shares held in book entry form
shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary procedures
with respect to securities held in book entry form. Upon surrender of Shares
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of such Shares shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all Shares surrendered by such holder) to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (which shall be in
uncertificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is affirmatively
requested), payment by cash or check in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_, and the Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a
person other than the person in whose name the applicable surrendered Share
is registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Share be in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such delivery of the Merger Consideration pay any and all transfer
and other similar Taxes required to be paid as a result of such registration
in the name of a person other than the registered holder of such Share or
establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been
paid or are not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.2(b)_, each Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any amounts
to be paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_) upon such
surrender. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on or with respect to the
Merger Consideration or on or with respect to any amount payable pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Share with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented
thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_, until
such Share has been surrendered in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject
to applicable Laws, following surrender of any such Share, there shall be
paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such
surrender, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor pursuant to this  _Article II_ , together with any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(ii) at the 



 

6  appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock.

(d) _Withholdings_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold, from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable under this
Agreement to any holder of record of a Share immediately prior to the
Effective Time or any other person who is entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ , such amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld or deducted amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person(s) to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ and any
cash paid pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ or _Section 2.2(c)_ shall be deemed
to have been issued (or paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Shares. After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(f)  _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_ and any dividends or distributions pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.

(g)  _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation,
the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Lost Certificates_. If any certificate representing a Share shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may require as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional Shares to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(d)_ and any unpaid dividends
and distributions to 



 

7  which such holders are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_ as the case
may be, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

Except as disclosed in (a) the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (including exhibits; _provided_ that any representations and warranties
included in any such exhibit shall not be deemed to qualify any representation
or warranty in this Article III), (b) the draft Form 10-K (dated February 9,
2010) of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2009, a copy of which has
been previously furnished to Parent or (c) the disclosure schedule delivered
by the Company to Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") (provided that (a) with respect to the
Company SEC Documents or such draft Form 10-K: (i) any disclosures set forth
in any risk factor section, (ii) any disclosures in any section relating to
forward looking statements and (iii) any other disclosures included therein
that are predictive, non-specific or forward-looking in nature shall be
ignored and (b) any disclosure in the Company SEC Documents or such draft
Form 10-K shall be deemed to qualify any representation or warranty in this
_Article III_ only to the extent that such disclosure is made in such a way as
to make its relevance reasonably apparent on its face (but such Company SEC
Documents or draft Form 10-K shall in no event qualify the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.1, Section 3.2_ or _Section 3.3_)), the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc_.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets, to carry on
its business as presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is
in good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its
business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
organized, validly existing, qualified or in good standing, or to have such
power or authority, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a true and complete
copy of its charter and bylaws, each as amended through the date hereof and
which are in full force and effect (the " _Company Organizational Documents_
") and has made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement a
true and complete copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, each as
amended through the date hereof.

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each Subsidiary
of the Company and its jurisdiction of organization or formation and the
jurisdictions in which they are qualified to do business. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary of the Company have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each 



 

8  Subsidiary of the Company are owned by the Company, by one or more
Subsidiaries of the Company or by the Company and one or more Subsidiaries of
the Company, in each case free and clear of all Liens. Except for the capital
stock and other equity interests of its Subsidiaries, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or
other equity interest in any other person (including through participation in
any joint venture or similar arrangement), other than the ownership of
securities primarily for investment purposes as part of routine cash
management or investments of 2% or less in publicly traded companies, and
there are no Company Joint Ventures. " _Company Joint Venture_ " means any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other entity which is not a Subsidiary of the Company and in which (i) the
Company, directly or indirectly, owns or controls any shares of any class of
the outstanding voting securities or other equity interests (other than the
ownership of securities primarily for investment purposes as part of routine
cash management or investments of 2% or less in publicly traded companies) or
(ii) the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company is a general partner.

(c) As used in this Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means
an event, change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance, condition
or occurrence that is materially adverse to the business, condition (financial
or otherwise), properties, results of operations, liabilities, assets or
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the
ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions, but shall not be deemed
to include any event, change, effect, development, state of facts,
circumstance, condition or occurrence: (i) in or affecting the economy or the
financial, securities or commodities markets in the United States or elsewhere
in the world, the industry or industries in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries operate generally or in any specific jurisdiction or geographical
area or (ii) resulting from or arising out of (A) any changes or developments
in international, national, regional, state or local wholesale or retail
markets for electric power, capacity or fuel or related products including
those due to actions by competitors or due to changes in commodities prices or
hedging markets therefor, (B) any changes or developments in
national, regional, state or local electric transmission or distribution
systems or decreases in planned spending with respect thereto, including any
changes to projects required under PJMs Regional Transmission Expansion Plan
or Pennsylvanias Act 129, (C) the announcement or the existence of, or
compliance with, this Agreement or the Transactions, including possible Union
organizing activity, (D) any taking of any action at the written request of
Parent or Merger Sub, (E) any Action arising from allegations of breach of
fiduciary duty or other violation of applicable Law relating to this Agreement
or the Transactions, (F) any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal,
modification, reinterpretation or proposal of any rule, regulation,
ordinance, order, protocol or any other Law (including any Environmental Law)
of or by any national, regional, state or local Governmental Entity,
independent system operator, regional transmission organization or
market administrator, (G) any changes in GAAP or accounting standards or
interpretations thereof, (H) any weather-related or other force majeure event
or outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of war or terrorism, (I) the
consummation or non-consummation of the sale of the Companys electric
distribution operations in Virginia to Rappahannock Electric Cooperative and
Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative, or (J) any reduction in the credit
rating of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent attributable
to the expected consummation of the Merger but not to the extent attributable
to a change in the Companys or, as the case may be, such Subsidiarys
business, condition (financial or otherwise), properties, results of
operations, liabilities, assets or operations; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any event, change, 



 

9  effect, development, state of facts, circumstance, condition or occurrence
described in each of clauses (i) and (ii) B, G or H above shall not constitute
or give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect only if and to the extent
that such event, change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance,
condition or occurrence does not have a disproportionate effect on the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other similarly situated
participants in the utility industry; _provided further_ , _however_ , that
any event, change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance,
condition or occurrence described in clause (ii) A or F above shall not
constitute or give rise to a Company Material Adverse Effect only if and to
the extent that such event, change, effect, development, state of facts,
circumstance, condition or occurrence (x) does not have a
disproportionate effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to a hypothetical participant in the utility industry that
owns similar power generation assets (with respect to fuel type and location)
or (y) is the result of an increase in the generally prevailing price of
Northern Appalachian coal.

(a) The authorized stock of the Company consists of 260,000,000 shares of
Company Common Stock and no shares of preferred stock. As of February 5,

any pre-emptive right, purchase option, call, right of first refusal or any
similar right. No shares of Company Common Stock are held by any Subsidiary
of the Company. Except as set forth in this _Section 3.2(a)_, at the close
of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement, no shares of stock or voting securities of, or other equity
interests in, the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.

(b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, as of the date hereof, there
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible
securities or other similar rights, agreements or commitments relating to the
issuance or repurchase of capital stock or other equity interests to which

bound, obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) issue,

investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any

(c) There are outstanding no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the holders of which have the
right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities
having the right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on any matter. 

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
or registration of, or restricting any person from purchasing, selling,
pledging or otherwise disposing of, the capital stock or other equity interest
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent an accurate and
complete copy of the Company Stock Plans and the forms of Company Stock
Options, Restricted Shares, Company Performance Shares and Company RSUs
(collectively, " _Company Equity Awards_ "). There have been no repricings of

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

(a) The Company has requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to receipt of
the Company Stockholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of Directors
of the Company and, except for the Company Stockholder Approval, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the Merger or the consummation of the Transactions. As of the date hereof, the
Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously resolved to recommend that
the Companys stockholders approve this Agreement and the Transactions (the "
_Company Recommendation_ ") and directed that such matter be submitted for
consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, and such resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified
or withdrawn in any way. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the 



 

11  Company and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes the legal, valid and
binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and
(ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms
of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion

Securities Act of 1933 (the " _Securities Act_ "), (iv) the rules and
regulations of the NYSE, (v) the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act

Communications Commission (the " _FCC_ ") (collectively, the " _Company
Approvals_ "), and, subject to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in _Section 4.3(b)_, no authorization,
consent, order, license, permit or approval of, or registration, declaration,
notice or filing with, or action by, the United States, any state of the
United States or any foreign governmental or regulatory agency, commission,
court, panel, body, entity or authority (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is
necessary or required to be obtained or made under applicable Law in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company,
the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder or the
consummation of the Transactions by the Company, except for such
authorizations, consents, approvals or filings that, if not obtained or made,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and,
provided the Company Approvals are obtained, the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) conflict
with, result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any loan,
guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, right or license binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any liens, claims,
mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities or charges of
any kind (each, a " _Lien_ "), other than any such Lien (A) for Taxes or
governmental assessments, charges or claims of payment not yet due or
delinquent, being contested in good faith or for which adequate accruals or
reserves have been established, (B) which is a carriers, warehousemens,
mechanics, materialmens, repairmens or other similar lien arising in the
ordinary course of business, (C) which is disclosed on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Company or notes thereto or securing
liabilities reflected on such balance sheet, (D) which was incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent consolidated
balance sheet of the Company 



 

12  or (E) which does not and would not reasonably be expected to materially
impair the continued use and operation of the assets to which they relate as
operated as of the date hereof or any property at which the material
operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are conducted as of the
date hereof (each of the foregoing (A) through (E), a " _Company Permitted
Lien_ "), upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision
of the articles of restatement or bylaws or other equivalent organizational
document of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or
violate any applicable Laws, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii),
any such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.4 _SEC Reports, Financial Statements and Utility Reports_.

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2009 (the
" _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended,
as of the date of such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Company SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The
Companys disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably designed to

energy cost (" _ENEC_ ") clause in West Virginia) or (c) is a party to any
contract with any Governmental Entity entered into other than in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice imposing conditions on rates or services
in effect as of the date hereof or which, to the knowledge of the Company,
are as of the date hereof scheduled to go into effect at a later time, except
in the case of clauses (a) through (c) that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.23 _Intellectual Property_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries own or have a valid right to use all
patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, and
any applications and registrations therefor, technology, 



 

23  trade secrets, know-how, computer software and tangible and intangible
proprietary information and materials (collectively, " _Intellectual Property
Rights_ ") used in connection with and reasonably necessary for the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. To the Companys
knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has infringed,
misappropriated or violated in any material respect any Intellectual Property
Rights of any third party except where such infringement, misappropriation or
violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. To the Companys knowledge, no
third party is infringing, misappropriating or violating any Intellectual
Property Rights owned or exclusively licensed by or to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except where such infringement, misappropriation
or violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.24 _Properties_. The Company or its applicable Subsidiary has (a)
good and insurable title or (b) good and valid leasehold interest in and to
each material parcel of real property owned or leased, as applicable, by the

would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.25 _Material Contracts_. As of the date hereof, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any Contract that (i)
is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC), (ii) would, after giving effect to the
Merger, limit or restrict the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or any successor thereto, from engaging or competing in any line
of business that it currently engages in or is a reasonable extension thereof
(including with respect to Parent after the Effective Time) or in any
geographic area or contains exclusivity or non-solicitation provisions with
respect to customers, (iii) limits or otherwise restricts the ability of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to
its stockholders, or (iv) provides for the operation or management of any
operating assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries by any person other than
the Company or its Subsidiaries. Each Contract of the type described in this 
_Section 3.25_, whether or not set forth on _Section 3.25_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule and whether or not entered into on or prior to the date
hereof, is referred to herein as a " _Company Material Contract_ ". Each
Company Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or
its Subsidiary party thereto enforceable against the Company or its Subsidiary
party thereto in accordance with its terms (except that (i) such enforcement
may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of
specific performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may
be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceeding therefor may be brought) and, to the Companys knowledge,

Company and each of its Subsidiaries which is a party thereto has performed in
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it to the
date hereof under each Company Material Contract and, to the Companys
knowledge, each other party to each Company Material Contract has performed in
all material respects all obligations required to be performed by it under
such Company Material Contract, except, in each case, as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
knowledge of, or has received notice 



 

24  of, any violation of or default under (or any condition which with the
passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or
default under) any Company Material Contract to which it is a party or by
which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or, after giving effect to
the Merger, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. " _Contract_ " or " _contract_ "
means any written agreement, undertaking, contract, commitment, lease,
license, permit, franchise, concession, deed of trust, contract, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, arrangement or other instrument or obligation.

Section 3.26 _No Additional Representations_. The Company acknowledges that
neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation or warranty as to any
matter whatsoever except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by Parent or Merger Sub to the Company in accordance
with the terms hereof, and specifically (but without limiting the generality
of the foregoing) that neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes any representation
or warranty with respect to (a) any projections, estimates or budgets
delivered or made available to the Company (or any of their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, employees or Representatives) of future
revenues, results of operations (or any component thereof), cash flows or
financial condition (or any component thereof) of Parent and its Subsidiaries
or (b) the future business and operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries in
each case except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE IV

_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB_

Except as disclosed in (a) the Parent SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (including exhibits; _provided_ that any representations and warranties
included in any such exhibit shall not be deemed to qualify any representation
or warranty in this Article IV), (b) the draft Form 10-K (dated February 5,
2010) of Parent for the year ended December 31, 2009, a copy of which has been
previously furnished to the Company or (c) the disclosure schedule delivered
by Parent to the Company immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement
(the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ "), (provided that (a) with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents or such draft Form 10-K: (i) any disclosures set forth in
any risk factor section, (ii) any disclosures in any section relating to
forward looking statements and (iii) any other disclosures included therein
that are predictive, non-specific or forward-looking in nature shall be
ignored and (b) any disclosure in the Parent SEC Documents or such draft Form
10-K shall be deemed to qualify any representation or warranty in this
_Article IV_ only to the extent that such disclosure is made in such a way as
to make its relevance reasonably apparent on its face (but such Parent SEC
Documents or draft Form 10-K shall in no event qualify the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 4.1_, _Section 4.2_ or _Section 4.3_)),
Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1 _Qualification; Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, 



 

25  lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing as
a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available to the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement a true and complete copy of its articles of
incorporation and bylaws, each as amended through the date hereof and which
are in full force and effect (the " _Parent Organizational Documents_ ") and
has made available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement a true
and complete copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub, each as amended through the date hereof.

(b) _Section 4.1(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists each Subsidiary
of Parent and its jurisdiction of organization or formation and the
jurisdictions in which they are qualified to do business. All of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each
Subsidiary of Parent have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
interests of each Subsidiary of Parent are owned by Parent, by one or more
Subsidiaries of Parent or by Parent and one or more Subsidiaries of Parent, in
each case free and clear of all Liens. Except for the capital stock and other
equity interests of its Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries owns, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other equity
interest in any other person (including through participation in any joint
venture or similar arrangement), other than the ownership of securities
primarily for investment purposes as part of routine cash management or
investments of 2% or less in publicly traded companies, and there are no
Parent Joint Ventures. " _Parent Joint Venture_ " means any corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity
which is not a Subsidiary of Parent and in which (i) Parent, directly or
indirectly, owns or controls any shares of any class of the outstanding
voting securities or other equity interests (other than the ownership of
securities primarily for investment purposes as part of routine cash
management or investments of 2% or less in publicly traded companies) or (ii)
Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent is a general partner.

(c) As used in this Agreement, a " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means
an event, change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance, condition
or occurrence that is materially adverse to the business, condition (financial
or otherwise), properties, results of operations, liabilities, assets or
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the ability
of Parent to consummate the Transactions but shall not be deemed to include
any event, change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance,
condition or occurrence: (i) in or affecting the economy or the financial,
securities or commodities markets in the United States or elsewhere in the
world, the industry or industries in which Parent or its Subsidiaries
operate generally or in any specific jurisdiction or geographical area or
(ii) resulting from or arising out of (A) any changes or developments in
international, national, regional, state or local wholesale or retail markets
for electric power, capacity or fuel or related products, including those due
to actions by competitors or due to changes in commodities prices or hedging
markets therefor, (B) any changes or developments in national, regional, state
or local electric transmission or distribution systems or decreases in
planned spending with respect thereto, including any changes to projects
required under PJMs Regional Transmission Expansion Plan or 



 

26  Pennsylvanias Act 129, (C) the announcement or the existence of, or
compliance with, this Agreement or the Transactions, including possible Union
organizing activity, (D) any taking of any action at the written request of
the Company, (E) any Action arising from allegations of breach of fiduciary
duty or other violation of applicable Law relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, (F) any adoption, implementation, promulgation, repeal,
modification, reinterpretation or proposal of any rule, regulation, ordinance,
order, protocol or any other Law (including any Environmental Law) of or by
any national, regional, state or local Governmental Entity, independent
system operator, regional transmission organization or market administrator,
(G) any changes in GAAP or accounting standards or interpretations thereof,
(H) any weather-related or other force majeure event or outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or acts of war or terrorism or (I) any reduction in
the credit rating of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent
attributable to the expected consummation of the Merger but not to the extent
attributable to a change in Parents or, as the case may be, such
Subsidiarys business, condition (financial or otherwise), properties, results
of operations, liabilities, assets or operations; provided, however, that any
event, change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance, condition
or occurrence described in each of clauses (i) and (ii)A, B, F, G or H above
shall not constitute or give rise to a Parent Material Adverse Effect only if
and to the extent that such event, change, effect, development, state of
facts, circumstance, condition or occurrence does not have a disproportionate
effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other
similarly situated participants in the utility industry. 

Section 4.2 _Capital Stock_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Parent consists of 375,000,000 shares of

the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the date of
this Agreement, no shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, Parent were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.

(b) Except as set forth in subsection (a) above, as of the date hereof, there
are no outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the holders of which have the right to vote
(or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right
to vote) with the shareholders of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries on any
matter.

(d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting or
registration of, or restricting any person from purchasing, selling, pledging
or otherwise disposing of, the capital stock or other equity interest of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) Parent has delivered or made available to the Company an accurate and
complete copy of all employee and director stock plans of Parent and the forms
of options to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock (" _Parent Stock Options_
"), restricted share units and phantom shares with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock (collectively, " _Parent Equity Awards_ "). There have
been no repricings of any Parent Stock Options through amendments,
cancellation and reissuance or other means during the current or prior two
calendar years. None of the Parent Stock Options was granted with an exercise
price below or deemed to be below fair market value on the date of grant. All
grants of Parent Equity Awards were validly made and properly approved by the
Board of Directors of Parent (or a duly authorized committee or subcommittee
thereof) in compliance with all applicable Laws and properly recorded on the
consolidated financial statements of Parent in accordance with GAAP, and,
where applicable, no such grants involved any "back dating," "forward dating"
or similar practices with respect to grants of Parent Stock Options.

(f) All outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and all outstanding Parent
Stock Options have been issued and granted in compliance with (i) all
applicable Laws and (ii) all requirements set forth in contracts applicable to

of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Parent or a direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub
has outstanding no option, warrant, right or any other agreement pursuant to
which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity security of Merger
Sub. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the date hereof and
has, and prior to the Effective Time 



 

28  will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than
those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the
Transactions.

Section 4.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to this Agreement; No Violation_.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and,
subject to receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval, to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by the
Boards of Directors of Parent and Merger Sub and by Parent, as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub, and, except for the Parent Shareholder Approval, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary
to authorize the Merger, the Stock Issuance or the consummation of the
Transactions. As of the date hereof, the Board of Directors of Parent has
unanimously resolved to recommend (the " _Parent Recommendation_ ") that
Parents shareholders approve the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock
in connection with the Merger (the " _Stock Issuance_ ") and an amendment to
Parents articles of incorporation providing for an increase in the authorized
capital stock of Parent to 495,000,000 shares (the " _Charter Amendment_ "),
and such resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes
the legal, valid and binding agreement of the Company, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with
its terms, except that (i) such enforcement may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws, now
or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights generally and (ii)
equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of
the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.

(b) Other than in connection with or in compliance with (i) the provisions of
Ohio General Corporation Law, (ii) the Exchange Act, (iii) the Securities
Act, (iv) the rules and regulations of the NYSE, (v) the HSR Act, (vi) the FPA
and the FERC Approval, (vii) to the extent required, the rules and regulations
of the Applicable PSCs and (viii) the matters set forth on _Section 4.3(b)_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the " _Parent Approvals_ "),
no authorization, consent, order, license, permit or approval of, or
registration, declaration, notice or filing with, or action by, any
Governmental Entity is necessary or required to be obtained or made under
applicable Law in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent and Merger Sub, the performance by Parent and Merger Sub of their
respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions by
Parent and Merger Sub, except for such authorizations, consents, approvals or
filings, that, if not obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do
not, and, provided the Parent Approvals are obtained, the consummation of the
Transactions and compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) conflict
with, result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any 



 

29  loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
result in the creation of any Lien, other than any such Lien (A) for Taxes or
governmental assessments, charges or claims of payment not yet due or
delinquent, being contested in good faith or for which adequate accruals or
reserves have been established, (B) which is a carriers, warehousemens,
mechanics, materialmens, repairmens or other similar lien arising in the
ordinary course of business, (C) which is disclosed on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of Parent or notes thereto or securing liabilities
reflected on such balance sheet, (D) which was incurred in the ordinary course
of business since the date of the most recent consolidated balance sheet of
the Company or (E) which does not and would not reasonably be expected to
materially impair the continued use and operation of the assets to which they
relate as operated as of the date hereof or any property at which the
material operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are conducted as of
the date hereof (each of the foregoing (A) through (E), a " _Parent Permitted
Lien_ "), upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in any violation of any provision
of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent organizational
document of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or
violate any applicable Laws, other than, in the case of clauses (i) and
(iii), any such violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation,
acceleration, right, loss or Lien that would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _SEC Reports, Financial Statements and Utility Reports_.

(a) Parent has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to
be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since January 1, 2009 (the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the
date of such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the Parent SEC Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

(b) Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act),
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files
or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated
to Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and all such required
certifications have been made. Parents management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2008, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective.



 

30 (c) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules)
of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents complied as to form in all
material respects with the rules and regulations of the SEC then in effect,
fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated results of their operations and their
consolidated cash flows for the respective periods then ended (subject, in
the case of the unaudited statements, to normal recurring year-end audit
adjustments that were not or are not expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse to the Company), and were prepared in accordance
with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except

Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the " _Atomic Energy Act_ ") and any
applicable state public utility commissions and under applicable state law, as
the case may be, have been made, including all forms, statements, reports,
agreements and all documents, exhibits, amendments and supplements
appertaining thereto, including all rates, tariffs, franchises, service
agreements, and related documents, and all such filings complied, as of their
respective dates, with all applicable requirements of applicable statutes and
the rules and regulations thereunder, except for filings the failure of which
to make or the failure of which to make in compliance with all applicable
requirements of applicable statutes and the rules and regulations thereunder,
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract (including any contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose
or intended effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or affiliates.

Section 4.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except (a) as reflected or reserved
against in Parents most recent audited consolidated balance sheets (or
stated in the notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents and (b) for
liabilities and obligations incurred since January 1, 2009 in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, and neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether
or not accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto) other than those which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.



 

31 Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1,
2009 through the date of this Agreement, there has not been any event,
change, effect, development, state of facts, circumstance, condition or
occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

properties at law or in equity before, and (c) there are no orders, judgments
or decrees of, or before, any Governmental Entity except, in the case of
clauses (a) through (c), as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.8 _Information Supplied_. None of the information provided or to be
provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 is filed with the
SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; _provided_ , that,
with respect to projected financial information provided by or on behalf of
Parent, Parent represents only that such information was prepared in good
faith by management of Parent on the basis of assumptions believed by such
management to be reasonable as of the time made. None of the information
provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Joint Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to
Parents shareholders or the Companys stockholders at the time of the Parent
Shareholders Meeting or the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , that, with respect to projected financial information
provided by or on behalf of Parent, Parent represents only that such
information was prepared in good faith by management of Parent on the

thereof relating solely to the Company Stockholders Meeting) and the Form S-4
will comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.8_, no
representation or warranty is made by Parent with respect to information or
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or the Joint
Proxy Statement that were not supplied by or on behalf of Parent.

Material Adverse Effect. Within the past three years, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to Parents

its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets or to
carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent

Section 4.14  _Operations of Nuclear Power Plants_. The operations of the
nuclear generation stations owned, in whole or part, by Parent or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Parent Nuclear Facilities_ ") are and have
been conducted in compliance with all applicable Laws and Parent Permits,
except for such failures to comply that would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Parent Nuclear Facilities maintains, and is in material compliance
with, emergency plans designed to respond to an unplanned release therefrom of
radioactive materials and each such plan conforms with the requirements of
applicable Laws in all material respects. The plans for the decommissioning
of each of the Parent Nuclear Facilities and for the storage of spent nuclear
fuel generated or expected to be generated at each Parent Nuclear Facility, in
each case, conform with the requirements of applicable Laws in all material
respects, and solely with respect to the portion of the Parent Nuclear
Facilities owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent, funded consistent with
applicable Laws. The Department of Energy has taken possession of the spent
nuclear fuel from TMI-2 pursuant to a contract between a Subsidiary of
Parent, GPU Nuclear, Inc., and the Department of Energy. To the knowledge of
Parent, there are no unpaid claims by the Department of Energy against Parent
or its Subsidiaries relating to the disposal of TMI-2 spent nuclear fuel. The
operations of the Parent Nuclear Facilities are not the subject of any
outstanding notices of violation, any ongoing proceeding, heightened or
additional inspections above the NRC baseline inspection program or requests
for information from the NRC or any other agency with jurisdiction over such
facility, except for such notices, proceedings, inspections or requests for
information that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
Parent Nuclear Facility is listed by the NRC in the Unacceptable Performance
column of the NRC Action Matrix, as a part of NRCs Assessment of Plant
Performance. Liability insurance to the full extent required by applicable
Law for operating the Parent Nuclear Facilities remains in full force and
effect regarding such facilities, except for failures to maintain such
insurance in full force and effect that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has paid or is obligated to pay all or part
of the premiums, as of the date hereof. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice of any pending or threatened cancellation or
premium increase (retroactive or otherwise) with respect thereto, and Parent
and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with
all conditions contained therein. From and after January 1, 2009, Parent and

operate.

Section 4.16 _Trading_. Parent has established risk parameters, limits and
guidelines in compliance with the risk management policy approved by Parents
Board of Directors (the

its Subsidiaries are authorized to take with respect to, among other things,
the net position resulting from all physical commodity transactions,
exchange-traded futures and options transactions, over-the-counter
transactions and derivatives thereof and similar transactions (the " _Net
Parent Position_ ") and monitors compliance by Parent and its Subsidiaries
with such Parent Trading Policies. Parent has provided the Parent Trading
Policies to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. At no time
between September 30, 2009 and the date of this Agreement, (i) has the Net
Parent Position not been within the risk parameters that are set forth in the
Parent Trading Policies or (ii) has the exposure of Parent and its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Net Parent Position resulting from all such
transactions been material to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
From December 31, 2008 to the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has, in accordance with generally recognized mark to
market accounting policies, experienced an aggregate net loss in its trading
and related operations that would be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole.

doubt, any shares of Company Common Stock that may be held by Parent Benefit
Plans), and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any rights to
acquire any shares of Company Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement.

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.23 _Intellectual Property_. Except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, Parent and its Subsidiaries own or have a valid right to use all
Intellectual Property Rights used in connection with and reasonably necessary

Parents knowledge, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has infringed,
misappropriated or violated in any material respect any Intellectual Property
Rights of any third party except where such infringement, misappropriation or
violation would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To Parents knowledge, no third
party is infringing, misappropriating or violating any Intellectual Property
Rights owned or exclusively licensed by or to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where such infringement, misappropriation or violation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a

to the date hereof, is referred to herein as a " _Parent Material Contract_."
Each Parent Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Parent
or its Subsidiary party thereto enforceable against Parent or its Subsidiary
party thereto in accordance with its terms (except that (i) such enforcement
may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to
creditors rights generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be subject

default under) any Parent Material Contract to which it is a party or by which
it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for violations or
defaults that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or, after giving effect to

Section 5.3 _Investigation_.



 

53 (a) Each of the Company and Parent shall afford the other party and (x) the
officers and employees and (y) the accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financial advisors and agents and other representatives (such persons
described in this clause (y), collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of such
other party reasonable access during normal business hours, throughout the
period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to
its and its Subsidiaries personnel and properties, contracts, commitments,
books and records and any report, schedule or other document filed or
received by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and with such
additional accounting, financing, operating and other data and information
regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably request,
and Parent and its Subsidiaries, as the Company may reasonably request, as the
case may be. Consistent with applicable Law, each of Parent and the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Subsidiaries to, (i) confer, on
a reasonable basis, with one or more representatives of the other party to
discuss material operational and regulatory matters and the general status of
its ongoing operations for purposes related to the completion of
the Transactions (including a partys assessment of the proper accounting for
such transactions, any public disclosures that a party is required to make
regarding such transactions and reasonable access to management and systems
needed for integration planning) or the fulfillment of its obligations under
this Agreement and (ii) furnish promptly all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel, in each case as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with activities relating to the completion
of the Transactions or the fulfillment of its obligations under this
Agreement. The Company shall afford Parent and its officers, employees and
Representatives access to the Companys and its Subsidiaries properties for
the purpose of performing environmental site assessments, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such assessments shall not include environmental sampling or
testing unless expressly authorized by the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent shall be required to afford the
access described in this _Section 5.3_ if it would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation
of any agreement to which such party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable Law.

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions shall
be deemed to be " _Proprietary Information_ ," as such term is used in, and
shall be treated in accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of January 8, 2010, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

Section 5.4 _Non-Solicitation by the Company_.

any of their respective officers, directors or employees, shall, and that it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective
Representatives not to (and shall not authorize or permit its and their
respective Representatives to), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit,
initiate, seek or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate any
inquiries or the making, submission or announcement of any Company
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish any nonpublic information regarding the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub) 



 

54  in connection with or in response to a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any person
(other than Parent or Merger Sub) with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve, endorse or recommend any Company Acquisition Proposal
or (v) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or other
agreement providing for any Company Acquisition Transaction (except as
contemplated by _Section 7.1(j)_); _provided_ , _however_ , that this
_Section 5.4_ shall not prohibit (A) the Company, or the Board of Directors
of the Company, directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or
Representative, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, or entering into or participating in discussions
or negotiations with, any person in response to an unsolicited, bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of the
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors, constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior
Offer if (1) the Board of Directors of the Company concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise by the Board of
Directors of their duties under applicable Laws, (2) such Company Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of this  _Section 5.4(a)_ (other than
any such breach that is unintentional and immaterial in effect), (3) the
Company gives to Parent the notice required by _Section 5.4(b)_, and (4) the
Company furnishes any nonpublic information provided to the maker of the
Company Acquisition Proposal only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
between the Company and such person on terms no less favorable to the Company
than the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such confidentiality
agreement shall not in any way restrict the Company from complying with its
disclosure obligations under this Agreement, including with respect to such
proposal), and such furnished information is delivered to Parent
at substantially the same time (to the extent such information has not been
previously furnished or made available by the Company to Parent); or (B) the
Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to any Company Acquisition Proposal, _provided_ , _however_ , that
compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or modify the effect
that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any other provision of
this Agreement and in no event shall the Company or the Company Board of
Directors or a committee thereof take any action that would constitute a
Company Change in Recommendation in respect of a Company Acquisition Proposal
other than in compliance with _Section 5.4(d)_.

of the person making or submitting such Company Acquisition Proposal or
request, and, (x) if it is in writing, a copy of such Company

reasonably detailed summary of any such Company Acquisition Proposal or
request that is made or submitted by any person during the period between the
date hereof and the Closing. The Company shall (i) keep Parent informed in
all material respects on a prompt basis with respect to any change to the
status or material terms of any such Company Acquisition Proposal (and in no

as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company from
any third

Acquisition Proposal and (iii) provide Parent with advance written notice of
any scheduled meeting of the Company Board of Directors to discuss a Company
Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors and
employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any
discussions existing as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or Representatives and any person (other than Parent) that relate
to any Company Acquisition Proposal and, to the extent provided by the
applicable confidentiality agreement or similar agreement governing such
discussions, require any third party to such discussions to return to
the Company or to destroy all confidential information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. The Company agrees not to, and to cause its Subsidiaries not to,
waive, or otherwise release any third party from, the confidentiality and
standstill provisions of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may become a party and agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of such agreements.

(d) Except as contemplated by this _Section 5.4(d)_, neither the Board of
Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or resolve to or publicly propose to withhold,

Stockholders Meeting or this Agreement or the Transactions inconsistent with
the Company Recommendation, (C) approve, adopt or recommend any Company
Acquisition Proposal or (D) fail to reaffirm or re-publish the

or publicly propose to approve, adopt or recommend, a merger agreement,
letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset
purchase agreement, share exchange agreement, option agreement or other
similar contract (other than the confidentiality agreement referred to in
_Section 5.4(a)_) or any tender offer providing for, with respect to, or in
connection with any Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company may at any time prior to
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, in respect of a Company
Acquisition Proposal, (i) make a Company Change of Recommendation and (ii)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_ of this Agreement, if
(and only if): (A) a Company Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company by a

under applicable Laws, (D) the Company Board of Directors has provided to

"neutral" is a Company Change of Recommendation.

faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise by
the Board of Directors of its duties under applicable Laws if (and only if):
(A) the Company Board of Directors has provided to Parent five business days
prior written notice of its intent to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation (which notice shall include the reasonable details regarding

favor of the adoption of this Agreement and to take all other action necessary

shareholders approve the Stock Issuance and the Charter Amendment, and will
use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor
of the Stock Issuance and the Charter Amendment and to take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its
shareholders required by the rules of the NYSE or applicable Laws to obtain
such approval.

(c) Each of the Company and Parent will use reasonable best efforts to hold
the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Shareholders Meeting,
respectively, on the same date as the other party and as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement.

 

(d) The Company shall take all action necessary to comply timely with
applicable notification requirements under applicable Law in respect of any
Company Benefit Plan holding Company Common Stock, including causing any
Company Benefit Plan administrator to issue any such notices.

Section 5.7 _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards; Employee Matters_.

(a) _Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(i) Each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Company Stock Option_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans
of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be amended and converted into an option to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such Company Stock Option (giving
effect to any terms and conditions resulting from the Transactions), the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option and the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise
price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to 



 

63  the quotient obtained by dividing the aggregate exercise price for the
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by the
Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an " _Adjusted Option_ "). The
adjustments provided in this _Section 5.7(a)(i)_ with respect to any Company
Stock Option to which Section 409A or 421(a) of the Code applies shall be and
are intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with Section 409A
and 424(a) of the Code, respectively. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted Options
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
respective Company Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the grants of
such Adjusted Options, which shall provide, among other things, that such
Adjusted Options and agreements have been assumed by Parent and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this _Section 5.7(a)(i)_ after giving effect to the
Merger and giving effect to any terms and conditions resulting from the
Transactions). 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted Company Common Stock
granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Restricted Shares_ ") shall, automatically and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
right to receive, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under
such Restricted Shares (giving effect to any terms and conditions resulting
from the Transactions), a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (and cash in
lieu of fractional shares), restricted, as applicable after giving effect to
any terms and conditions resulting from the Transactions, equal to the product
of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
grant of Restricted Shares and (B) the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , that,
unless the holder shall have remitted to the Company the amount required to be
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be reduced by a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law divided by the volume weighted average per-share trading
price of Parent Common Stock on the NYSE on the five trading days trailing the
Closing Date (the " _Parent Stock Conversion Price_ ") and the Surviving
Corporation shall be responsible for timely and properly remitting any such
withholdings to the proper taxing authority.

(iii) Effective as of the Effective Time, each award of performance shares
(the " _Company Performance Shares_ ") or restricted stock units (the "
_Company RSUs_ ") with respect to shares of Company Common Stock under a
Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be converted, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Performance Shares or Company RSUs (giving effect to any
terms and conditions resulting from the Transactions), into the right to
receive from Parent a 



 

64  number of performance shares or stock units, restricted as applicable after
giving effect to any terms and conditions resulting from the Transactions, in
respect of Parent Common Stock (and cash in lieu of fractional shares) equal
to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such grant of Company Performance Shares or Company RSUs at the
target level of performance and (B) the Exchange Ratio;  _provided_ , that,
unless the holder shall have remitted to the Company the amount required to be
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, such number of shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be reduced by a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the amount required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax Law divided by the Parent Stock Conversion Price (and the
Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for timely and properly remitting
any such withholdings to the proper taxing authority).

(iv) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall pass resolutions to effect
the foregoing provisions of this  _Section 5.7(a)_.

(v) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall prepare
and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
issuance upon the exercise of the Adjusted Options, and substitute restricted
shares, performance shares and stock units in respect of Parent Common Stock
issuable in accordance with subsections (ii) and (iii) of this _Section
5.7(a)_. The Company shall cooperate with, and assist Parent in the
preparation of, such registration statement. Parent shall keep such
registration statement effective (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus required thereby) for so long as any Adjusted Options, substitute
restricted shares, performance shares and stock units in respect of Parent
Common Stock remain outstanding.

(b) _Employee Matters_.

(i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall honor or cause the Surviving Corporation to continue to honor
all Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time, _provided_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit
Parent or the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Company Benefit Plans, arrangements or agreements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or from
terminating the employment of any Company Employee to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws. For a period of at least one year following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current and
former Company Employee, other than such employees covered by collective
bargaining agreements, compensation and employee benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation and benefits provided to
current and former 



 

65  Company Employees (as the case may be) immediately before the Effective
Time; provided that Parent shall be entitled to make modifications thereto to
the extent such modifications do not result in compensation and benefits for
the Company Employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements that are
less favorable in the aggregate than that which is then provided to similarly
situated Parent Employees not covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the
Surviving Corporation nor any of its affiliates shall reduce the rate at which
any Company Employee, who immediately prior to the Effective Time earned
at least five (5) weeks paid vacation per year, earns paid vacation time
after the Effective Time; _provided_ that there shall be no obligation to
increase the rate at which such Company Employee earns vacation to a rate
greater than that in effect for such Company Employee immediately before the
Effective Time.

(ii) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and accrual and
level of benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective
Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited for his
or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such
service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time, _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
or to benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (A) Parent shall cause
each Company Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan set forth on _Section 3.11(a)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") and (B) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which such employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall cause
any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.



 

66 (iii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries, following the Effective Time, to honor, without modification,
all contracts, agreements, collective bargaining agreements and commitments of
the parties prior to or at the date hereof or made herein or permitted to be
entered into prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement which
apply to any current or former employee or current or former director of the
Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that this undertaking is not intended to
prevent the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries from enforcing such
contracts, agreements, collective bargaining agreements and commitments in
accordance with their terms, including any reserved right to amend, modify,
suspend, revoke or terminate any such contract, agreement, collective
bargaining agreement or commitment.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and subject
to the provisions of _Section 5.7(b)(i)_, for a period of at least one year
following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide severance benefits on an
individual-by-individual basis that are no less favorable to
Company Employees than the severance benefits provided to such Company
Employees under the Companys severance programs as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(v) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.7(b)(ii)_, if an applicable
Company Benefit Plan is terminated in which non-bargaining unit employees of
the Company or its Subsidiaries participate, Parent shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to:

(A) permit such employees to participate in any similar plan established by
Parent in a manner substantially similar to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, recognizing that the availability, providers or
benefit levels of such plan established by Parent may reflect differing
circumstances;

(B) waive any pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to the applicable plan of Parent; and

(C) provide that any expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time by any
such employee or any such employees covered dependent shall be taken into
account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket provisions with respect to the applicable plan of
Parent.

(vi) Parent shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to:

(A) allow, after the Effective Time such employees to use the remaining amount
of accrued but unused vacation and sick leave such employees were entitled
immediately prior to the Effective Time;



 

67 (B) allow such employees to participate, as soon as practical, in all
job placement, job posting, job training, career development and educational
programs of Parent and its Subsidiaries; and

(C) consider such employees for positions at Parent and its Subsidiaries
resulting from the Merger using criteria including previous work history, job
experience and qualifications.

Section 5.8 _Regulatory Approvals; Third-Party Consents; Reasonable Best
Efforts._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in
accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals, including the Company Approvals
and the Parent Approvals, from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary
consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries be required to
pay (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not pay or agree to pay more
than $17.5 million in the aggregate without Parents prior written consent),
prior to the Effective Time, any fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party under any contract or agreement for any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the Transactions.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) as promptly as practicable,
but in no event later than 10 business days after filing with the FERC an
application for the FERC Approval, make their respective filings and
thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act, (ii) use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (A) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers or approvals are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions
and (B) timely making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents,
permits, authorizations or approvals, (iii) subject to _Section 5.8(d)_, use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions
and do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective the Transactions, including taking all such
further action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the
FERC, the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "),
the Applicable PSCs or competition authorities of any other nation may assert
under Regulatory Law with respect to the Transactions so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later
than the End Date), including (A) 



 

68  proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such
assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or affiliates or of the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (B) otherwise taking or committing to take
actions that after the Closing Date would limit Parents or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) or its affiliates freedom of action
with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of its or its
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, product
lines or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid the entry
of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would otherwise have the
effect of preventing or materially delaying the Closing, and (iv) subject to
applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
keep each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion
of the transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of notices or other communications received by the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from
any third party or any Governmental Entity with respect to such
transactions. The Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to file applications for approval with the FERC and the
Applicable PSCs as promptly as practicable after the date hereof. The Company
and Parent shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transactions unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.8_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of
this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.8_ shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _7.1(c)_ so long as
such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its obligations under
this Agreement, including this _Section 5.8_.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, "reasonable
best efforts" shall not require, any party to (i) sell, or agree to sell, hold
or agree to hold separate, or otherwise dispose or agree to dispose of any
asset, or conduct or agree to conduct its business in any particular manner,
or take any other action, as may be required to resolve objections if any, of
the FERC, the FTC, or the DOJ, in each case if such sale, separation or
disposition, agreement, conduct or action with respect thereto would (a)
individually or in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect (without giving effect to the Merger) or (b)
individually or in the aggregate (giving effect to any such actions required
by the Applicable PSCs) reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect (determined after giving 



 

69  effect to the Merger) or (ii) sell, or agree to sell, hold or agree to hold
separate, or otherwise dispose or agree to dispose of any asset, or conduct or
agree to conduct its business in any particular manner, or take any other
action, as may be required to resolve objections, if any, of the Applicable
PSCs, in each case if such sale, separation or disposition, agreement, conduct
or action with respect thereto would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent
Material Adverse Effect ( _provided_ that for purposes of determining whether
a potential adverse effect would constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect
for purposes of this clause (ii), Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, shall be deemed to be a consolidated group of entities of the size and
scale of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole). The Company and
Parent will consult with each other prior to agreeing to any merger
requirements sought by any state regulator. Nothing in this _Section 5.8_
shall obligate Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
to take any action that is not conditioned on the Closing.

(e) As used in this Agreement, " _Regulatory Law_ " means the Sherman Act of
1890 as amended, the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 as amended, the HSR Act,
the FPA, the Atomic Energy Act, the rules and regulations of the Applicable
PSCs and all other federal, state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations,
orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other Laws,
including any antitrust, competition or trade regulation Laws, that are
designed or intended to (i) prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition or (ii) protect the national
security or the national economy of any nation.

Section 5.9 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may purport
to be, applicable to the Transactions, each of the Company and Parent shall
grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so
that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on the Transactions. 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to a Company Change
of Recommendation or Parent Change of Recommendation or any action taken by
the Company or Parent or their Boards of Directors pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 5.4_ or _Section 5.5_, respectively, so long as
this Agreement is in effect, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
announcement relating to this Agreement or the Transactions and, except for
any press release or public announcement as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, shall use reasonable efforts not to issue any such press release or
make any such public announcement without consulting the other parties. Parent
and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable initial joint press
release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.11  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective charter or bylaws or other 



 

70  organization documents or in any agreement to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, which rights shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by Law. For a
period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain in effect the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the Companys and any Company
Subsidiarys charter and bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as
of the date hereof or in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its
Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers or employees
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or
asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. Parent shall assume,
be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand surety for,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in
accordance with their respective terms, each of the covenants contained in
this _Section 5.11_ without limit as to time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if
such service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses
(including advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by law), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (
_provided_ that any Action may only be settled with the prior written consent
of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld) in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission occurring or alleged
to have occurred before or at the Effective Time (including acts or omissions
in connection with such persons serving as an officer, director or other
fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit
of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any
such Action.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the Closing Date maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with
respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time either through the
Companys existing insurance provider or another provider reasonably selected
by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Effective Time, Parent
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in 



 

71  such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount; provided further, however, that in lieu of the foregoing insurance
coverage, Parent may direct the Company to purchase "tail" insurance
coverage, at a cost no greater than the aggregate amount which the Surviving
Corporation would be permitted to spend during the six-year period provided
for in this _Section 5.11(c)_, that provides coverage no materially less
favorable than the coverage described above.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.11_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the articles of restatement or bylaws or other organization documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any other
indemnification arrangement, the MGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this 
_Section 5.11_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are
intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_.

Section 5.12  _Integration Committee_. Parent and the Company shall create a
transition team and transition steering committee comprised of adequate
management and senior executives, respectively, from both Parent and the
Company to examine various alternatives regarding the manner in which to best
integrate the businesses of the Company and Parent after the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law.

Section 5.13 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 5.14 _Certain Transfer Taxes_. Any liability arising out of any real
estate transfer Tax with respect to interests in real property owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Merger, if applicable and due with respect to the Merger, shall be borne
by the Surviving Corporation and expressly shall not be a direct liability of
stockholders of the Company.

Section 5.15 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions 



 

72  of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Parent Common Stock) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.16 _Tax Matters_.

(a) Each party shall cooperate with the other parties, and use its reasonable
best efforts, to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "),
including (i) reasonably refraining from any action that such party knows is
reasonably likely to prevent the Intended Tax Treatment, (ii) executing such
amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in order to obtain
the Intended Tax Treatment (it being understood that no party will be required
to agree to any such amendment that it determines in good faith is reasonably
likely to materially adversely affect the value of the Merger to such party
or its stockholders), and (iii) using its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the opinions referred to in _Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.3(e)_, including
by executing customary letters of representation.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent
shall deliver to the Company a copy of the proposed form of the Parent Tax
Opinion together with all letters or certificates that form the basis therefor
(collectively, the " _Parent Tax Opinion Materials_ "). The Company shall be
entitled to a reasonable amount of time to provide Parent with written
comments on the Parent Tax Opinion Materials. Parent shall furnish the Company
with a copy of the final Parent Tax Opinion Materials.

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of the proposed form of the Company Tax
Opinion together with all letters or certificates that form the basis
therefor (collectively, the " _Company Tax Opinion Materials_ "). Parent shall
be entitled to a reasonable amount of time to provide the Company with written
comments on the Company Tax Opinion Materials. The Company shall furnish
Parent with a copy of the final Company Tax Opinion Materials.

Section 5.17 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger
Consideration to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official notice of
issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.18 _Charitable Contributions_. During the three-year period
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, directly or
indirectly, community development and charitable contributions within the
service areas of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that are utilities
at levels consistent with the levels of community development and
charitable contributions historically provided by the Company and its
Subsidiaries and thereafter at levels consistent with those provided by Parent

to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys material breach of
any material provision of this Agreement or failure to use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions, as required by
and subject to _Section 5.8_.

ARTICLE VII

material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

_Section 6.2_ and (ii) cannot be cured by the End Date, _provided_ , that the
Company shall have given Parent written notice, delivered at least 30 days
prior to such termination (but no later than the expected Closing Date),

respective Representatives or affiliates shall have breached in any material

notify any other party of any changes to the address or any of the other

notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice or
five business days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection or

Section 8.8 _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule
or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (i) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the relevant party that
are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (ii) any
other representations and warranties of such party that is contained in this
Agreement (regardless of the absence of an express reference or cross-
reference in a particular Section of this Agreement or a particular Section
of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or Parent Disclosure Schedule), but
only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or a disclosure
for purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably
apparent.

Section 8.9 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, except
for assignments by Merger Sub to a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary
of Parent. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.

  

 

84 Section 8.10 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which
is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any
provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

Section 8.11 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto) and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and, except
for the provisions of _Section 5.11_, is not intended to and shall not
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

Section 8.12  _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub or, in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_ , _however_ , that
after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval, if any such amendment or waiver
shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of
the NYSE require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, the
effectiveness of such amendment or waiver shall be subject to the approval of
the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by the Company or Parent in exercising any right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude
any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
