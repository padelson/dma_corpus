</FONT>As of the date of this Agreement, SPAC has an amount in cash in the Trust Account equal to at least $150,000,000.&nbsp;
The funds held in the Trust Account are (a) invested in United States &ldquo;government securities&rdquo; within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations
and (b) held in trust pursuant to that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2020 (the &ldquo;<U>Trust
Agreement</U>&rdquo;), between SPAC and Continental, as trustee (the &ldquo;<U>Trustee</U>&rdquo;). There are no separate agreements,
side letters or other agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description
of the Trust Agreement in the SPAC SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect or, to SPAC&rsquo;s knowledge, that would
entitle any Person to any portion of the funds in the Trust Account (other than (i) in respect of deferred underwriting commissions
or Taxes, (ii) the SPAC Stockholders who shall have elected to redeem their SPAC Shares pursuant to the Governing Documents of
SPAC or (iii) if SPAC fails to complete a business combination within the allotted time period set forth in the Governing Documents
of SPAC and liquidates the Trust Account, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement, SPAC (in limited amounts to permit SPAC
to pay the expenses of the Trust Account&rsquo;s liquidation, dissolution and winding up of SPAC) and then the SPAC Stockholders).&nbsp;
Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account are permitted to be released, except in the circumstances described
in the Governing Documents of SPAC and the Trust Agreement. SPAC has performed all material obligations required to be performed
by it to date under, and is not in material default, breach or delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual)
in connection with the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred which, with due notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute
such a default or breach thereunder. There are no claims or Proceedings pending with respect to the Trust Account. Since April
30, 2020, SPAC has not released any money from the Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the funds held in the Trust
Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). Upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the distribution
of assets from the Trust Account (A) in respect of deferred underwriting commissions or Taxes or (B) to the SPAC Stockholders who
have elected to redeem their SPAC Shares pursuant to the Governing Documents of SPAC, each in accordance with the terms of and
as set forth in the Trust Agreement, SPAC shall have no further obligation under either the Trust Agreement or the Governing Documents
of SPAC to liquidate or distribute any assets held in the Trust Account, and the Trust Agreement shall terminate in accordance
with its terms.</P>

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, Perception and Antara, and the exercise
by a Party, Perception or Antara of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.&nbsp; The Parties,
Perception and Antara agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties, Perception or Antara do not perform their obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The Parties, Perception and Antara acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Parties, Perception and Antara shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or other
equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and
thereof, without proof of damages and without posting a bond, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance
with <U>Section 7.1</U>, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (ii)
the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that
right, none of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party, Perception and Antara agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties, Perception or
Antara have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity. The Parties, Perception and Antara acknowledge and agree that any Party, Perception or Antara seeking an
injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with this <U>Section 8.17</U> shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such injunction.</P>

established a trust account (the &ldquo;<U>Trust Account</U>&rdquo;) containing the proceeds of its initial public offering
(the &ldquo;<U>IPO</U>&rdquo;) and from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of SPAC&rsquo;s public shareholders (including overallotment shares
acquired by SPAC&rsquo;s underwriters, the &ldquo;<U>Public Shareholders</U>&rdquo;), and SPAC may disburse monies from the

entering into this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Company Parties each hereby agree on behalf of itself and its Representatives and controlled Affiliates

or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between SPAC or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and, the Company Party or any of its Representatives or controlled Affiliates, on the other
hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of
legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the &ldquo;<U>Trust Account Released
Claims</U>&rdquo;).&nbsp; Each Company Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives and controlled
Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives any Trust Account Released Claims that it or any of its Representatives or controlled

arising out of, any negotiations, or Contracts with SPAC or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
