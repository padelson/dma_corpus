Company Change of Control Transaction.

  



  

Section 2.4   _No Fractional Company Ordinary Shares._ No certificates for
Company Ordinary Shares representing fractional Company Ordinary Shares or

Shares or Sponsor Shares, or the issuance of Perception Company Ordinary
Shares or Management Shares, or the issuance of Earnout Shares (if issuable
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ ) in accordance with _Section 2.2_ and _Section
2.3_ , and such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to
vote or to have any rights as a holder of any Company Ordinary Shares.

any fraction of a Company Ordinary Share, all fractions of Company Ordinary
Shares that otherwise would be issued hereunder shall be aggregated and the

of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of 185
days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule

certain Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of April 30, 2020 (the
" _Trust Agreement_ "), between SPAC and Continental, as trustee (the "
_Trustee_ "). There are no separate agreements, side letters or other
agreements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or
implied) that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in the SPAC
SEC Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect or, to SPAC's knowledge,
that would entitle any Person to any portion of the funds in the Trust
Account (other than (i) in respect of deferred underwriting commissions or
Taxes, (ii) the SPAC Stockholders who shall have elected to redeem their SPAC
Shares pursuant to the Governing Documents of SPAC or (iii) if SPAC fails to
complete a business combination within the allotted time period set forth in
the Governing Documents of SPAC and liquidates the Trust Account, subject to
the terms of the Trust Agreement, SPAC (in limited amounts to permit SPAC to
pay the expenses of the Trust Account's liquidation, dissolution and winding
up of SPAC) and then the SPAC Stockholders).  Prior to the Closing, none of
the funds held in the Trust Account are permitted to be released, except in
the circumstances described in the Governing Documents of SPAC and the Trust
Agreement. SPAC has performed all material obligations required to be
performed by it to date under, and is not in material default, breach or
delinquent in performance or any other respect (claimed or actual) in
connection with the Trust Agreement, and no event has occurred which, with due
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute such a default or breach
thereunder. There are no claims or Proceedings pending with respect to the
Trust Account. Since April 30, 2020, SPAC has not released any money from the
Trust Account (other than interest income earned on the funds held in the
Trust Account as permitted by the Trust Agreement). Upon the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the distribution of assets
from the Trust Account (A) in respect of deferred underwriting commissions or
Taxes or (B) to the SPAC Stockholders who have elected to redeem their SPAC
Shares pursuant to the Governing Documents of SPAC, each in accordance with
the terms of and as set forth in the Trust Agreement, SPAC shall have no
further obligation under either the Trust Agreement or the Governing
Documents of SPAC to liquidate or distribute any assets held in the Trust
Account, and the Trust Agreement shall terminate in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the
Company contained herein and the compliance by the Company with its
respective obligations hereunder, SPAC has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the use of funds in the Trust Account will not be satisfied
or funds available in the Trust Account will not be available to SPAC on the
Closing Date (after disbursements in respect of deferred underwriting
commissions, Taxes, and to the SPAC Stockholders who shall have elected to
redeem their SPAC Shares pursuant to the Governing Documents of SPAC).

any Company Party), a reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any
proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity relating to
the Transactions. Each of the Parties agrees not to participate in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it consults with, in the case of any Company Party, SPAC,
or, in the case of SPAC, any Company Party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives, in the case of any Company
Party, SPAC, or, in the case of SPAC, the Company, the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, in the event
that this _Section 5.2_ conflicts with any other covenant or agreement in
this _Article V_ that is intended to specifically address any subject matter,
then such other covenant or agreement shall govern and control solely to the
extent of such conflict.

  



  

(d) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, SPAC,
on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall each notify the
other in writing promptly after learning of any shareholder demands or other
shareholder Proceedings (including derivative claims) relating to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Document or any matters relating thereto
(collectively, the " _Transaction Litigation_ ") commenced against, in the

Representative of SPAC) or, in the case of the Company and Merger Sub, any
Group Company or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives (in
their capacity as a Representative of any Group Company or Merger Sub). SPAC
and the Company shall each (i) keep the other reasonably informed regarding
any Transaction Litigation, (ii) give the other the opportunity to, at its own

and settlement of any such Transaction Litigation; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the Company, any other Group Company, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Representatives settle or compromise any Transaction
Litigation without the prior written consent of SPAC (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed,  _provided_ that it shall be deemed to be

settlement or compromise (A) does not provide for a legally binding, full,
unconditional and irrevocable release of SPAC and its Representative(s) that
are the subject of such Transaction Litigation, (B) provides for (x) the
payment of cash any portion of which is payable by SPAC or its
Representative(s) thereof or would otherwise constitute a SPAC Liability or

its Representatives any information (i) if and to the extent doing so would

privacy Law, (B) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third-
parties in breach of any Contract with such third-party, (C) violate any
legally binding obligation of any Group Company with respect to
confidentiality, non-disclosure or privacy or (D) jeopardize protections
afforded to any Group Company under the attorney-client privilege or the

(A)_ through  _(D)_ , the Company shall, and shall cause the other Group
Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) provide such access
as can be provided (or otherwise convey such information regarding the
applicable matter as can be conveyed) without violating such privilege,

so would (A) violate any Law to which SPAC is subject, (B) result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third-parties in breach of any Contract

provide such information in a manner without violating such privilege,
doctrine, Contract, obligation or Law), or (ii) if SPAC, on the one hand, and
any Group Company, any Company Non-Party Affiliate, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Representatives, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_

Proposal; _provided_ , that this _clause (i)_ shall not be deemed to permit
the Company or the Company Board to effect a Company Change in Recommendation
except in accordance with _Section 5.6(c)_ ;

  



  

(ii)  prior to obtaining the Company Preferred Shareholder Approval and the
Company Shareholder Approval, making a Company Change in Recommendation (only
to the extent permitted by _Section 5.6(c)_ ); or

  



  

(iii)  resolving, authorizing, committing or agreeing to take any of the
foregoing actions, only to the extent such actions would be permitted by the
foregoing _clauses (i)_ through _(ii)_.

  



  

   

74

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.6_ or _Section 5.13_ to the
contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Preferred
Shareholder Approval and the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board
determines in good faith, in response to an Intervening Event, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make a
Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, the Company or the Company Board may, prior to
obtaining the Company Preferred Shareholder Approval and the Company
Shareholder Approval, make a Company Change in Recommendation; _provided_ ,
that the Company will not be entitled to make, or agree or resolve to make, a
Company Change in Recommendation unless (i) the Company delivers to SPAC a
written notice (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising SPAC that the
Company Board proposes to take such action and containing the material facts
underlying the Company Board's determination that an Intervening Event has
occurred, and (ii) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the fifth
(5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Intervening Event Notice (such period from the time the
Intervening Event Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
fifth (5th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company
delivered the Intervening Event Notice (it being understood that any material
development with respect to an Intervening Event shall require a new notice
with an additional four (4) Business Day (instead of five (5) Business Day)
period from the date of such notice), the " _Intervening Event Notice Period_
"), the Company Board, after considering in good faith any proposed
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement proposed by SPAC so
as to obviate the need for a Company Change in Recommendation, reaffirms in
good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make a Company Change in Recommendation would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. During the Intervening Event
Notice Period, (x) the Company shall not make a Company Change in
Recommendation, and (y) the Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its Representatives to, engage in good faith negotiations
with SPAC and its Representatives to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so as to obviate the need for a Company Change
in Recommendation. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company
be permitted to accept a Company Acquisition Proposal, or take any action
prohibited by _Section 5.6(c)_ in connection therewith, or make a Company
Change in Recommendation in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(d) If the Company makes a Company Change in Recommendation in accordance
with _Section 5.6(c)_ , the Company shall terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Article VII and concurrently therewith pay a termination fee
to SPAC in an amount equal to $14.625 million (" _Termination Fee_ ") in
immediately available funds as liquidated damages and not as a penalty.

or seek to do any of the foregoing. SPAC agrees to (A) notify the Company

describe the material terms and conditions of any such SPAC Acquisition
Proposal in reasonable detail (including the identity of any Person making
such SPAC Acquisition Proposal) and (B) keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis of any modifications to such offer or
information. The transfer of the SPAC Evaluation Material pursuant to

provided in the SPAC Governing Documents or other applicable agreements as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. The indemnification and
liability limitation or exculpation provisions of the SPAC Governing

provide coverage on terms (with respect to coverage and amount) that are
substantially the same as (and no less favorable in the aggregate to the
insured than) the coverage provided under SPAC's directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies as of the date of this Agreement and shall be
obtained from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the current insurance carrier(s) of SPAC and the Company with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance; _provided_ that the Surviving
Company shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums in excess of three
hundred percent (300%) of the most recent annual premium paid by SPAC prior to

5.14_.

  



  

(e) The DandO Persons entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 5.14_ are intended to
be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.14_. This _Section 5.14_
shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Surviving Company.

(A) will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto), (B) will fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows of the Group Companies as of

Antara, as applicable. Upon such determination that any term or other

Section 8.13 _No Recourse_. Except for claims pursuant to any Ancillary

part of any such Party, Perception or Antara to any such extension or waiver

not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver
of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition of
this Agreement. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

Section 8.15 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES, PERCEPTION AND ANTARA EACH
HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY

CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES,
PERCEPTION AND ANTARA IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO OR ANY FINANCING IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY OF THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR

PARTIES, PERCEPTION AND ANTARA EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH
PROCEEDING, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY
COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES, PERCEPTION AND ANTARA MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS
WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY, PERCEPTION AND ANTARA CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN

Section 8.16 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties, Perception
and Antara irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction,
any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, State of New
York, New York County), for the purposes of any Proceeding, claim, demand,
action or cause of action (a) arising under this Agreement or under
any Ancillary Document or (b) in any way connected with or related or
incidental to the dealings of the Parties, Perception and Antara in respect
of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of the Transactions, and
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any such Proceeding in any such court, and further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such Proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each
Party, Perception and Antara hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any Proceeding claim, demand, action or cause of action against
such Party (i) arising under this Agreement or under any Ancillary Document or
(ii) in any way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of
the Parties in respect of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or any of
the Transactions, (A) any claim that such Party is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the courts as described in this _Section 8.16_ for any
reason, (B) that such Party or such Party's property is exempt or immune from
the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (C) that (x) the Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of
action in any such court is brought against such Party in an inconvenient
forum, (y) the venue of such Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of
action against such Party is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced against such Party in or by such courts.
Each Party, Perception and Antara agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by registered mail to such party's respective address set

Proceeding, claim, demand, action or cause of action.

Section 8.17 _Remedies_.  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and
not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such Party, Perception and Antara, and the exercise by a Party, Perception or
Antara of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
The Parties, Perception and Antara agree that irreparable damage for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that the Parties, Perception or Antara do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement)
in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
The Parties, Perception and Antara acknowledge and agree that (i) the
Parties, Perception and Antara shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance, or other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and thereof,
without proof of damages and without posting a bond, prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.1_ , this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none
of the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party, Perception
and Antara agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other Parties,
Perception or Antara have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. The Parties, Perception and Antara acknowledge and agree that any
Party, Perception or Antara seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 8.17_ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such injunction.

  



  

Section 8.18 _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final
prospectus of SPAC, filed with the SEC (File No. 333-236798) on May 1, 2020
(the " _SPAC Prospectus_ "). The Company acknowledges and agrees and
understands that SPAC has established a trust account (the " _Trust Account_
") containing the proceeds of its initial public offering (the " _IPO_ ") and
from certain private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO
(including interest accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of
SPAC's public shareholders (including overallotment shares acquired by SPAC's
underwriters, the " _Public Shareholders_ "), and SPAC may disburse monies
from the Trust Account only in the express circumstances described in the
SPAC Prospectus. For and in consideration of SPAC entering into this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company Parties each hereby
agree on behalf of itself and its Representatives and controlled
Affiliates that, notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of the Company Parties nor any of its or their
Representatives or controlled Affiliates does now or shall at any time
hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any
monies in the Trust Account or distributions therefrom, or make any claim
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom), regardless
of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating
in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship
between SPAC or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and, the Company
Party or any of its Representatives or controlled Affiliates, on the
other hand, or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises
based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (any
and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as the " _Trust
Account Released Claims_ "). Each Company Party, on its own behalf and on
behalf of its Representatives and controlled Affiliates, hereby irrevocably
waives any Trust Account Released Claims that it or any of its Representatives
or controlled Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations, or Contracts with SPAC or its Representatives and will
not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any distributions
therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged breach of any
agreement with SPAC or its Affiliates).

Section 8.19 _Conflicts; Privilege_.

  



  

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree, on their own behalf and on
behalf of their respective directors, members, shareholders,
stockholders, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, as applicable,
that:

  



  

(i) Graubard Miller, Cassels Brock and Blackwell LLP, and Goldfarb Seligman and
Co. (the " _Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms_ ") have acted as counsel to SPAC and
the holders of SPAC Common Stock (individually and collectively, the " _SPAC
Group_ "), in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company
Parties agree, and shall cause the Group Companies to agree, that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, such representation and
any prior representation of SPAC by the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms, or any
successors thereto, shall not preclude the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms from
serving as counsel to the SPAC Group or any director, member, shareholder,
stockholder, partner, officer or employee of the SPAC Group, in connection
with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company Parties shall
not, and each shall cause the Group Companies not to, seek to or have the Pre-
Closing SPAC Law Firms disqualified from any such representation based upon
the prior representation of SPAC by the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms. The
parties hereto hereby consent thereto and waive any potential conflict of
interest arising from such prior representation, and each of such parties
shall cause any of their respective Affiliates to consent to waive any
potential conflict of interest arising from such representation. Each of the
parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has
been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with counsel
or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.

  



  

(ii) Latham and Watkins LLP and Meitar | Law Offices (" _Pre-Closing Company
Law Firms_ ") has acted as counsel to the Company Parties and the Group
Companies (individually and collectively, the " _Company Group_ "), in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the applicable Ancillary Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. SPAC agrees that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, such representation and
any prior representation of the Company Group by the Pre-Closing Company Law
Firms shall not preclude the Pre-Closing Company Law Firms from serving as
counsel to the Company Group or any director, member, shareholder, partner,
officer or employee of the Company Group, in connection with any litigation,
claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. SPAC shall not seek or have the Pre-Closing
Company Law Firms disqualified from any such representation based upon the
prior representation of the Company Group by the Pre-Closing Company Law
Firms. Each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any
potential conflict of interest arising from such prior representation, and
each of such parties shall cause any of its Affiliates to consent to waive
any potential conflict of interest arising from such representation. Each of
the parties acknowledges that such consent and waiver is voluntary, that it
has been carefully considered, and that the parties have consulted with
counsel or have been advised they should do so in connection herewith.

  



  

(iii) The covenants, consents and waivers contained in this _Section 8.19_
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which the Pre-Closing
SPAC Law Firms or the Pre-Closing Company Law Firms are entitled whether
pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

  



  

   

99

 



    



  

(b) All communications between the SPAC Group, on the one hand, and Pre-
Closing SPAC Law Firms, on the other hand, relating to the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _SPAC Privileged
Communications_ ") and all communications between the Company Group, on the
one hand, and Pre-Closing Company Law Firms, on the other hand, relating to
the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company
Privileged Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be attorney-
client privileged and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto
shall belong solely to the SPAC Group and the Company Group, as applicable,
and shall not pass to or be claimed by Company, Merger Sub, or any Group
Company (in the case of SPAC Privilege Communication) or the SPAC (in the
case of Company Privileged Communication). Accordingly, Company, Merger Sub,
and the Group Companies shall not have access to any SPAC Privileged
Communications or to the files of the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms and SPAC
shall not have access to the Company Privileged Communications or to the
files of the Pre-Closing Company Law Firms relating to the engagement of the
Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms by the SPAC Group and the Pre-Closing Company Law
Firms by the Company Group, as applicable, from and after Closing.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after the
Closing, (i) (A) the SPAC Group (and not the Company, Merger Sub, or any
Group Company) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with
respect to the engagement of the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms, and none of
Company, Merger Sub, or any Group Company shall be a holder thereof and (B)
the Company Group (and not SPAC) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-
client privilege with respect to the engagement of the Pre-Closing
Company Law Firms, and SPAC shall not be a holder thereof, (ii) (A) to the
extent that files of the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms in respect of their
engagement by the SPAC Group constitute property of the client, only the SPAC
Group (and not the Company, Merger Sub, nor any Group Company) shall hold
such property rights and (B) to the extent that files of Pre-Closing Company
Law Firms in respect of its engagement by the Company Group constitute
property of the client, only the Company Group (and not SPAC) shall hold
such property rights and (iii) (A) the Pre-Closing SPAC Law Firms shall have
no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-
client communications or files to the Company, Merger Sub, or any Group
Company by reason of any attorney-client relationship between the Pre-Closing
SPAC Law Firms and SPAC or otherwise and (B) the Pre-Closing Company Law Firms
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to SPAC by reason of any attorney-client relationship
between the Pre-Closing Company Law Firms and the Group Companies or
otherwise.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
SPAC or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party other than any of
the Company Group, on the other hand, SPAC and its Affiliates may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications to such third party; _provided, however_ , that neither SPAC
nor any of its Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. In the event that SPAC or any of its Affiliates is
legally required by order of a Governmental Entity or otherwise legally
required to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of the Company
Privileged Communications, to the extent (x) permitted by applicable Law, and
(y) advisable in the opinion of SPAC's counsel, then SPAC shall immediately
(and, in any event, within five (5) Business Days) notify the Company in
writing so that the Company can seek a protective order.

  



  

(e) This _Section 8.19 _is intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the SPAC Group and the Company Group. This _Section 8.19_
shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 8.19_ may be amended,
waived or modified, without the prior written consent of the Pre-Closing SPAC
Law Firms or Pre-Closing Company Law Firms, as applicable.
