agreement thereunder, on condition that at such time such holder continues to
be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any (direct or indirect)
Subsidiary of Parent; _provided, however_ , that any holder of Non-Cashed-

that was a Non-Cashed-Out Option that is unvested, unexpired and outstanding
immediately prior to such dismissal or resignation, such amount as soon as
administratively practicable following such dismissal or resignation;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, so long as a holder of an unvested,

evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

(e) **_Adjustments to Merger Consideration_**. The Merger Consideration shall
be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,

rights to appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law and (iii)
as of the Effective Time has not effectively withdrawn or lost such holders
appraisal rights (collectively, the " **Dissenting Shares** "), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration set
forth in **Section 1.6(a)** , but the holder thereof shall only be entitled
to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of **Section 1.7(a)** , if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law,
then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event,
such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares.

  

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal, withdrawals of such demands and any other related instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law received by the Company pursuant to the

(c) **_Exchange Procedures_**.  Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent

transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall otherwise be in customary form)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for the consideration for Company Common Stock or Cashed-Out

required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of record of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefore the cash constituting the
consideration for Company Common Stock or Cashed-Out Options, as applicable,
set forth in **Section 1.6** , and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be
deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to
evidence the right to receive the consideration for Company Common Stock or
Cashed-Out Options, as applicable, set forth in **Section 1.6**.

  

(d) **_Required Withholding_**.  Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Certificates such amounts as may be required to be deducted
or withheld therefrom under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " **Code** "), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law
or under any other applicable Legal Requirement. To the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

  

(e) **_No Liability_**.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
**Section 1.8** , neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Certificates for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.

     

   

(f) **_Investment of Exchange Fund._**  The Exchange Agent shall invest the
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect
the amounts payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to this **Section
1.8**. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall
become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to this **Section 1.8**  shall
promptly be paid to Parent.

  

(g) **_Termination of Exchange Fund_**.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six months after
the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation to be held in trust for such holders
or otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and
any holders of Certificates who have not surrendered such Certificates in
compliance with this **Section 1.8**  shall after such delivery to the
Surviving Corporation, subject to **Section 1.8(d)** , look only to the
Surviving Corporation solely as general creditors for the cash constituting
the Merger Consideration (which shall not accrue interest) pursuant to
**Section 1.6**  with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

  

1.9 **_No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Cashed-Out
Options._** All consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Common
Stock or Cashed-Out Options, as the case may be, or by applicable law, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
the Surviving Corporation of Company Common Stock or Cashed-Out Options,
which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
**Article I**.

  

1.10 **_Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._** In the event any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such
cash constituting the consideration for Company Common Stock or Cashed-Out
Options, as applicable, as set forth in **Section 1.6** ; _provided, however_
, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Company or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

1.11 **_Further Action._** At and after the Effective Time, the officers and

the SEC, and will provide Parent with a copy of all such filings made
with the SEC. The Company shall also promptly provide Parent with copies of
any correspondence received from the SEC, and shall permit representatives of
Parent to participate in any telephone call with the SEC which discusses
comments made by the staff. Subject to **Section 5.3(d)** , the Company will
cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the definitive Proxy Statement is filed with the
SEC.

  

5.2 **_Meeting of Company Stockholders; Board Recommendation._**

  

The Company will take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law
and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to call, hold and convene a
meeting of its stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting to consider
adoption of this Agreement (the " **Stockholders  Meeting**") to be held as
soon as reasonably practicable after the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Companys stockholders. Subject to **this ** Section 5.2 **and Section
5.3(d)** , the Company will use all commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq
Global Market or Delaware Law or any other applicable Legal Requirements to
obtain such approvals. The Company shall ensure that the Stockholders
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted in compliance with,
and that all proxies solicited by it in connection with the Stockholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with Delaware Law,

     

   

its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the rules of the Nasdaq Global
Market and all other applicable Legal Requirements. Except to the extent
expressly permitted by this **Section 5.2** or **Section 5.3(d)** : (i) all
directors present and voting at a duly called and held meeting of the Board
of Directors of the Company shall recommend that its stockholders vote in
favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the
Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the directors
present and voting at a duly called and held meeting of the Board of
Directors of the Company have, by resolution adopted by all directors present
and voting at a duly called and held meeting, recommended that the Companys
stockholders vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement at the Stockholders
Meeting and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, such recommendation
of the Board of Directors that the Companys stockholders vote in favor of
adoption of this Agreement.  Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to the first
sentence of this **Section 5.2** shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Board of Directors of the Company from failing to make or from withdrawing or
modifying its recommendation to the Companys stockholders, provided that the
Board of Directors determines in good faith and after consultation with its
outside legal advisors that such action is necessary for the Board of
Directors to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company or the Companys
stockholders under applicable law, but only after (i) providing written
notice to Parent that it is prepared to make the determination permitted by
this **Section 5.2** and setting forth the reasons therefore and (ii) for a
period of five Business Days after providing such notice the Company
negotiates with Parent in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable its Board of Directors to
proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement, and at the end of such
period the Board of Directors maintains its determination permitted by this
**Section 5.2**  (after taking into account the proposed adjustments).
Notwithstanding any Change of Recommendation, this Agreement and the Merger
shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Stockholders
Meeting for the purpose of obtaining the stockholders vote on the Agreement
and the Merger.

  

5.3 **_Acquisition Proposals._**

  

(a) **_No Solicitation_**. The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its Subsidiaries to, nor shall the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of their respective officers, directors,
agents or representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or
accountant retained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) to, directly
or indirectly: (i) solicit or initiate or knowingly encourage, facilitate or
induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making, submission or announcement
of, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any nonpublic information
with respect to, or take any other action to knowingly encourage or

would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
approve, endorse, recommend or make or authorize any statement,

any Acquisition Proposal or transaction contemplated

expressly permitted by **Sections 5.3(c)** or **(d)**. The Company and its
Subsidiaries will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations (including, without
limitation, any such activities, discussions or negotiations conducted by
affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(including any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) with any
third parties conducted heretofore with respect to consideration of any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company will exercise any rights under any
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements with any such third parties
to require the return or destruction of non-public information provided prior
to the date of this Agreement by the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
agents and representatives to any such third parties.

  

(b) **_Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals._** As promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or from any
Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the Company relating
to a possible Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with
notice of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, including
the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry; the identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry; and a copy of all written materials provided by
or on behalf of such Person or group in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall provide Parent with 24 hours
prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as is provided to the members of
its Board of Directors) of any meeting of its Board of Directors at which its
Board of Directors would reasonably be expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal or any such inquiry or to consider providing nonpublic information
to any Person. The Company shall notify Parent, in writing, of any decision
of its Board of Directors as to whether to consider such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry or to enter into discussions or negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide nonpublic information or
data to any Person, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable
after such meeting (and in any event no later than 24 hours after such
determination was reached and 24 hours prior to entering into any discussions
or negotiations or providing any nonpublic information or data to any
Person).  The Company agrees that it shall promptly provide Parent with oral
and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably
necessary to keep Parent currently informed in all material respects of the
status and material terms (including material amendments or proposed material
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry (including
any negotiations contemplated by **Section 5.3(c)** ) and shall promptly
provide Parent a copy of all written materials subsequently provided to, by
or on behalf of such Person or group in connection with such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry.

  

(c) **_Superior Offers_**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in **Section 5.3(a)** , in the event that the Company receives prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company in accordance
with applicable law an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
from a third party that did not result from a breach of this **Section 5.3**
 and that the Companys Board of Directors has concluded that such
Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to be, a Superior Offer, the
Company may then (1) furnish nonpublic information to the third party (and
its representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and (2) engage in
discussions and negotiations (including exchanging draft agreements) with the
third party and its representatives with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that:

     

   

(i) the Company complies with all of the terms of this **Section 5.3** ;

  

(ii) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information or entering into any
negotiations or discussions with such third party, (1) the Company receives
from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing
customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and
oral information furnished to such third party on the Companys behalf on
terms no less restrictive to such third party than the Confidentiality
Agreement is with respect to Parent (or its affiliates), (2) such third party
enters into a standstill agreement on terms no less restrictive to such third
party than those of Section 2 of the Exclusivity and Standstill Agreement
dated October 17, 2006, as amended (the " **Exclusivity and Standstill
Agreement** "), between Parent and the Company; provided that, in the event
such third party does not enter into such a standstill agreement, Section 2
of the Exclusivity and Standstill Agreement shall terminate and be of no
further force and effect, and (3) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such third party, the Company furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously so furnished); and

  

(iii) the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to
provide such information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Board of Directors
fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law.

  

(d) **_Change of Recommendation_**. Subject to the provisions of **Section
5.2** and **Section 5.3** , in response to the receipt of a Superior
Offer, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify its recommendation in favor of the Merger, and, in the case
of a Superior Offer that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to
the stockholders of the Company, may recommend that the stockholders of the
Company accept the tender or exchange offer (any of the foregoing actions,
whether by the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee thereof, a "
**Change of Recommendation** "), (y) the Board of Directors of the Company,
the Company or its Subsidiaries (including each of their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives) may approve,
endorse, or recommend any Superior Offer, or (z) the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may execute or enter into or propose to execute or enter into
any letter of intent or similar document or any contract, agreement or
commitment (which may be conditioned on the termination of this Agreement)
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Superior Offer or transaction
contemplated thereby, if all of the following conditions in clauses (i)
through (vii) are met:

  

(i) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that a Superior Offer has been made and not withdrawn;

  

(ii) the stockholders of the Company have not approved this Agreement in
accordance with applicable law;

  

(iii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent written notice (a "
**Change of Recommendation Notice** ") at least five Business Days prior
to publicly effecting such Change of Recommendation which shall state
expressly (A) that the Company has received a Superior Offer, (B) the final
terms and conditions of the Superior Offer and the

     

   

identity of the Person or group making the Superior Offer and (C) that the
Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation;

  

(iv) after delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, the Company shall
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement during such five-Business Day period,
and negotiate in good faith with respect thereto during such five-Business
Day period, as would enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation to
stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement without making a Change
of Recommendation;

  

(v) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined (A) after
consultation with its financial advisor, that the terms of the Superior Offer
are more favorable to the stockholders of the Company than the terms of the
Merger (as it may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (iv) above) and (B) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, the failure to effect a Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the
Board of Directors fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable law;

  

(vi) the Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth in
**Section 5.2** or this **Section 5.3** ; and

the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof.

  

(e) The Company agrees that, in the event of a Change in Recommendation, it
shall mail the Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company prior to
mailing any proxy materials relating to any Superior Offer to the
stockholders of the Company.

  

(i) **_Compliance with Disclosure Obligations_**. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from complying
with Rules 14-a-9, 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or
prohibit or restrict the Company or its Board of Directors from making other
disclosures required by federal securities laws, applicable rules or
applicable Nasdaq rules.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall
not effect a Change of Recommendation unless specifically permitted pursuant
to the terms of **Section 5.3(d)**.

  

(f) **_State Takeover Statute._** The Board of Directors of the Company
shall not, in connection with any Change of Recommendation, take any action
to change the approval of the Board of Directors of the Company for purposes
of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, this
**Section 5.3(f)**  shall not prohibit the Company from effecting a Change of
Recommendation under the circumstances and subject to the conditions set
forth in this **Section 5.3**.

into account, among other things, (X) all other legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the offer and (Y) the business, legal and financial

irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of this
**Section 5.3** were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or

specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United
States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth above by any officer, director, agent or representative of the Company
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

  

5.4 **_Confidentiality; Access to Information; No Modification of
Representations, Warranties or Covenants_**

  

(a) **_Confidentiality._** The parties acknowledge that the Company and

 No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation or notification
pursuant to this **Section 5.4** ,  **Section 5.6** , **Section 5.7** or

Action of Divestiture would not have a material consequence on Parent or
the Company. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, take or agree to take any Action of Divestiture that would be
reasonably likely to have a material consequence on Parent or the Company.

(a) **_By the Company_**. The Company shall give notice to Parent and Merger

in **Section 6.2(a)** would not be satisfied, (ii) the Company has failed to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement such that the
condition set forth in **Section 6.2(b)** would not be satisfied, or (iii) an

to cause the failure of any conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under **Section 6.2** ; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the Company or
the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement;
provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this **Section

condition set forth in **Section 6.3(a)** would not be satisfied, (ii) any
failure of Parent to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in **Section 6.3(b)**  would not
be satisfied or (iii) an occurrence or non-occurrence of any event which
could reasonably be expected to cause the failure of any conditions to the
obligations of the Company under **Section 6.3** ; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such notification shall affect the representations or warranties of

5.8 **_Indemnification._**

  

(a) **_Indemnity_**. With respect to claims made from and after the Effective
Time and during a period of at least six years thereafter, Parent will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects
the obligations of the Company to its current and former directors
and officers (the " **Indemnified Parties** ") pursuant to the
indemnification agreements between the Company and its current and former
directors and officers that are listed in **Section 5.8(a)** of the Company
Disclosure Letter (including, to the extent indemnifiable thereunder, for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) subject to
applicable law. The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation (or any successor to the Surviving Corporation) will contain
provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and the advancement
of expenses that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company as in effect
on the date hereof, which provisions will not, except as required by law,
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from
the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of Indemnified Parties; provided, however, that the foregoing
shall not apply if Parent assumes and honors any obligations to indemnify
such Persons for claims made during such six year period to the extent
provided in the Companys Second Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and the indemnification
agreements between the Company and its current and former officers and
directors as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and set forth in
**Section 5.8(a)** of the Company Disclosure Letter.

party insurers covering those Persons who are covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy as of the date hereof for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time of at least the same coverage
and amounts and containing other terms and conditions that are, in
the aggregate, no less favorable to the insured than those applicable to
the current directors and officers of the Company under policies maintained
by the Company; provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend in any one year in excess of 150% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage (and to the
extent annual premium would exceed 150% of the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such coverage, the Surviving Corporation shall use all

the Company:

  

(a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by a majority of the members of
the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company;

  

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have occurred by
March 31, 2007 (as it may be extended, the " **End Date** "), unless the
failure to consummate the Merger is the result of a material breach of
any agreement or covenant set forth in this Agreement or a material breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement by the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement; _provided_  that Parent may extend the
End Date, but no more than three times in the aggregate, and each time by one
month, but in no event beyond June 30, 2007, by providing written notice
thereof to the Company between three (3) and five (5) business days prior to
the next scheduled End Date if the Merger shall not have been consummated by
such date because the condition set forth under **Section 6.1(b)** or Section
6.2(d) shall not have been satisfied;

  

(c) by either the Company or Parent if a Governmental Entity shall have
issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the
failure to have taken an action), in any case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, which
order, decree, ruling or other action is final and nonappealable;

  

(d) by either the Company or Parent if the required approval of the
stockholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have

(e) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the
required vote of the stockholders of the Company) if a Triggering Event with

(f) by the Company, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

representation or warranty of Parent shall have become untrue, in either case
such that the conditions set forth in **Section 6.3(a)** or **Section
6.3(b)** would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as

     

   

of the time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if such inaccuracy in Parents representations
and warranties or breach by Parent is curable by Parent prior to the End Date
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company may
not terminate this Agreement under this **Section 7.1(f)** prior to 30 days
following the receipt of written notice from the Company to Parent of such
breach provided Parent continues to exercise all commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such breach through such 30-day period (it being understood
that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph
(f) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by
Parent is cured within such 30-day period);

  

(g) by Parent, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, in either
case such that the conditions set forth in **Section 6.2(a)**  or **Section
6.2(b)** would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the
time such representation or warranty shall have become untrue; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if such inaccuracy in the Companys representations and
warranties or breach by the Company is curable by the Company prior to the
End Date through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent

days following the receipt of written notice from Parent to the Company
of such breach provided the Company continues to exercise all
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach through such 30-day
period (it being understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this paragraph (g) if it shall have materially breached this
Agreement or if such breach by the Company is cured within such 30-day
period);

  

(h) by Parent if any Effect, either individually or in the aggregate, has
occurred since the date hereof that has or would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if such Effect is curable by the Company prior to the End Date through the
exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then Parent may not terminate
this Agreement under this **Section 7.1(h)** prior to 30 days following the
receipt of written notice from Parent to the Company of such Effect provided
the Company continues to exercise all commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such Effect through such 30-day period (it being understood that Parent may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (h) if it shall have
materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the Company is cured
within such 30-day period); and

agreement with respect to a Superior Offer pursuant to and in compliance with
**Section 5.3(d).**

  

For the purposes of this Agreement, a " **Triggering Event** ," with respect
to the Company, shall be deemed to have occurred if:  (i) its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof shall for any reason have withdrawn or
shall have amended or modified in a manner adverse to Parent its

entered into any letter of intent or similar document or any agreement,
contract or commitment accepting any Superior Offer, following notice of such
Superior Offer to Parent as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than 24 hours) after the Companys Board of Directors has determined,
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors that the failure to take such action with respect to the
Superior Offer would result in a breach of the Board of Directors fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law, and a
reasonable opportunity to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement during the five-Business Day period following such notice,
as would enable the Company to proceed with the Merger, (vi) a tender or
exchange offer relating to its securities shall have been commenced by
a Person unaffiliated with Parent, and the Company shall not have sent to

be amended by any further proposal submitted by Parent), effect the Merger,
each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii)
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach
of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the
obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their terms.

_however_ , in the case of termination pursuant to **Section 7.1(e)** ,
that payment of the Termination Fee by the Company shall be made within two
Business Days following termination and, _provided, further, however_ , that

(ii) **_Interest_** ; **_Other Remedies_**. The Company acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this **Section 7.3(b)**  are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the
Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to this
**Section 7.3(b)** , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent makes a

without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not be amended

8.8 **_Governing Law._** This Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and all disputes between the parties under or related to this
Agreement or the facts and circumstances leading to its execution, whether in
contract, tort or otherwise, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without reference to conflict of laws
principles. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with
any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the
matters contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in
any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such Persons
and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they

will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

  

8.10 **_Assignment._** No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties, except that Parent and Merger Sub may each
assign its respective rights and delegate its respective obligations
hereunder to any Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as long as Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be, remains ultimately liable for all of its
respective obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of
this  **Section 8.10** shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

8.11 **_Waiver of Jury Trial._**

  

EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL
