aggregate amount of the Estimated Transaction Consideration and each of the
Estimated Transaction Consideration Elements, and wire instructions for the

in the foregoing clause are collectively referred to herein as the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ ". The Estimated Closing Statement and Estimated
Net Working Capital shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the terms
of (including the definitions contained in) this Agreement, including
_Exhibit A_. Prior to the Closing, Seller, the Company and Buyer will work in
good faith to resolve any differences they may have with respect to any
information in the Estimated Closing Statement and any modifications to the
Estimated Transaction Consideration and the Estimated Transaction
Consideration Elements as may be proposed by the parties.

3.5 _Post-Closing Determination of Additional Transaction Consideration_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the determination of the Final
Closing Statement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit the Seller reasonable access to the
personnel, accountants and properties of the Company and the Companys
Subsidiaries, and provide reasonable access (with the right to make copies),
during business hours upon reasonable advance notice, to all of the books,
records, contracts and other documents (including auditors work papers) of
the Company 

 



-19-  and/or the Companys Subsidiaries that are or could reasonably be relevant
to the calculations set forth in the Closing Statement, a Dispute Notice or
otherwise reasonably related to the negotiation and/or resolution of the
Final Closing Statement; _provided_ that the auditors and accountants of Buyer
or its Affiliates (including the Company and/or the Companys Subsidiaries
following the Closing) shall not be obligated to make any work papers
available to Seller or its Representatives except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after Seller or its
Representatives, as the case may be, have signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Buyers and its Affiliates auditors and accountants.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare a good faith calculation of the
Final Transaction Consideration, the Final Transaction Consideration Elements
and the Additional Transaction Consideration (if any). The calculations
described under the foregoing clause are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Closing Statement_ ". Buyer shall deliver the Closing Statement,
together with reasonable supporting detail as to each of the calculations
(including with respect to the Final Transaction Consideration Elements) set
forth in the Closing Statement, to the Seller no later than ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date. If Buyer fails to timely deliver the Closing
Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence within such
ninety (90) day period, then, at the election of the Seller in its
sole discretion, either (x) the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by the
Company to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(a)_ shall be deemed to be the
Final Closing Statement for all purposes herein or (y) the Seller
shall retain (at the sole cost and expense of Buyer) a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm to analyze the Companys books, determine the
calculation of, and prepare, the Closing Statement consistent with the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 3.5_, the determination of such
accounting firm being conclusive, final and binding on the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
reserves any and all other rights granted to it in this Agreement. Buyer
shall promptly reimburse the Seller upon its request for all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Seller in connection with the foregoing clause (y).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that the
Closing Statement, and the component items and calculations therein, including
the Final Transaction Consideration Elements, shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the terms of (including the definitions contained in) this
Agreement, including _Exhibit A_. The Closing Statement shall be conclusive,
final and binding on all parties absent manifest error unless the Seller gives
Buyer written notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") of any disputes or objections
thereto (collectively, the " _Disputed Items_ ") with reasonable supporting
detail as to such Disputed Items, within forty five (45) days after receipt of
the Closing Statement (such period, the " _Review Period_ "). In the event
the Seller fails to give Buyer a Dispute Notice prior to the expiration of the
Review Period or otherwise earlier notifies Buyer in writing that the Seller
has no disputes or objections to the Closing Statement, the Final Transaction
Consideration, the Final Consideration Elements and the Additional Transaction
Consideration (if any) set forth in the Closing Statement shall be conclusive,
final and binding on the parties, and payments shall be made in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.5(f)_. In the event the Seller gives Buyer a Dispute
Notice prior to the expiration of the Review Period then, within two (2)
Business Days after such Dispute Notice has been given to Buyer, Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, shall pay to the other any undisputed amounts. By way
of example, (1) if the Final Transaction Consideration set forth in the
Closing Statement is higher than the Estimated Transaction Consideration,
Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of such difference and (2) if the Final
Transaction Consideration set forth in the Closing Statement is less than the
Estimated Transaction Consideration, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount
of such difference. 

 



-20- (c) Buyer and the Seller shall, for a period of thirty (30) days (or
such longer period as Buyer and the Seller may agree in writing) following
delivery of a Dispute Notice to Buyer (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt
in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to the Disputed Items
(all such discussions and communications related thereto shall (unless
otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Seller in writing) be governed by Rule 408
of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule), and
any such resolution by them as to any Disputed Items shall be conclusive,
final and binding on all parties absent manifest error. Any Disputed Items
agreed to by Buyer and the Seller in writing, together with any items or
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement not disputed or objected to
by the Seller in the Dispute Notice, are collectively referred to herein as
the " _Resolved Matters_ ". Any Resolved Matters shall be conclusive, final
and binding on all parties absent manifest error. If at the end of the
Resolution Period, Buyer and the Seller have been unable to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to all of the matters specified in
the Dispute Notice, either of Buyer or the Seller may, upon written notice to
the other, refer all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the
Dispute Notice (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ") for resolution to the
Independent Accountant. If one or more Unresolved Matters are submitted to the
Independent Accountant for resolution, Buyer and the Seller shall enter into
a customary and reasonable engagement letter with the Independent Accountant
at the time such dispute is submitted to the Independent Accountant and shall
cooperate with the Independent Accountant in connection with its
determination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_. Within ten (10) days
after the Independent Accountant has been retained, each of Buyer and the
Seller shall furnish, at its own expense, to the Independent Accountant and
substantially simultaneously to the other a written statement of its position
with respect to each Unresolved Matter. Within five (5) Business Days after
the expiration of such ten (10) day period, each of Buyer and the Seller may
deliver to the Independent Accountant its response to the others position on
each Unresolved Matter; _provided_ , that it delivers a copy thereof
substantially simultaneously to the other. With each submission, each
of Buyer and the Seller may also furnish to the Independent Accountant such
other information and documents as it deems relevant or such information and
documents as may be requested by the Independent Accountant; _provided_ , that
it delivers a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. The
Independent Accountant may, at its discretion, conduct one or more conferences
(whether in person or by teleconference) concerning the disagreement and each
of Buyer and the Seller shall have the right to present additional documents,
materials and other information and to have present its Representatives at
such conferences. No party shall have any _ex parte_ conversations or meetings
with the Independent Accountant (other than conversations or meetings
involving the submission of a request for documents or information by the
Independent Accountant to such party) without the prior written consent of the
other (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). 

(d) The Independent Accountant shall be directed to promptly, and in any event
within thirty (30) days after its appointment pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.5(c)_, render its decision on the Unresolved Matters (and not on any other
matter or calculation set forth in the Closing Statement). The Independent
Accountants determination as to each Unresolved

 



-21-  Matter shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to each of Buyer
and the Seller, which shall include the Independent Accountants (i)
determination as to the calculation of each of the Unresolved Matters and
(ii) the corresponding corrective calculations set forth in the Closing
Statement that are derived from its determination as to the calculation of
each of the Unresolved Matters, all of which shall be conclusive, final and
binding on all parties absent manifest error. In resolving any Unresolved
Matter, the Independent Accountant may not assign a value to such item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by Buyer in the
Closing Statement or by the Seller in the Dispute Notice or less than the
lowest value for such item claimed by Buyer in the Closing Statement or by the
Seller in the Dispute Notice. No party will disclose to the Independent
Accountant, and the Independent Accountant will not consider for any purpose,
any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any party, unless
otherwise agreed in writing between Seller and Buyer. The Independent
Accountants determination of the Unresolved Matters will be based solely on
the Closing Statement, the Dispute Notice, and written statements delivered to
the Independent Accountant or written responses (if any) to the Independent
Accountants inquiries (i.e., not on the basis of independent review) and
shall be made in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant incurred in the resolution of
the Unresolved Matters shall be allocated and paid by Buyer, on the one
hand, and by Seller, on the other hand, in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the Unresolved Items so submitted to the Independent
Accountant that is unsuccessfully disputed by such party (as finally
determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the total amount of
Unresolved Items submitted. For example, if Buyer contests only $500 of the
amount claimed by Seller, and if the Independent Accountant ultimately
resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the
costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant will be allocated 60% (i.e.,
300/500) to Buyer and 40% (i.e., 200/500) to Seller.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, subject to the fourth sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_, the " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in
the event that no Dispute Notice is delivered by the Seller to Buyer prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer
to the Seller pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_, (ii) in the event that a
Dispute Notice is delivered by the Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration of
the Review Period and Buyer and Seller agree on all matters set forth in such
Dispute Notice, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Seller
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_, as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of
Buyer and the Seller in writing, or (iii) in the event that a Dispute Notice
is delivered by the Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review
Period and Buyer and the Seller are unable to agree on all matters set forth
in such Dispute Notice, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to the Seller
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_, as adjusted by the Independent Account
to be consistent with (A) the Resolved Matters and (B) the Independent
Accountants determination as to the calculation of the Unresolved Matters
in accordance with _Sections_ __ _ 3.5(c)_ and _3.5(d)_.

 



-22- (f) _Payment of the Additional Transaction Consideration_.

 

(i) If the Final Transaction Consideration exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.5(e)_, Buyer shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to
an account or accounts designated by the Seller, the full amount by which the
Final Transaction Consideration exceeds the Estimated Transaction
Consideration (adjusted for any amounts previously paid or received pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_).

 

(ii) If the Estimated Transaction Consideration exceeds the Final Transaction
Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the final
determination of the Final Closing Statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
3.5(e)_, Seller shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to
an account or accounts designated by Buyer, the full amount by which the
Estimated Transaction Consideration exceeds the Final Transaction
Consideration (adjusted for any amounts previously paid or received pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 3.5(b)_).

 

(g) All payments pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Transaction Consideration for all foreign, federal,
state and local income Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law.

 

(h) The parties agree that the Seller and its Affiliates may engage Ernst and
Young LLP and its Affiliates to advise or represent them in connection with
the determination of any Additional Transaction Consideration and the matters
addressed by this _Section_ __ _ 3.5_. Each party shall (and shall cause its
Affiliates to) enter into such waivers, indemnities and other agreements as
Ernst and Young LLP and/or its Affiliates shall reasonably require to permit
Ernst and Young LLP and its Affiliates to provide such advice or representation.

 

3.6 _Withholding Taxes_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause
to be deducted and withheld, from any amounts payable to any Person pursuant
to the transactions contemplated hereby such amounts as may be required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law;
_provided_ , that prior to making any such deduction or withholding, the
applicable withholding entity shall, to the extent reasonably practicable,
provide notice to the recipient of the amounts subject to withholding and a
reasonable opportunity for such recipient to provide forms or other evidence
that would exempt such amounts from withholding tax. The withheld amounts
shall be paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority and treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, (b) the representations and

respective Subsidiaries shall be Solvent. No transfer of property is being
made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud
either present or future creditors of the Company or the Companys
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Solvent_ " when used with

Present Fair Salable Value of its assets will, as of such date, exceed all of

will not have, or have access to, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the business in which it is engaged or will be engaged
and (c) such Person will be able to pay its debts as they become absolute and
mature, in the ordinary course of business, taking into account the timing of
and amounts of cash to be received by it and the timing of and amounts of cash
to be payable on or in respect of its indebtedness, in each case,
after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
term " _Solvency_ " shall have a correlative meaning. For purposes of the
definition of " _Solvent_ " (i) "debt" means liability on a "claim" and (ii)
"claim" means (A) any right to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced
to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured,
disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured or (B) the right to an equitable
remedy for a breach in performance if such breach gives rise to a right to
payment, whether or not such equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed,
undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured. " _Present Fair Salable
Value_ " means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets of such
Person (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with
reasonable promptness in an arms length transaction under present conditions
for the sale of comparable business enterprises. Buyer has on the date hereof,
and shall maintain at all times through the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement, sufficient cash, available lines of credit, or other sources of
immediately available funds to enable it to pay the Termination Fee.

its own account with the present intention of holding such securities for
investment purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with,
any distribution of such securities in violation of any federal or state
securities laws. Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined in Regulation D

 



-42-  promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. Buyer acknowledges that it
is informed as to the risks of the transactions contemplated hereby and of
ownership of the Capital Stock. Buyer acknowledges that the Capital Stock has
not been registered under the Securities Act, or any state or foreign

pursuant to the terms of an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act and the Capital Stock is registered under any applicable state
or foreign securities laws or sold pursuant to an exemption from registration
under the Securities Act and any applicable state or foreign securities laws.

 

6.10 _Brokers and Other_ _Advisors_. Except for Barclays Capital Inc., the
fees and expenses of which shall be borne by Buyer, no broker, investment
banker, financial advisor or other Person is entitled to any brokers,
finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission, or the
reimbursement of expenses in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates for which the Seller may become liable.

Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, agrees
to use its respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,

any substantive meeting or conference call with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry without giving
the other prior notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such

cause to be prepared and filed any notification and report form and related
material required under the HSR Act no later than ten (10) Business Days after

or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or pursuant to a Competition Law or other applicable Law. Buyer
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause (and shall cause its "ultimate
parent entity" as that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings
under the HSR Act to be considered for grant of "early termination," and make
any further filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or
advisable in connection therewith. Buyer shall be responsible for the filing
fees under the HSR Act, any other Competition Laws and/or under any such other
laws or regulations applicable to Buyer or Seller, the Company and its

-48-  best efforts to (i) oppose or defend against any action to prevent or enjoin
consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions contemplated herein),
and/or (ii) overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the
transactions contemplated herein), including by defending any Action brought
by any Governmental Antitrust Entity in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, in order
to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Antitrust
Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such Competition
Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, take all actions
necessary to avoid or eliminate any impediment under any U.S. Competition Law
so as to enable the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Purchase, to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any
event no later than the Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating,
committing to and effecting, by consent decree, a hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses, product lines
or assets of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), (ii) terminating existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of Buyer or its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries), (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement of Buyer or
its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and (iv)
otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing Date
would limit Buyers or its Subsidiaries (including the Companys and its
Subsidiaries), freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), and to otherwise
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or
permanent injunction which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the

the Company and its Subsidiaries) to, agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits
its freedom of action with respect to Buyers or its Subsidiaries (including
the Companys and its Subsidiaries), ability to retain, any of the
businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries). Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall require or obligate Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co. L.P. (" _KKR_ ") to
agree or otherwise be required to sell, divest, dispose of, license, hold
separate, or take or commit to take any action that limits in any respect its
freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of its
businesses, products, rights, services, licenses, investments, or assets or
those of any of its affiliated investment funds or portfolio companies (as
such term is commonly understood in the private equity industry), or any
interests therein, other than Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries).

(e) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of termination of
the required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all applicable Competition
Laws and (ii) the consents required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_ are
obtained, Buyer, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall not take
any action that could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay, as
applicable, the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting periods under the HSR Act and such applicable Competition Laws, or
the obtaining of the consents required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.5(a)_
from the applicable Governmental Authorities.

 



-49- 7.6 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_ _._

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, the individuals who are now, or have been at any time prior to
the date hereof, or who become prior to the Closing Date, directors or
officers of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _D
andO Indemnitees_") with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such or taken at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be liable for any
indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ arising from
any settlement effected without the prior written consent of Buyer. Any DandO
Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_,
upon learning of any claim for which it may seek indemnification
hereunder, shall promptly notify Buyer and the Company in writing; _provided_
that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Buyer, the
Company or its Subsidiaries except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices Buyer, the Company or its Subsidiaries. For a period of
six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, Buyer agrees that all rights of
the DandO Indemnitees to advancement of expenses, indemnification and
exculpation from Liabilities for acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Closing Date as provided in (x) the certificate of incorporation or the
bylaws of the Company, or (z) the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements of the Company,
and/or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a
period of six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, such rights shall
not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights of any of the DandO Indemnitees, unless such modification is required
by Law or approved by each such adversely affected DandO Indemnitee. In
addition, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, to advance, pay and/or reimburse any expenses of any DandO
Indemnitee under this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the person to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent
required by applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or
similar organizational documents) of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any
indemnification agreements of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case as now in effect.

 

(b) Buyer, from and after the Closing Date and for six (6) years thereafter,
shall cause (i) the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company to
contain provisions no less favorable to the DandO Indemnitees with respect to
limitation of Liability, advancement of expenses and indemnification than are
set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the certificate of
incorporation and the bylaws of the Company and (ii) the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of each
Subsidiary of the Company to contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to limitation of Liability, advancement of expenses and
indemnification of partners, members, directors, officers, employees and
agents, than are set forth in such documents as of the date of this Agreement.

 



-50- (c) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and cause its Affiliates to
reasonably cooperate, in the defense of any claim that is subject to the
limitation of liability, advancement of expenses and/or indemnification as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ and shall provide access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be
furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith. 

(d) The Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide or maintain
in effect for six (6) years from and after the Closing Date, through the
purchase of "run-off" coverage or otherwise, directors and officers and
corporate liability insurance covering those individuals who are covered by
the directors and officers and corporate liability insurance policies
provided for directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the date hereof (the " _Existing Policies_ ") on terms (including
coverage, deductibles and limits of liability) which, in the aggregate, are
no less favorable to such DandO Indemnitees as the Existing Policies; _provided_
, _however_ , that if such "run-off" or other coverage is not available at a
cost equal to or less than three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums
paid as of the date hereof under the Existing Policies (the " _Insurance Cap_
") (which premiums are set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), then the Buyer shall only be required to, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, obtain as much coverage as is possible under
substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed the
Insurance Cap.

(e) The obligations of Buyer, and the Company under this  _Section_ __ _
7.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any DandO Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ applies without
the consent of each affected DandO Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that
the DandO Indemnitees to whom this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ applies shall be third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_). The provisions of this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_ (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee, his, her or its heirs and his or her
representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by Law, Contract or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Buyer or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made by Buyer and the
Company so that the successors and assigns of the Company, as applicable,
shall assume all of the obligations thereof set forth in this _Section_ __ _
7.6_.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_ is not prior to or in substitution
for any such claims under such policies.

 



-51- 7.7 _Preservation of Records_.

 

(a) Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, preserve
and keep the records held by them relating to the conduct prior to the
Closing of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of
seven (7) years from and after the Closing Date (or longer if required by
applicable Law) and shall make such records (or copies) and officers,
management, employees, advisors and Representatives available, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable advance notice, to the Seller, and any of its
Affiliates and/or Representatives as may be reasonably required by such Person
in connection with any insurance claims by, Actions or Tax audits against,
governmental investigations of, compliance with legal requirements by, or the
preparation of financial statements of, the Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than with respect to Actions or claims relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any Buyer Document, Seller Document or Company
Document); provided, however, that (a) Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries
may refuse access to the extent either of them reasonably determines such
access would unreasonably interfere with or disrupt any of the businesses or
operations of Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries; and
(b) neither Buyer, the Company nor their respective Subsidiaries shall be
required to so confer, afford such access or furnish such copies or other
information to the extent that (x) doing so would result in the breach of any
confidentiality or similar agreement to which Buyer, the Company or any of
their Subsidiaries is a party or the loss of attorney-client privilege
(provided Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
use their respective reasonable best efforts to, make appropriate
substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of this
clause (x) apply), or (y) the relevant matters or books and records relate
solely to Buyer and none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or their
respective businesses.

 

(b) The Public Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, preserve and
keep the records held by them relating to the businesses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for a period of seven (7) years from and after the Closing
Date (or longer if required by applicable Law) and shall make such records (or
copies) and officers, management, employees, advisors and Representatives
available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, to Buyer
and any of its Affiliates and/or Representatives as may be reasonably required
by such Person in connection with any insurance claims by, Actions or
Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, compliance with legal
requirements by, or the preparation of financial statements of, the Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (other than with respect to Actions or claims relating
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Buyer Document,
Seller Document or Company Document); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the
Public Company and its Affiliates may refuse access to the extent any of them
reasonably determines such access would unreasonably interfere with or
disrupt any of the businesses or operations of them; and (b) neither the
Public Company nor its Affiliates shall be required to so confer, afford such
access or furnish such copies or other information to the extent that (x)
doing so would result in the breach of any confidentiality or similar
agreement to which the Public Company or any of its Affiliates is a party or
the loss of attorney-client privilege (provided the Public Company shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, use their respective

 



-52-  reasonable best efforts to, make appropriate arrangements, including
entering into joint defense or similar agreements with Public Company and its
Subsidiaries, to protect and maintain the attorney-client privilege and make
appropriate substitute arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of this clause (x) apply), or (y) the relevant matters or books
and records relate solely to the Public Company or its Affiliates and none of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses.

(c) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and
its Subsidiaries to, and the Public Company shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, comply with the requirements of any "Litigation Hold" that
relates to the records subject to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.7_ held by such
Party that relate to (x) any Action that is pending as of the Closing Date or
(y) any Action that arises or becomes threatened or reasonably anticipated
after the Closing Date as to which such Party has received written notice of
the applicable "Litigation Hold" from the other Party.

(d) After the Closing Date, except in the case of an adversarial Action or
dispute between Buyer and its Affiliates and Seller or as prohibited by
applicable Law, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts (which shall
not impose undue burden on such Party) to make available to the other Party,
upon written request, its former and then-current directors, officers,
employees, other personnel and agents as witnesses and any books, records or
other documents within its possession, custody or control, to the extent that
any such person (giving consideration to business demands of such directors,
officers, employees, other personnel and agents) or books, records or other
documents may reasonably be required in connection with any Action (other
than with Buyer and its Affiliates) in which the requesting Party may from
time to time be involved, regardless of whether such Action is a matter with
respect to which indemnification may be sought hereunder, in each case to the
extent that any of the foregoing would not reasonably be likely to result in
a waiver of a Partys attorney-client privilege (provided Buyer shall, and
shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, use their respective
reasonable best efforts to make appropriate arrangements, including entering
into joint defense or similar agreements with Public Company and its
Subsidiaries, to protect and maintain the attorney-client privilege). The
requesting Party shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
in connection therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall
cooperate and consult with each other to the extent reasonably necessary with
respect to any Actions.

(e) In the event that Public Company or its Subsidiaries (other than
the Company and its Subsidiaries) possess any financial or operational
records or any clinical data relating to the Business, Public Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, transfer those records to the Company as
reasonably requested by the Company.

7.8 _Publicity_. Neither the Public Company, Seller, the Company nor their
Affiliates, on the one hand, nor Buyer nor its Affiliates, on the other hand,
shall issue any press release or public announcement or comment concerning
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the
prior written approval of Buyer or either the Company (prior to the Closing)
or the Public Company (at and after the Closing), respectively (which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless and only to
the extent, in the judgment of such party upon the advice of its
outside counsel, disclosure is required by applicable Law

 



-53-  (including the periodic reporting requirements under the Exchange Act) or
under the rules of any securities exchange on which the securities of such
party or any of its Affiliates are listed;  _provided_ , that to the extent
so required by applicable Law, the party intending to make such release shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to
consult with the other parties in advance of such release with respect to the
text thereof.

7.9 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Buyer covenants and agrees to cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to,
for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, provide to each
Continuing Employee (i) total annual compensation, including annual base
salary or base wages and target short-term (annual or more frequent) cash
incentive compensation opportunities, in each case, that are no less
favorable than such total annual compensation provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, (ii) severance compensation
benefits to any Continuing Employees during the one (1) year period following
the Closing Date at levels at least equivalent to the levels of such
severance compensation benefits as in effect under the Benefit Plan under
which such Continuing Employee was eligible for severance immediately prior to
the Closing, and (iii) other employee benefits that are no less favorable
than those provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries under its employee benefit plans and arrangements following the
Closing. Company Employees immediately prior to the Closing who are common
law employees and who continue their employment with the Company or its
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Continuing Employees_ ".

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility and vesting and for determining the level and
entitlement to benefits, including the level or amount of vacation and
severance compensation benefits under the benefit and compensation plans,
programs, agreements and arrangements of Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees are eligible
to participate following the Closing (the " _Buyer Plans_ "), but excluding
under any defined benefit or retiree medical plans, programs, agreements and
arrangements, Buyer and the Company shall credit each Continuing Employee with
his or her years of service with the Company, the Companys Subsidiaries and
any predecessor entities, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was
entitled immediately prior to the Closing to credit for such service under any
similar Benefit Plan or if no such Benefit Plan was in effect, to the extent
permitted under the applicable Buyer Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such service shall be credited to the extent that it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service. In
addition, Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries will
cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any and all Buyer Plans, (ii) for purposes of
each Buyer Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision
benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Buyer Plan to be waived for such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent such
conditions were inapplicable or waived under the comparable Benefit Plans in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing,
and (iii) for the plan year in which the Closing occurs, the crediting of each
Continuing Employee with any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket
expenses paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable co-
payments, deductibles or out-of-pocket requirements under any Buyer Plan.

 



-54- (c) Except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement, Buyer shall
be responsible for any severance compensation or termination benefits payable
to any Company Employee who is terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) following the Closing.

 

(d) Seller shall be responsible for any severance, change-in-control,
retention, transaction, termination, incentive, bonus or similar amounts, if
any, payable to any Company Employee solely as a result of the consummation

Plan (subject, in each case, to the provisions of _Sections_ __ _ 7.9(a)_ and
_7.9(b)_ above) or to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee for

the fee letter related to the Secured Debt Commitment Letter) as promptly as
practicable (taking into account the Marketing Period), including using
reasonable best efforts to (A) maintain in full force and effect the

other terms that are no less favorable to Buyer than those contained in the
Commitment Letters (including any "flex" provisions applicable to the Secured
Debt Commitment Letter), which terms shall not in any respect expand on the
conditions to the funding of the Financing at the Closing or reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing available to be funded on the Closing Date

(the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (B) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into
account the expected timing of the Marketing Period) (or obtain the waiver
of) all conditions and covenants applicable to Buyer in the Commitment Letters
and such Financing Agreements that are to be satisfied by Buyer, if the

-55-  consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including by taking
enforcement action (including through litigation pursued in good faith) to
cause the Financing Sources, lenders and other Persons committing to provide
the Financing to comply with their obligations under the Commitment Letters
and the Financing Agreements and to fund such Financing at Closing, (C) fully
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and the Financing Agreements
and (ii) comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letters and the

reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of any material developments
concerning the status of the Financing which impact the availability of the

efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange to obtain
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, when
added to the portion of the Financing that is available and Cash on Hand and
the other cash available to Buyer and its Affiliates, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all related fees and
expenses (" _Alternative Financing_ ") as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event (taking into account the Marketing Period) and
to obtain, and when obtained, to provide the Company with a copy of, new
financing commitment(s) that provides for such Alternative Financing (the "
_Alternative Financing Commitment Letter_ "); _provided_ , that in no event
shall the Buyer be obligated to accept or pursue any Alternative Financing if
it is materially less favorable in any respect than the Debt Financing

knowledge thereof) notify the Company in writing (i) of any breach or default
(or any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or

any party to any Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreement, if such
breach or default would reasonably be expected to result in a material delay
of, or in any way materially limit, the availability of the Financing, (ii) of
the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any
written notice or other written communication from any Financing Source with
respect to any (A) actual or alleged breach, default, termination or

to the Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreement (including any proposal
by any Financing Source to withdraw, terminate or make a material change in
the terms of (including the amount of Financing contemplated by) the
Commitment Letters) or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among
any parties to any Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement (other than
ordinary course negotiations) with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, in each
case, that would make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or materially
delay the availability of the Financing, and (iii) if for any reason Buyer
believes in good faith that there is a material possibility that it will not
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the
Financing Agreements and (iv) of the termination or expiration of any
Commitment Letter or any Financing Agreement.

(d) Buyer shall not permit or consent to (i) any amendment, supplement or
modification being made to any Commitment Letter if such amendment,
supplement or modification would (A) change, expand or impose new conditions
precedent to the funding of the Financing from those set forth therein on the
date hereof, (B) change the timing of the funding of the Financing thereunder
in a manner reasonably expected to impair, delay or prevent the availability
of all or a portion of the Financing or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (C) reduce the aggregate cash amount of the
Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Financing (except as set forth in any "flex" provisions
existing on the date hereof) to an amount less than the amount required to

agents or similar entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters
as of the date hereof (but not to make any other prohibited changes)) or (ii)

references to any "Commitment Letter" shall include such document as
permitted or required by this _Section_ __ _ 7.10_ to be amended, modified or
waived, in each case from and after such amendment, modification or waiver.

(b) Except to the extent conditioned on the Closing, none of the Company, the
Companys Subsidiaries and their respective partners, members, directors,
managers, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel and other

7.16 _Tax_ _Matters_.

 

(a) _Straddle Periods._ For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the determination of the Taxes of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following
the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and
state and local apportionment factors of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the Straddle Period, shall be allocated between such two taxable years or
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the
Company and its Subsidiaries were closed at the close of the Closing Date.
However, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes
such as real and personal property taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between
such periods on a daily basis. For the avoidance of doubt, any estimated or
prepaid Taxes paid by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to a
Governmental Authority prior to the Closing Date in respect of any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period shall be for the account of the Seller and
shall reduce the amount of Taxes Buyer is entitled to receive pursuant to
_Article IX_. __

 



-60- (b) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Public Company shall include the income of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for taxable years (or portions thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date (including any deferred intercompany items described in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-13 and any excess loss accounts taken into income
under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19) in the Tax Returns of any
Public Company Group and shall pay any Taxes attributable to such income. The
Seller shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, (A) all Tax Returns with respect to any Public Company Group for
taxable years or periods ending before or including the Closing Date
(collectively, the " _Public Company Group Returns_ "), (B) all other income
Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to taxable years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
and (C) all other Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that are due prior to the Closing Date (those returns
described in clauses (B) and (C), collectively, the " _Seller Prepared
Returns_ "). All Public Company Group Returns (to the extent reporting the
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and Seller Prepared Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and, not less than
sixty (60) days prior to their due date (after applicable extensions), all
Seller Prepared Returns shall be submitted for Buyers review. Buyer
acknowledges that, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, (i) any
items described in the definition of Transaction Tax Deductions shall be
deducted for income tax purposes on the Public Company Group Returns for the
portion of the U.S. federal income tax period of the Company and its
Subsidiaries ending on the Closing Date and, accordingly, shall be for the
benefit of the Public Company, and (ii) the Company shall make the election
under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 with respect to the U.S. federal income tax
period ending on the Closing Date to apply the seventy percent (70%) safe
harbor to any "success-based fee" as defined in Treasury Regulations Section
1.263(a)-5(f). To the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
required to file any Seller Prepared Returns after the Closing Date, the Buyer
shall cause such Tax Returns to be properly and timely filed. The Seller
shall timely pay, or cause to be timely paid, all Taxes due with respect to
any Public Company Group Returns or Seller Prepared Returns to the extent such
Taxes were not taken into account in the determination of Final Transaction
Consideration.

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries other than
the Public Company Group Returns and the Seller Prepared Returns. All Tax
Returns to be filed by Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.16(b)(ii)_ covering a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice and, not less than sixty (60) days prior to
their due date (after applicable extensions), shall be submitted for Sellers
review and comment. Buyer shall make any changes reasonably requested by
Seller with respect to any such Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period. Upon written request, the Seller shall promptly reimburse the Buyer
for Taxes for which the Seller is liable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.3(a)(iii)_ but which are payable with any Tax Return filed by Buyer
pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.16(b)_.

 



-61- (c) _Amendments_. To the extent it would increase the amount of any
Tax liability subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_
of this Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to, (a) file, amend or otherwise modify any
Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries filed with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period except as expressly provided in
_Section_ __ _ 7.16(b)(ii)_, (b) make or change any Tax election with
respect to, or that has retroactive effect to, any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (c) voluntarily approach
any Governmental Authority with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or (d) extend or waive any
statute of limitations with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case without the prior
written consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, or except as required by Law or in the
ordinary course of business.

(d) _Tax Proceedings._

 

(i) In the event that Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Company
and its Subsidiaries following the Closing) receives notice from any
Governmental Authority of any pending or threatened audit, assessment, inquiry
or claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ") in respect of any (i) Seller Prepared Return or
(ii) any other Tax Return if such other Tax Return could result in payment of
a Tax liability subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.3(a)_ of this Agreement, Buyer shall promptly provide written notice to
Seller no later than twenty (20) days following the receipt by Buyer or its
Affiliates of any such notice. In the event that the Seller receives notice
from any Governmental Authority of any Tax Claim in respect of any Tax Return
or Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Seller shall promptly
provide written notice to Buyer no later than twenty (20) days following the
receipt by the Seller of any such notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
each case, the rights of the respective parties pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be adversely affected by the failure to timely provide
such notice, unless such failure actually and materially prejudices the other
party in the defense of such Tax Claim.

 

(ii) Seller shall have the sole right, at its cost and expense, to control,
defend, prosecute, settle and compromise any Tax Claim with respect to any
Public Company Group Return.

(iii) Seller shall, at the cost and expense of Seller, have the right (but
not the obligation) to control, defend, prosecute, settle and compromise any
Tax Claim with respect to (i) any Seller Prepared Return and (ii) any other
Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries that relates solely to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period to the extent such Tax Claim in respect of such other Tax
Return could result in a Tax liability subject to indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ of this Agreement, _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer
shall, at its cost and expense, be entitled to participate in such defense.
Buyer shall have the right to control, defend, prosecute, settle and
compromise any Tax Claim with respect to any Tax Return of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that the Seller does not elect to control, or is not entitled to
control, pursuant to the preceding sentence, _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Seller shall, at its cost and expense, be entitled to participate in such

 



-62-  defense to the extent such Tax Claim relates to a Straddle Period. The
Seller shall not settle or compromise any Tax Claim it controls pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 7.16(d)(iii)_ without Buyers consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if such settlement could
adversely affect Buyers (or its Affiliates, including the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries for tax periods other than Pre-Closing Tax Periods)
liability for Taxes. Buyer shall not settle or compromise any Tax Claim it
controls pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.16(d)(iii)_ without the Sellers
consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if
such settlement could adversely affect Sellers (or its Affiliates, including
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Tax Periods)
liability for Taxes (including any direct or indirect indemnification
obligation under this Agreement). This  _Section_ __ _ 7.16(d)_ shall
supersede anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

 

(e) _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, the Company or
its Subsidiaries, and any amounts credited against any Tax of Buyer, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to which Buyer or any such entity become
entitled to realize, in each case that relate to Tax liabilities for Pre-
Closing Tax Periods subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.3_, shall be for the account of the Seller, except to the extent any such
refund or credit arises as a result of the carryback of a loss sustained in a
taxable period other than a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company to, cooperate, as reasonably requested by the Seller, in
obtaining any Tax refund described in the preceding sentence, including, but
not limited to, by filing appropriate forms with the applicable Governmental
Authority. Buyer shall pay over to the Seller any such Tax refunds or amounts
of any such credit, net of Taxes and reasonable fees or expenses incurred by
Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiaries in obtaining such refund or credit,
within fourteen (14) Business Days after actual receipt or realization
thereto.

 

(f) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Any Tax sharing agreements between the Seller
and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the one
hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall be
terminated so that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
rights or obligations thereunder after the Closing

 

(g) _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate fully in connection with any
Tax matters relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (including by the
provision of reasonably requested relevant records or information).

(h) _Reduction of Attributes_. To the extent that any member of any Public
Company Group recognizes a loss on the sale of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as a result of any transaction contemplated herein, the Seller
will take action as necessary to ensure that no Tax attributes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries are reduced by reason of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-36 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law.

 

7.17 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) For a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing Date (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), the Public Company shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly engage in any business substantially
similar to or that otherwise competes with the Company or its Subsidiaries
anywhere in the world, or own the Equity Interests of, manage, operate or
control, any Person that engages in a business substantially similar to or
that otherwise competes with the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "
_Restricted Business_ ").

 



-63- (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 7.17_ shall not
operate to prevent or restrict the direct or indirect acquisition by the
Public Company or any of its Affiliates (through acquisition, merger or other
strategic transaction) of an interest in any Person that engages in the
Restricted Business and either (i) such Person does not have consolidated
total annual gross revenues derived from the Restricted Business (at the time

consolidated total annual gross revenue of the Company and its Subsidiaries
for the fiscal year ending prior to the Closing Date or (ii) the Public
Companys and Affiliates voting ownership interest in such Person does not
exceed 25% in the aggregate.

 

(c) During the Restricted Period, the Public Company agrees that none of the
Public Company or any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, (i)
hire (whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise) or (ii) solicit or
induce to leave the employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries or violate
the terms of their contracts, or any employment arrangements (and, during the
period prior to the Closing, the Public Company shall and shall cause its
Affiliates not to solicit or induce any Continuing Employee to leave the
employment of the Company or its Subsidiaries), any (x) director, officer
or employee of the company or its Subsidiaries employed by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates with the title of Vice President or higher or (y) any other
Continuing Employee or employee, representative or agent of the Company or its
Subsidiaries employed by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (provided that, the
foregoing shall not apply to the solicitation or hiring of (I) any such
Persons described in the preceding clause (y) whose employment has been

described in the preceding clause (y) who respond to general solicitations of
employment not specifically directed toward employees of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates).

(Miscellaneous) shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement in accordance with their respective terms. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Willful Breach_ " means a material
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or other agreement set
forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or failure to act by
the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or
failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause a
breach of this Agreement.

9.4 _Termination Fee_. In the event Seller terminates this Agreement as
provided above in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_, Buyer shall no later than five (5)
Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to
Seller an amount equal to $125,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Seller. Buyer agrees and confirms that the event or circumstance giving
rise to the obligation to pay the Termination Fee would cause significant
damage to Seller and that would be inherently difficult to quantify and
prove, that without the obligation to pay the Termination Fee under the
circumstances set forth herein, Seller would not enter into this Agreement and
that the Termination Fee provided for hereunder is intended to provide fair
compensation in response to that damage, is not intended to be punitive, and
is reasonable in amount in relation to the circumstances under which it would
become payable.

 

9.5 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of each party in the event of a breach (including any
Willful Breach) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement by another party will be (i) termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and pursuit of the post-
termination remedies permitted under _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ or _9.4_ , as
applicable, or (ii) specific performance in accordance with _Section_ __ _
11.1_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_ (or pursuant to any
other provision of _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ under circumstances in which it was
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(f)_),
the right of Seller to receive the Termination Fee (and any interest payable
thereon) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy against Buyer and any of its Affiliates, and the Financing Sources for
any Losses suffered by Seller, the Company and any of their respective
Affiliates or Nonparty Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no other amount shall be due
and payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates as a result thereof. For the
avoidance of doubt, while Seller may seek specific performance in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ and payment of the Termination Fee (and any
interest payable thereon) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, in no circumstance
shall Seller and the Company, collectively, be permitted or entitled to
receive (i) payment of monetary damages prior to the termination of this
Agreement or in amounts in excess of the Termination Fee, (ii) payment of both
monetary

 



-74-  damages and the Termination Fee or (iii) both a grant of specific
performance to cause the consummation of the Closing and payment of the
Termination Fee or any monetary damages, and in no circumstance will Buyer be
required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In no event
shall Seller or the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific
performance of this Agreement against any Financing Source in its capacity as
a lender, purchaser or arranger in connection with the Financing.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection
with any loss suffered as a result of any breach (including any Willful
Breach) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Financing, or in respect
of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith, in each case, other than in a circumstance in which Seller is
permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Termination Fee (and any
interest payable thereon) pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, Seller and the
Company agree that the maximum aggregate Liability of Buyer shall be limited
to an amount equal to the amount of the Termination Fee (and any interest
payable thereon), and in no event shall Seller, the Company or their
Affiliates seek to recover any money damages in excess of such amount. In no
event shall Seller or the Company seek to recover monetary damages from any
Nonparty Affiliate of Buyer (other than Buyer and other than pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement). The parties acknowledge that the agreements
contained in _Sections 9.3_ and _9.4_ and this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

10.2 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) The parties, intending to modify any applicable statute of
limitations hereby agree that the representations and warranties set forth in
_Sections 4.1_ , _4.2_ , _4.5_ , _4.21_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ , _5.5_ , _6.1_ ,
_6.2_ and _6.10_ shall survive indefinitely (collectively, the " _Specified
Representations_ "). The other representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall not survive beyond
the Closing and there shall be no Liability in respect thereof, whether such
Liability has accrued prior to or after the Closing, on the part of any party,
its Affiliates or any of their respective partners, members, directors,
manager, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel or other
Representatives, except for (i) those covenants and agreements that by their
terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing and
(ii) this _Article X_ and _Article XI_ , each of which shall survive in
accordance with its terms until fully performed.

 



-76- (b) If an Indemnitee delivers a notice in accordance with _Sections 10.3(c)_
 or _(h)_ with respect to a claim for any indemnification as provided for
under this _Article X_ before the expiration of the applicable survival
period, then the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of the matter
covered by such claim.

10.3 _Indemnification_ _._

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_ , from and after
the Closing, the Public Company and Seller agree, jointly and severally, to
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective
shareholders, directors, members, general and limited partners, managers,
officers, employees and agents (each, a " _Buyer Indemnitee_ ") from and
against any and all losses, Liabilities, out-of-pocket costs or expenses, or
other damages (collectively, " _Losses_ ") incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee
arising out of or resulting from (i) any breach of, or any inaccuracy in, any
Specified Representation by Seller or the Company when made or deemed made by
Seller or the Company in or pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate
delivered pursuant hereto, (ii) Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities, (iii) any
Transaction Costs that were unpaid as of the Closing and not included in the
calculation of the Final Transaction Consideration, and (iv) and the matters
set forth on _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
disregarding, in the case of clause (i) of this paragraph for purposes of the
determination of any Losses and the determination of the existence of any
breach or inaccuracy, any limitations or qualifications as to "material,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "Seller Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications set forth therein).

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article X_ , from and after
the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its
Affiliates and their shareholders, directors, members, general and limited
partners, managers, officers, employees and agents (each, a " _Seller
Indemnitee_ " and, together with the Buyer Indemnitees, the " _Indemnitees_
") from and against any and all Losses incurred by such Seller Indemnitee
arising out of or resulting from any breach of, or any inaccuracy in, any
Specified Representation by Buyer when made or deemed made by Buyer in or
pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto,
disregarding for purposes of the determination of any Losses and the
determination of the existence of any breach or inaccuracy, any limitations
or qualifications as to "material" or "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or
similar qualifications set forth therein.

 

(c) In order for any Indemnitee to make a claim for any indemnification as
provided for under this _Article X_ in respect of, arising out of or
involving a claim or demand made by any Person not a Party or its Affiliates
against the Indemnitee (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnitee must
promptly notify in writing the party from whom such indemnification is sought
hereunder (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), describing in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder (to the extent
then known) and including in such notice (if then known) the amount or the
method of

 



-77- computation of the amount of such claim, and a reference to the provision of
this Agreement upon which such claim is based, of the Third-Party Claim, but
any failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
Liability that it may have to the Indemnitee under _Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_
and  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially and adversely prejudiced by the failure to timely give
such notice. Thereafter, the Indemnitee shall promptly deliver to the
Indemnifying Party copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by Indemnitee relating to the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party shall have been materially and adversely prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

 

(d) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and, if it so
chooses by giving written notice to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days of
the receipt of notice of the Third-Party Claim, to assume and control the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; _provided_
that such counsel is not objected to by the Indemnitee in its reasonable
discretion. Should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnitee for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof (except in the case of a conflict of
interest as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.3(e)_). If the Indemnifying Party
assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in
the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. So long as the Indemnifying
Party is diligently defending any such claim, the Indemnitee shall not pay or
settle any such claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of
outside counsel engaged by the Indemnitee for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party is not assuming the defense thereof or at any time as set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 10.3(e)_ below.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(d)_ to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume and control
any Third-Party Claim if:

 

(i) the Indemnifying Party does not diligently defend such proceeding; or

 

(ii) there exists, in the Indemnitees reasonable and good faith judgment,
based on the advice of outside legal counsel, a conflict of interest between
the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party which, under applicable principles
of legal ethics, could reasonably be expected to prohibit a single legal
counsel from representing both the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party in
such proceeding.

(f) Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Indemnifying Party will
not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment, if such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) would result in any
remedy other than the payment of money for which the Indemnitee is fully
indemnified by the Indemnifying Party or if payment

 



-78-  of the claim would exceed the indemnity hereunder, or (ii) does not provide
for a full and unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all Liability with
respect to such Third-Party Claim from each claimant or plaintiff in such
Third-Party Claim. In the event that the Indemnifying Party does not timely
elect to assume and control the defense of the subject Third-Party Claim, or
is not permitted to do so pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.3(e)_ above, then
the Indemnitee may conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing,
the defense of, and with the consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), admit any
Liability, compromise or settle, the subject Third-Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate with and make available to the Indemnitee
such assistance and materials as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnitee. Under no circumstances will the Indemnifying Party have any
Liability in connection with any settlement of any Third-Party Claim that is
entered into without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). All the parties hereto will
reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such Third-Party Claim,
and the controlling party shall keep the other party reasonably informed as to
the status of such Third-Party Claim or any compromise or settlement offer
thereof. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the
Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying Party of
records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, subject to the execution of a mutually satisfactory joint defense
agreement, and making employees and other Representatives and advisors
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

(g) The indemnification provisions of this _Article X_ (i) shall apply
without regard to, and shall not be subject to, any limitation by reason of
set-off, limitation or otherwise and (ii) are intended to be comprehensive and
not to be limited by any requirements of Law concerning prominence of
language or waiver of any legal right under any Law.

(h) In the event any Indemnitee should have a claim against an Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall promptly
deliver to the Indemnifying Party a written notice describing in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim for indemnification
hereunder (to the extent then known) and shall include in such notice (if then
known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such claim,
and a reference to the provision of this Agreement upon which such claim is
based. The failure by any Indemnitee so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any Liability which it may have to
such Indemnitee, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been materially and adversely prejudiced as a result
of such failure.

(i) After the giving of any notice of indemnification claim pursuant to this
_Article X_ , the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnitee shall be
entitled shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party; (ii) by a judgment or decree of any
court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the
Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party shall agree. All amounts due to the
Indemnitee as so finally determined shall be paid by wire transfer within ten
(10) days after such final determination.

 



-79- (j) The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon
any representations, warranties, covenants and obligations set forth in this
Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect
to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. The waiver of any condition
based upon the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not affect
the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based upon such
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations.

 

(k) The parties agree that any indemnification made pursuant to this _Article
X_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Final Transaction Consideration
for all foreign, federal, state, and local income Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

10.4 _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) The maximum aggregate Liability of the Public Company and Seller, on the
one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, as the case may be, pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 10.3(b)_ shall not exceed the
Final Transaction Consideration; _provided_ that this limitation shall not
apply to any indemnity claim relating to Tax matters, including Pre-Closing
Tax Liabilities.

(b) For the purposes of calculating Losses to which the Indemnitees are
entitled under this _Article X_ , (i) except to the extent actually paid to an
unrelated third party as a result of a final, non-appealable determination in
respect of a Third-Party Claim, such Losses shall not include any punitive or
exemplary damages; (ii) such Losses shall be determined without duplication of
recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Loss constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement; (iii) such Losses shall not include any amounts of such
Losses which were taken into account (including with respect to any reserves)
in the determination of the amount of any post-Closing adjustment pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_; (iv) such Losses shall be reduced by the amount of any
proceeds that any Indemnitee actually receives pursuant to the terms of any
insurance policies, indemnities or other reimbursement arrangements, in each
case, net of any insurance premium increases resulting therefrom with respect
to such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , such Indemnitee shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any subsequent recoveries of the amount
of such previously indemnified Losses (if previously indemnified hereunder) so
as to avoid a double recovery; (v) such Losses shall be reduced by the amount
of any actual prior or subsequent recovery by Indemnitee from any other
Person with respect to such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , such Indemnitee
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any subsequent recoveries
of the amount of such previously indemnified Losses (if previously
indemnified hereunder) so as to avoid a double recovery, and (vi) such Losses
shall be reduced by the amount by which the Tax liability of a party, with
respect to a taxable period, is actually reduced as a result of such Losses
(net of any Tax cost actually incurred by the party arising from the receipt
of the indemnity payments hereunder), calculated by computing the amount of
Taxes before and after inclusion of any Tax items attributable to such Losses
for which indemnification was made and treating such Tax items attributable
to such Losses as the last items claimed for such taxable period; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such Indemnitee shall

 



-80-  promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any subsequent recoveries of
the amount of such previously indemnified Losses (if previously indemnified
hereunder) so as to avoid a double recovery;  _provided_ in each case that an
Indemnitee shall be under no obligation to seek such recovery. If Buyer fails
to pursue or unsuccessfully obtain recoveries under any applicable insurance
policies, then the Seller, without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_ or any of its other rights or remedies hereunder,
shall have the right of subrogation to pursue such insurance policies and may
take any reasonable actions necessary to pursue such rights of subrogation in
its name.

10.5 _Exclusive Remedies Following the Closing Date_. Following the Closing,
except in the case of actual common law fraud or Willful Breach in the making
of representations and warranties, the indemnification provisions of this
Article X shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the Indemnitees
for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for breach of contract,
warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise and whether
predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or otherwise) for any
breach of any (i) representation or warranty or (ii) any covenant, agreement
or obligation to be performed prior to the Closing, in either case set forth
herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any
certificate delivered in connection herewith, will be the
indemnification and/or reimbursement obligations of the parties set forth in
this _Article X_ _._ In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereby waives, from and after the Closing Date, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights and claims for Losses it
may have against any other party to this Agreement for any breach of any (i)
representation or warranty or (ii) covenant, agreement or obligation to be
performed prior to the Closing, in either case set forth herein or otherwise
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any certificate delivered
in connection herewith, any applicable Law, common law or otherwise (except
pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this  _Article X_ or
in the case of actual common law fraud or Willful Breach in the making of
representations and warranties). The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 10.5_
shall not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action under  _Section_ __ _
11.1_ to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

 

10.6 _Successors and Assigns_. In the event that an Indemnifying Party or any
of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates or merges with or into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made by the Public Company or Buyer so that the
successors and assigns of the Indemnifying Party, as applicable, shall assume
all of the obligations thereof set forth in this Article X.

 



-81- ARTICLE XI

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

11.1  _Remedies_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to perform or breach.
Accordingly, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)_, the parties
hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by Seller and/or the Company, on the one hand, or Buyer, on
the other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth
in this Agreement, Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller and/or the Company, on
the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable)
under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without bond or other security being required, and this right shall
include the right of Seller and the Company to cause Buyer to fully enforce
the terms of the Commitment Letters, including by requiring Buyer to file one
or more lawsuits against the Financing Sources to fully enforce the Financing
Sources obligations under the Commitment Letters. Except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)_ the pursuit of specific enforcement or other
equitable remedies by any party hereto will not be deemed an election of
remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether
at law or in equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Seller or the Company
commences a lawsuit that results in a judgment against Buyer to specifically
enforce (i) Buyers obligations under this Agreement or (ii) Buyers
obligations under the terms of the Commitment Letters, Buyer shall pay to
Seller and the Company the costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) of
Seller and the Company in connection with such lawsuit.

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will
be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any other remedy.

 

(c) Each of Seller and the Company, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the
equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement by Seller or the Company or Buyer, as
applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of
this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the Seller, the Company or
Buyer, as applicable, under this Agreement. The parties hereto further agree
that, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.1(d)_, (i) by seeking the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_, a party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may
be available to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ are not available or
otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _
11.1_ shall require any party hereto to institute any proceeding for (or limit
any partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under
this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ prior or as a condition to exercising any
termination right under _Article IX_ (and pursuing monetary damages after such
termination to the extent permitted by  _Section_ __ _ 9.3_ and _Section_ __
_ 9.5_), nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.1_ or anything set

 

forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.1_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article IX_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter.

 



-82- (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, it
is explicitly agreed that the right of Seller and the Company to obtain an
injunction, or other appropriate form of equitable relief to cause Buyer to
complete the Closing shall be subject to the requirement that (i) all
conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but provided that each of which shall be capable of being satisfied
if the Closing Date were on such date), (ii) the Financing has been funded in
full or would be funded in full at the Closing if the Closing were to occur,
(iii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.2_ when required to do so hereunder and (iv) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Financing is funded,
then the Closing will occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. In addition, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no
event shall Seller and the Company be entitled to receive both (x) a grant of
specific performance to cause the Closing to be consummated and (y) payment of
the Termination Fee (and any interest payable thereon) pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 9.4_.

11.2 _Payment of Transfer Taxes_. All sales, use, transfer, intangible,
recordation, documentary stamp or similar Taxes or charges, of any nature
whatsoever, applicable to, or resulting from, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be borne equally by the Buyer and the Seller. 

11.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Company, Seller and Buyer shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Buyer shall pay the fees
and expenses of Seller and the Company as contemplated in _Sections 7.5(b)_
and _7.11(b)_.

11.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement (including
the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and the Company Disclosure Schedule) and the
Confidentiality Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This
Agreement may only be amended, supplemented or changed by a written instrument
signed by each of the parties hereto. Each provision in this Agreement may
only be waived by written instrument making specific reference to this
Agreement signed by the party against whom enforcement of any such provision
so waived is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute
a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver
by any party hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not
operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or
as a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any
party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
Notwithstanding anything

 



-83-  to the contrary contained herein, none of the Financing Source Sections (and
any other provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of the Financing Source Sections) may be amended, modified, waived
or terminated in any manner adverse to the Financing Sources identified in the
Commitment Letters in any material respect without the prior written consent
of the applicable Financing Source.

11.5 _Govern_ _ing Law_.

 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law
of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern
under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (a) submits, for itself and its
property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement), or for recognition
or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such Delaware Court
of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware), (b) waives, to the fullest
extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or,
only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any Federal court of the United States of America sitting
in the State of Delaware) or any appellate court from any thereof, (c)
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court and
(d) agrees that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to it at the applicable address set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.7_
below shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court.

 

(b) Each of the parties agrees that it will not bring or support any suit,
action or legal proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources and their respective Affiliates and Representatives in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated 

 



-84-  by this Agreement, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Commitment Letters or the performance thereof,
in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof) and, except as set forth in the
Commitment Letters, any such suit, action or legal proceeding shall be
governed by the laws of the State of New York, and makes the agreements,
waivers and consents set forth in _Section_ __ _ 11.5(a)_ _mutatis mutandis_
but with respect to the courts specified in this _Section_ __ _ 11.5(b)_.

11.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT
LETTERS OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING ANY SUCH
ACTION INVOLVING ANY FINANCING SOURCE OR THE FINANCING) OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A
COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING,
VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE
TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS OR ANY TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. 

11.7 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally
by hand (with written confirmation of receipt, by other than automatic means,
whether electronic or otherwise), (b) when sent by facsimile or e-mail (with
written confirmation of transmission) or (c) one (1) Business Day following

11.8  _Severability_. If any condition, term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law or
public policy, all other conditions, terms or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions of
_Article IX_ and _Article X_ , including the remedies (and limitations
thereon) and the limitations on representations, warranties and covenants, be
construed as integral provisions of this Agreement and that such provisions,
remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes
a partys rights hereunder or increases a partys Liability or obligations
hereunder.

 



-86- 11.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement except (i) _ Section_ __ _
7.6_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the DandO Indemnitees,
(ii) _Section 11.10_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the
Nonparty Affiliates of the parties, (iii) _Section 11.11_ shall be for the
benefit of, and enforceable by BBS, and (iv) the Financing Source Sections
and this _Section_ __ _ 11.9(a)(vi)_ shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, the Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates and
Representatives. Without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties hereto
acknowledges to each of the Financing Sources, as an explicit third party
beneficiary, such Financing Sources direct rights against such party under
the Financing Source Sections and this  _Section_ __ _ 11.9(a)_, which are
intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Financing
Source, its successors, assigns, heirs and its legal representatives.

 

(b) No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder
may be made, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), by
(i) the Company or Seller, without the prior written consent of Buyer or (ii)
Buyer, without the prior written consent of either the Company and Seller
(prior to the Closing) or the Seller (at and after the Closing),
respectively. Any attempted assignment without obtaining such required consent
shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may assign this
Agreement (in whole but not in part) to one or more wholly owned Subsidiaries
of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve
Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in no event shall Buyer be permitted to assign this Agreement to any Person to
the extent such that, as a result of such assignment, any delay would occur
with respect to any consent or approval of, or filing, declaration or
registration with, any Governmental Authority that otherwise is required to be
made under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

11.10 _Non-Recourse_. Except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all claims, obligations, Liabilities, or causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with, or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an inducement
to, this Agreement), may be made only against (and such representations and
warranties are those solely of) the Persons that are expressly identified as
parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No
Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any Financing Source, any
current, former or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, representative or
assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party or
any Financing Source, or any current, former or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney, representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or
lender to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Nonparty Affiliates_ "),
shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity,
or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than
as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such
Liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted

 



-87-  by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases any and all
rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may otherwise be available
at law or in equity, or granted by statute, to avoid or disregard the entity
form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability of a Contracting
Party on any Nonparty Affiliate, whether granted by statute or based on
theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego, domination,
sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise; and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement.

 

11.11 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. It is acknowledged by each
of the parties that Seller and the Company have retained Bass, Berry and Sims
PLC (" _BBS_ ") to act as its counsel in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and that BBS has not acted as counsel for any other party
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that none of the
other parties has the status of a client of BBS for conflict of interest or
any other purposes as a result thereof. Each of Buyer, Seller and the Company
hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, BBS may represent the
Seller in such dispute even though the interests of the Seller may be directly
adverse to Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and
even though BBS formerly may have represented the Company and/or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in a matter substantially related to such dispute;
_provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not apply if BBS, at the
time of such dispute, is handling ongoing matters for Buyer, the Company
and/or any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, in
connection with any future dispute between Buyer, the Company and/or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Seller and its Affiliates, on the
other hand, with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
as to all communications among BBS, Seller, the Company or any of
the Companys Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing that relate in any way
to the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Privileged Deal Communications_ "), the attorney-client privilege and
the expectation of client confidence belongs to the Seller and may be
controlled by the Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the
Company or any of its Affiliates. Accordingly, Buyer, the Company and its
Affiliates shall not have access to any Privileged Deal Communications, or to
the files of BBS relating to any engagement described in this _Section_ __ _
11.11_, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred. Buyer, the Company
and/or any of its Affiliates shall not assert or use Privileged Deal
Communications for the purpose of asserting, prosecuting or litigating any
Action against the Seller and its Affiliates. Each of Buyer and the Company
acknowledges and agrees that any disclosure of the Privileged Deal
Communications will not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any
claim of privilege, and Buyer and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to return promptly any inadvertently disclosed Privileged Deal
Communications to the appropriate Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x)
in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Company or their then-
Affiliates following the Closing, on the one hand, and a third party other
than the Seller and any of its then-Affiliates (solely in their capacity as
former direct or indirect equityholders of the Company), on the other hand,
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective

 



-88-  Subsidiaries may assert the attorney-client privilege with respect to
Privileged Deal Communications to such third party and (y) subject to and
without waiver of the foregoing, and for the avoidance of doubt, each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees that any pre-Closing attorney-client privilege
and other privilege or immunity attaching to any communication, advice or
materials pertaining to the Company and its Subsidiaries that would be
relevant to Buyer after the Closing, but not related to the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement belongs to and shall be
controlled by the Company.

 

11.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts (including by means of facsimile or e-mail in .pdf format), each
of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all of
which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement.
