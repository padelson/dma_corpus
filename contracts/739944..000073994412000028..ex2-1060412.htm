AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  


 

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 3, 2012 (this
"Agreement"), is among Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Mercer Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and MEDTOX Scientific, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain terms used in this Agreement
are used as defined in Section 8.11.

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved this Agreement and the merger of Merger Sub with and
into the Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger, shares of the Company's common stock, par
value $0.15 per share ("Company Common Stock") shall be, except as otherwise
provided herein, converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(as defined herein) in the manner and on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I THE MERGER

  

  

Section 1.1 The Merger.

  

  

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation") and shall continue its existence under the DGCL as a
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

  

  

Section 1.2 Closing.

  

  

Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement abandoned pursuant to the provisions of Article
VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on a date to be specified by the parties (the "Closing
Date"), which date shall be no later than the third business day after
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at such time), at
the offices of Hogan Lovells US LLP, 875 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022,
unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

  

 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

 

  

Section 1.3 Effective Time.

  

  

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date the parties shall file with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") satisfying
the applicable requirements of the DGCL and duly executed in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger or at such later time as is agreed to
by the parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the time at
which the Merger becomes effective is herein referred to as the "Effective
Time").

  

  

Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger.

  

  

The Merger shall have the effects set forth in applicable provisions of
Delaware law and this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 5.7(b), at the Effective Time the certificate of
incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be amended in the Merger to be in the form of Exhibit A hereto
and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.7(b), at the Effective Time the bylaws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law.

  

  

Section 1.6 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary action to cause the
directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
to be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 1.7 Subsequent Actions.

  

  

If at any time after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments
of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions
and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any
and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES; COMPANY EQUITY AWARDS

  

  

Section 2.1 Effect on Capital Stock.

  

  

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of any shares of Company
Common Stock ("Shares") or of any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be automatically converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Company and Parent-Owned Stock. Any Shares that are owned
by the Company or owned by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Shares held
in the rabbi trusts established for the Deferred Compensation Plans, which
shall instead be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(defined below) in accordance with Section 2.1(c)), and any Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding Share
(other than Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $27.00 (the "Merger
Consideration"). The Shares that are so converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) are referred to
herein as the "Merger Shares."

  

  

(d) Adjustment to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 3-  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and which are held by a stockholder who did not vote in favor
of the Merger (or consent thereto in writing or who otherwise did not validly
waive their right to appraisal) and who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Stockholders"), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right
to receive the Merger Consideration (the "Dissenting Shares"), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the
Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holder
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder shall
have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to
appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such
stockholder's Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted
into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration for each such Share, in accordance with Section
2.1(c), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders' rights of
appraisal, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make
any payment with respect to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such
demand for payment or waive any failure by a stockholder to timely comply with
the requirements of the DGCL to perfect or demand appraisal rights. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 2.2 to pay for Shares for which appraisal rights have been
perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

  

  

Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company to act as paying agent in connection with the Merger (the
"Paying Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit the
aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Merger Shares shall become
entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(c) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of the Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation; provided, that (i) no such investment
gains or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the
holders of Shares and following any losses that result in the amount of funds
in the Payment Fund being insufficient to pay the portion of the aggregate
Merger Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the former
stockholders of the Company to the extent of such insufficiency and (ii) such
investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States of
America. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as
provided in this Agreement.

  

  


 

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 4-  

  

 

 

 

 

  


 

  

(b) Payment Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time but in any event no
later than five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Merger Share (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the certificates representing the Merger Shares (the
"Certificates") and to any uncertificated Merger Shares held in book-entry
form ("Uncertificated Shares") shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent, and
which shall be in such form and shall have such other provisions as is
customary) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon (i) surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions (and
such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying
Agent), or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by the Paying Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may require) in the
case of book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each Merger
Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share, and
the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or transferred shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or
transferred Uncertificated Shares is registered, it shall be a condition of
payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares
shall be properly transferred and (y) the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article II, without interest. If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to the trustee of the rabbi
trusts established for the Deferred Compensation Plans, the trustee shall
promptly distribute the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of
the Deferred Compensation Plans and applicable trust agreements.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, as to holders of Restricted Stock, Parent shall
cause the Paying Agent to distribute the Merger Consideration allocable to
such shares of Restricted Stock to the Company for payment as Adjusted Award
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.3(c).

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock. The
Merger Consideration paid in respect of the Merger Shares upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or transfer of Uncertificated Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Merger Shares previously
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, and at the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Merger Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor, without interest, upon
compliance with the provisions of Section 2.2(b) or as otherwise provided by
applicable Law. Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.2(e), if, at any
time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 5-  

  

 

 

 

 

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such customary amount and upon such customary terms as Parent or the Paying
Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Merger Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article II.

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following 12 months after the Closing
Date, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that had been
made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to
holders of Merger Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to
look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar
laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the payment of any Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon surrender of any Certificates or
transfer of any Uncertificated Shares held by such holders, as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts
remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or

required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such

Section 2.3 Company Stock Options; Restricted Stock.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide that (i) each Option outstanding as of the Closing Date shall be
fully vested and exercisable prior to the Effective Time and (ii) each Option
outstanding under the Company Stock Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and terminated and of no further force or effect as of
the Effective Time and, unless exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall,
to the extent the exercise price thereof is less than the Merger
Consideration, instead represent solely the right to receive from the Company
payment in cash (subject to any applicable withholding or other Taxes required
by applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with Section 2.2(g)) of an
amount equal to the product of (A) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Option and (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Option (each such amount payable hereunder, if any, or any
other amount paid in respect of an Option, a "Stock Option Payment"). The
Company shall pay the Stock Option Payments, if any, promptly following the
Effective Time to the persons entitled thereto in accordance with the
Company's standard payroll practices.

  

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to provide holders of Options with written notice that (i) their Options may

effect as described in Section 2.3(a).

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board of Directors (or, if
appropriate or required, any committee of the Company Board of Directors
administering the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan) will adopt such resolutions and
the Company shall take all such other actions as may be required to adjust the
terms of all outstanding awards of Restricted Stock (each, a "Restricted Stock
Award") to provide that, at the Effective Time, each Restricted Stock Award
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be deemed to instead
constitute an award of the Merger Consideration per Share (the "Adjusted Award
Consideration") with respect to each Share of Restricted Stock formerly
represented by such Restricted Stock Award; provided, that all other terms and
conditions applicable to such Restricted Stock Award shall remain the same
following the Effective Time (other than for such ministerial changes as
necessary to administer the Restricted Stock Award as an award of the Adjusted
Award Consideration), such that following the Effective Time, the Adjusted
Award Consideration shall remain subject to the same vesting, forfeiture and
other restrictions as applied to the Restricted Stock awarded under the
Restricted Stock Award prior to such adjustment.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
(i) to terminate the Equity Compensation Plan effective at or prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) to terminate the 2010 Stock Incentive Plan effective at
or prior to the Effective Time as to any future grant of any equity awards,
and (iii) to terminate all other Company Stock Plans effective at or prior to
the Effective Time that have not previously been terminated.

(e) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Company shall not, at the Effective Time, be
bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, or other rights or agreements
which would entitle any Person, other than Parent and Merger Sub, to own any
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in
respect thereof other than (1) the Stock Option Payment, if any, as described
in Section 2.3(a), (2) the Adjusted Award Consideration, if any, payable in
respect of any Restricted Stock Award, as described in Section 2.3(c), or (3)
any Dissenting Stockholder's, if any, right to receive payment of the fair
value of Dissenting Shares, as described in Section 2.1(e).

disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection of this Agreement to
the extent such disclosure is accompanied by an appropriate cross reference to

SEC Documents, that relates to forward-looking statements to the extent they

Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it
is incorporated and has all requisite corporate power and authority necessary
to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate,
does not have and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean any event, circumstance, change, occurrence or effect that
(i) is materially adverse to, or has a material adverse effect on, the
business, properties, financial condition or results of

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 8-  

  

 

 

 

  

operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole; or (ii)
prevents or materially adversely affects the Company's ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions, excluding
any such event, circumstance, change, occurrence or effect arising out of,
resulting from or attributable to: (A) acts of war or major armed hostilities,
sabotage, or terrorism or any escalation or worsening of any acts of war,
major armed hostilities, sabotage or terrorism; (B) compliance with the terms
of, or the taking of any action required by, this Agreement; (C) changes in
Laws (other than changes that have a disproportionate adverse impact on the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole compared to other businesses
competing in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries do
business) or GAAP (or any interpretation thereof); (D) any change in the price
or trading volume of the Company Common Stock in and of itself (it being
understood that the circumstances underlying such change may be deemed to
constitute, or may be taken into account in determining whether there has
been, a Company Material Adverse Effect); (E) any change in any analyst rating
of the Company in and of itself (it being understood that the circumstances
underlying such change may be deemed to constitute, or may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material Adverse
Effect); (F) the announcement of the Transactions or the taking of any action
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise with the express written consent of
Parent, including the impact thereof on the relationships of the Company or
its Subsidiaries with customers, suppliers, distributors, consultants,
employees or independent contractors or any other Person with whom the Company
or its Subsidiaries has any relationship; (G) changes generally affecting the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate, other than
changes that have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole compared to other businesses competing in such
industries; (H) any change generally affecting the economy, financial or
securities markets or political or economic conditions, or regulatory
conditions (other than changes in regulatory conditions that have a
disproportionate adverse impact on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole compared to other businesses competing in the industries in which the
Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business) in any geographic region in
which the Company and its Subsidiaries conduct business (it being understood
that the circumstances underlying such change may be deemed to constitute, or
may be taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Company
Material Adverse Effect); (I) any failure, in and of itself, by the Company to
meet any internal or published projections, forecasts, or predictions of
revenue, earnings or other financial measure (it being understood that the
circumstances underlying such failure may be deemed to constitute, or may be
taken into account in determining whether there has been, a Company Material
Adverse Effect) and (J) the Company's operations in the ordinary and usual
course of business in compliance with Section 5.1.

  

  

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all Subsidiaries
of the Company together with the jurisdiction of organization of each such
Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable (to the extent such
concepts are applicable) and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company
free and clear of all liens, pledges, charges, mortgages, encumbrances,
adverse rights or claims and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including any restriction on the right to vote or transfer the

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 9-  

  

 

 

 

  

same, except for such transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be
provided under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Act") and the "blue sky"
laws of the various States of the United States (collectively, "Liens")). As
of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any notice or claim, written or oral, challenging the Company's
ownership of the Subsidiaries set forth on Section 3.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, or claiming any ownership interest in such Subsidiaries.
The books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries do not contain any
instrument, certificate, agreement or other document that is inconsistent
with, or that would reasonably tend to call into question, the ownership by
the Company, either directly or indirectly, of all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary set forth
on Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in
Section 3.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock, voting securities or equity
interests in any Person.

  

  

(c) The Company has delivered or made available to Parent correct and complete
copies of its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended (the
"Company Charter Documents"), and correct and complete copies of the
certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) of each of its Subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Organizational
Documents"), in each case as amended to the date of this Agreement. All such
Company Charter Documents and Subsidiary Organizational Documents are in full
force and effect and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
violation of any of their respective provisions in any material respect.

granted under the Equity Compensation Plan), and (iv) no shares of Preferred
Stock were issued or outstanding. All outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Section 3.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list, as of June 3,
2012, of all outstanding Restricted Stock or Options or other rights to
purchase or receive shares of Company Common Stock granted under the Company
Stock Plans, and, for each such Option, share of Restricted Stock or other
right, the Company Stock Plan under which issued, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto, the terms of vesting, the grant and

thereof. No Restricted Stock or Options or other rights to purchase or receive
any shares of Company Common Stock or other equity securities of the Company
are outstanding under any Company Stock Plan, other than the 2010 Stock
Incentive Plan and the Equity Compensation Plan. Since January 1, 2011, (A)
the Company has not declared or paid any

dividend or declared or made any distribution on any of its capital stock, or
directly or indirectly redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired any of its
outstanding capital stock, and (B) the Company has not issued any shares of
its capital stock, voting securities or equity interests, or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of its capital
stock, voting securities or equity interests, other than pursuant to the
exercise of Options issued under the Equity Compensation Plan, except in each
case (i) as set forth above in this Section 3.2(a) or (ii) as otherwise
expressly permitted by Section 5.1 hereof. As of the date of this Agreement
there are not, and as of the Effective Time there will not be, any shares of
capital stock, voting securities or equity interests of the Company issued and
outstanding or any subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible or
exchangeable securities, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
providing for the issuance of any shares of capital stock, voting securities
or equity interests of the Company or representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any Company Common Stock, except in each case (i) as set
forth above in this Section 3.2(a) or (ii) as otherwise expressly permitted by
Section 5.1 hereof.

  

  

(b) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has issued or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, convertible or
exchangeable securities, rights, commitments or agreements of any character
providing for the issuance or disposition of any shares of capital stock,

are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or equity interests (or any options, warrants or other rights to
acquire any shares of capital stock, voting securities or equity interests) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate

consummation by the Company of the Transactions, have been duly authorized and
approved by the Company Board of Directors and except for obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval for adoption of this Agreement, no other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery hereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except that such enforceability (i) may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) is subject to general

and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the Merger, and (iii) resolved to recommend that the stockholders of

constitute a default) under, result in the termination of or a right of
termination or cancellation under, accelerate the performance required by, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any loan or credit agreement, debenture, note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, contract or other
agreement, instrument or obligation (each, a "Contract"), Company License or
Environmental Permit, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or assets are
bound or affected except, in the case of clauses (x) and (y), for such
violations, conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations,
accelerations or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate, do not, or
would not reasonably be expected to, cause a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities; Related Matters.

  

  

(a) The Company has timely filed and furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other statements required to be
filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2009
(collectively, and together with all documents incorporated by reference
therein, but excluding any exhibits filed therewith to the extent the
information set forth therein is not incorporated by reference into such
report, schedule, form, prospectus, registration, proxy or other statement,
the "Company SEC Documents"). None of the Company's Subsidiaries is required
to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that
are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective filing dates (in the case of all
other Company SEC Documents) and if later amended or superseded, then as of
the date of such later filing, the Company SEC Documents complied as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company SEC Documents.

  

  

(b) None of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

  

  

(c) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (i) at the time filed complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements,
as permitted by SEC rules and regulations, including Regulation S-X) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of
which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

  

  

(d) Except as set forth on Section 3.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley
Act"), the Company has been and is in compliance in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. The Company is in compliance in all
material respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules
and regulations of the NASDAQ.

  

  

 

 

 

 

  

 

\- 13-  

  

 

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The management of the Company has established and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Exchange Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is
made known to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of
the Company in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.

  

  

(f) The Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is effective
in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are made in
accordance with the authorization of management, and (iii) regarding
prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the Company's assets that would materially affect the Company's
financial statements. The Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to the Company's auditors and the audit
committee of the Company Board of Directors (i) any significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) any fraud or allegation of fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Company's internal controls over financial
reporting. As of the date hereof, to the Knowledge of the Company, the Company
has not received any complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting
controls or auditing matters, including any such complaint regarding
questionable accounting or auditing matters. To the Knowledge of the Company,
the Company has not identified any currently existing material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations
adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act when due.

  

  

(g) There are no outstanding loans made by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of the Company.

  

  

(h) The date of each Option that is reflected in the Company's books and
records is the actual date of grant thereof (as determined under GAAP). The
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents
fairly reflect in all material respects amounts required to be shown as
expense in connection with the grant and/or amendment of any Option.

  

  

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise,
whether known or unknown) whether or not required, if known, to be reflected
or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in
accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, except liabilities (i) as and to
the extent reflected or reserved against on the audited balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 (the "Company Balance
Sheet" and such date, the "Balance Sheet Date") (including the notes thereto)
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on
March 8, 2012, (ii) incurred after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary
course of business and that are immaterial in amount or significance to the
business, financial condition or results of operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or (iii) that, individually or in the
aggregate, do not have and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 14-  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 3.6 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  

  

Since the Balance Sheet Date, (a) there has not been any event, circumstance,
change, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (b)
the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated their respective businesses in
all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice; (c) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action described in Section 5.1 hereof that if taken after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of Parent would
violate such provision; and (d) there has not occurred any damage, destruction
or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) of any tangible asset of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

  

  

Section 3.7 Legal Proceedings.

  

  

Except as set forth on Section 3.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there
is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, legal,
administrative, arbitral or other proceeding, claim, suit or action against,
or governmental or regulatory investigation of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor is there any injunction, order, judgment, ruling or decree
imposed (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be imposed) upon
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, by or before any Governmental Authority that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Section 3.7 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is currently subject to any settlement agreement or stipulation with respect
to any legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceeding, claim, suit or
action that imposes any material on-going obligation or limitation on the
Company or its Subsidiaries (or their respective assets, properties or

favored treatment under Subchapter B of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code
have received a determination from the IRS that they are so qualified or are
the subject of a favorable opinion letter, and any trusts intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under the Code are so exempt. Nothing has

reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or exemption,
or the imposition of any liability, penalty or tax under ERISA or the Code.

(i) No individual who performs services for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than through a contract with an organization other than
such individual) should be treated as an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for federal income tax purposes who is not in fact so treated for
such purposes.

  

  

(j) All arrangements that would be considered "deferred compensation" for

409A of the Code and all applicable IRS and Treasury Department guidance

providing for the issuance of options to employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) that has been exercised has been properly treated by the
Company as an incentive stock option under Code Section 422 or as a
nonstatutory option, as applicable. All Options granted under any Company Plan
were granted with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of
the Company Common Stock on the date of grant of such Option and no Option has
been amended to reduce the exercise price from that in effect on the date of
grant (except pursuant to non-discretionary antidilution provisions governing
such Option).

complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened to be brought or filed
with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising out of, in
connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination of
employment or failure to employ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, of
any individual. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
Laws relating to the employment of labor, including all such Laws relating to
wages, hours, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and any
similar state or local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" law ("WARN"),

Section 5.2 No Solicitation by the Company.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the valid termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, and shall not authorize or permit its Subsidiaries
or the Company's and its Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,

to engage in or conduct, any existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or cause the
destruction of all copies of confidential information previously provided to
such parties by the Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives. The Company
shall not, and shall not authorize or permit its Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, directly or indirectly:

  

  

(i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including
by way of furnishing non-public information, except as required by applicable
Law) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to, or that constitute,
or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal;

  

  

(ii) participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations with any third
party regarding any Takeover Proposal (other than communications solely
directed at informing such parties of the existence of this Section 5.2 in
response to an inquiry from such third party);

  

  

(iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of
understanding, merger, acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or
other agreement related to any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement in accordance with this Section 5.2(a)) (each, a "Company
Acquisition Agreement"); or

  

  

(iv) release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the
waiver of any provision of or right under, any confidentiality, non-
solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar agreement to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or under which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has any rights;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 38-  

  

 

 

 

  

provided, however, that if after the date hereof and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval) the Company Board of Directors receives a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that was not solicited and was made after the date
hereof in circumstances not involving a breach of this Agreement, and the
Company Board of Directors determines, in good faith, after consulting with
the Company's outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal and determines, in good faith, after consulting with and receiving
the advice of outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would,
or would be reasonably likely to, result in a breach of the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board of Directors to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law, then the Company and/or its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives may, at any time prior to the obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval) and after providing Parent prior or concurrent written notice of its
intention to take such actions, (A) furnish non-public information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover
Proposal, but only after such Person enters into a customary confidentiality
agreement with the Company (which confidentiality agreement must be no less
favorable to the Company (i.e., no less restrictive with respect to the
conduct of such Person) than the Confidentiality Agreement), provided that (1)
such confidentiality agreement may not include any provision calling for an
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company advises
Parent of all such non-public information delivered to such Person
substantially concurrently with its delivery to such Person and substantially
concurrently with its delivery to such Person the Company delivers to Parent
all such non-public information not previously provided to Parent, and (B)
participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person regarding such
Takeover Proposal (including seeking revised Takeover Proposals from such
Person as part of such discussions and negotiations). Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing restrictions
by the Company's Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.2 by the Company. The Company shall provide Parent
with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality agreement entered into
pursuant to this paragraph within 24 hours of the execution thereof.

  

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 5.2, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing,
and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt, if any proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact is received by, any non-public information is
requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated
or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal, and shall,
in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent fully informed
of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company shall provide Parent
with copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such
proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 39-  

  

 

 

 

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.2(c), neither the Company
Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in
clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation
Change"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board of Directors may,
at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (but in no
event after obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval), make a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change if: (1) the Company Board of Directors
determines, in good faith, after taking into account the advice of the
Company's outside legal counsel, that the failure to make the Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would, or would be reasonably likely to, result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law; (2) the Company shall have given
Parent prior written notice (a "Change in Recommendation Notice") advising
Parent of its intention to consider making a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change at least 72 hours prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation
Change; (3) if the decision to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change is
in connection with a Takeover Proposal, (A) the Company shall have provided
Parent with the material terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal,
including the identity of the party making such Takeover Proposal and, if
available, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with such
party and other material documents in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt of such Takeover Proposal or such proposed transaction agreements or
other documents, and (B) after consulting with the Company's outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, the Company Board of Directors shall have
determined, in good faith, that such proposed Takeover Proposal is a Superior
Proposal; (4) the Company shall have given Parent 72 hours after delivery of
the Change in Recommendation Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement (or make another proposal) and shall have negotiated in good faith
with Parent with respect to such proposed revisions or other proposal, if any;
and (5) after considering the results of such negotiations and giving effect
to the proposals made by Parent, if any, (A) after consulting with the
Company's outside legal counsel, the Company Board of Directors shall have
continued to determine, in good, faith, that the failure to make the Company
Adverse Recommendation Change would, or would be reasonably likely to, result
in a breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the
Company's stockholders under applicable Law and (B) if the decision to make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change is in connection with a Takeover
Proposal, after consulting with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisor, the Company Board of Directors shall have continued to
determine, in good faith, that such proposed Takeover Proposal is a Superior
Proposal; provided, that, in the event the Company Board of Directors does not
make the determinations referred to in clause (5) of this Section 5.2(c) but
thereafter determines to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to this Section 5.2(c), the procedures referred to in clauses (2), (3), (4)
and (5) above shall apply anew and shall also apply to any subsequent Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, except that the notice periods referred to in
clauses (2) and (4) shall instead be 48 hours.

  

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 40-  

  

 

 

 

  

(i) "Takeover Proposal" means any proposal, offer or indication of interest
(whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person or "group" (as defined in
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent and its Subsidiaries,
relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more
of the Company's consolidated assets or to which 20% or more of the Company's
revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or
indirect acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company,
(C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
Person or "group"(as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or (D) liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; in each case, other than the Transactions.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written, fully-financed Takeover
Proposal, obtained after the date hereof and not in breach of this Agreement,
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, at least a majority of the equity interests of the Company
or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis, made by a third party, and which is otherwise on
terms and conditions which the Company Board of Directors determines, in its
good faith, (after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and
financial advisor) to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders from a
financial point of view than the Transactions, including the Merger, taking
into account at the time of determination all relevant factors, including any
changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed
by Parent in writing and the ability of the Person making such proposal to
consummate the transactions contemplated by such proposal in a timely manner
(based upon, among other things, the expectation of obtaining required
approvals, including any antitrust clearances, in a timely manner).

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall prohibit the Company Board of Directors
from taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to a Takeover Proposal, if
such Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would, or would be
reasonably likely to, result in a violation of applicable Laws; provided,
however, that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act
shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless, within
two business days of such disclosure, the Company Board of Directors (x)
expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation or (y) rejects such
Takeover Proposal.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.2, the Company
shall not be entitled to enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless
this Agreement has been or concurrently is validly terminated by its terms in
accordance with Article VII.

  

  

 

Section 5.3 Approvals.

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 41-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
(i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to
be satisfied as promptly as practicable and to consummate, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), and (ii) obtain all approvals,
consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from
any Governmental Authority necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, and with respect to any third party approvals those set forth on
Schedule 5.3. Each of the parties shall provide the other parties, upon
request, with copies of all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Authority and, upon request, any other information supplied by such party to a
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, consistent with applicable Laws and the other provisions
of this Agreement. For purposes hereof, "Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, and all other applicable Laws and guidelines
(including any Applicable Foreign Competition Laws) that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of competition
through merger or acquisition.

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 5.3, (i) the parties hereto shall provide or cause to be provided as
promptly as practicable to Governmental Authorities with regulatory
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Laws (a
"Governmental Antitrust Entity") information and documents requested by any
Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary, proper or advisable to permit
consummation of the Transactions, including filing any notification and report
form and related material required under the HSR Act as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement and thereafter to respond
promptly to any request for additional information or documentary material
that may be made under the HSR Act and (ii) if any state takeover statute or
similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.
The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as
are necessary or reasonably advisable to obtain approval of consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Antitrust
Entity or otherwise to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods under the HSR Act. The parties shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve all objections and challenges, if any, that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions
under the Antitrust Laws. Subject to appropriate confidentiality protections,
each party hereto shall furnish to the other

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 42-  

  

 

 

 

  

parties such necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other
party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, nothing in this
Agreement will require or obligate Parent or any of its Affiliates to (and in
no event shall any representation, warranty or covenant of Parent contained in
this Agreement be breached or deemed breached as a result of the failure of
Parent to take any of the following actions): (i) agree to or otherwise become
subject to any limitations on (A) the right of Parent effectively to control
or operate its business (including the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time) or assets (including the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time), or (B) the right of
Parent to exercise full rights of ownership of its business (including the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time) or
assets (including the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time), (ii) agree or be required to sell or otherwise dispose of,
hold (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), or divest itself of
all or any portion of the business, assets or operations of Parent or any of
its Affiliates or the business, assets or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time, or (iii) otherwise take any steps to
avoid or eliminate any impediment that may be asserted under any Law governing
competition, monopolies or restrictive trade practices (including defending
through litigation any claims asserted under the Antitrust Laws by any
Governmental Authority relating to the consummation of the Transactions). In
regard to any Governmental Authority, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall, without Parent's prior written consent in Parent's sole discretion,
discuss or commit to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to
alter any of their businesses or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise
take or commit to take any action that limits Parent's freedom of action with
respect to, or Parent's ability to retain any of the businesses, product or
service lines or assets of, the Company or its Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time or otherwise limits Parent's ability to receive the full
benefits of this Agreement.

  

  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will promptly inform the other party of the
receipt of any material communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any of the Transactions, subject to applicable Law and any
confidentiality restrictions imposed upon such party by such Governmental
Authority with respect to such communications. Subject to applicable Law, the
parties will consult and cooperate with each other in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating
to proceedings under the Antitrust Laws, and shall provide to the Company's or
Parent's outside antitrust counsel, as appropriate, all information and
documents reasonably requested by such counsel promptly upon request, subject
to any reasonable restrictions. The parties hereto may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this Section 5.3 as "outside counsel
only" or "outside antitrust counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient or, in the case of "outside antitrust counsel only," to the outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel or outside antitrust counsel to employees, officers, or directors of
the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from
the source of the materials of Parent and the Company.

  

  

 

Section 5.4 Public Announcements.

  

  

The initial press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement
shall be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither
the Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press
release or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or
made in accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except
(a) as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any securities exchange, as determined by the Company or
Parent, as applicable, in their reasonable discretion, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable efforts
to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b) as otherwise contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 5.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  

  

(a) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent
and Parent's representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours
to all of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts,
commitments, records and correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or
electronic form, and including all material environmentally related audits,
studies, reports, analyses, and results of investigations performed with
respect to the currently or previously owned, leased or operated properties of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives and to all other
information concerning the Company's and its Subsidiaries' business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.

  

  

(b) The Company shall furnish promptly to Parent a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of Federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by the Company from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws.

  

  

(c) Parent and the Company shall hold information received from the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.5 in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated April 12, 2012, between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

  

  

(d) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this Section 5.5
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

  

  

Section 5.6 Notification of Certain Matters.

  

  

The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any notice or other
communication received by the Company from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to
obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 44-  

  

 

 

 

  

Parent, (ii) any material actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in
writing against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that, would cause any
representation or warranty made by the Company contained in this Agreement to
be untrue in any material respect, and (iv) any material failure of the
Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement contemplated
pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the failure to comply with this Section 5.6 will not constitute the
failure of any condition set forth in Article VI to be satisfied unless the
underlying event would independently result in the failure of a such condition
to be so satisfied.

  


 

  

Section 5.7 Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to maintain in effect for not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date,
the Company's current directors' and officers' insurance policies (or policies
of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the current and all former directors and officers of the
Company) with respect to acts or failures to act prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to maintain or obtain policies providing such coverage except to the
extent such coverage can be provided at an annual cost of no greater than 250%
of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof
(the "Cap"); and provided, further, that if equivalent coverage cannot be
obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the
Cap, the Surviving Corporation shall only be required to obtain as much
coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap. The
Company may in lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, following
consultation with Parent, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid
"tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits, and from a carrier or carriers with
comparable credit ratings, as the current directors and officers insurance
policy with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time,
covering, without limitation, the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(b) Following the Effective, Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation for not less than six (6) years after the Closing Date to keep in
effect in the Company Charter Documents all provisions at least as favorable
as the provisions in the Company Charter Documents on the date hereof that
provide for exculpation of director or officer liability and indemnification
(and advancement of expenses related thereto) of the past and present officers
and directors of the Company, except as limited by applicable Law, and such
provisions shall not be amended during such six (6) year period except as
either required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by applicable
Law that would enhance the rights of past or present officers and directors to
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses.

  

  

 

(c) The Persons to whom this Section 5.7 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.7. The provisions of this Section 5.7 are
intended to be for the benefit of each such Person and his or her heirs,
successors and representatives. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 5.7 to the contrary, this Section 5.7 shall survive the consummation
of the Merger and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Parent
and the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 5.8 Securityholder Litigation.

  

  

The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in (but not
control) the defense or settlement of any securityholder litigation against
the Company and/or its directors relating to the Transactions, subject to a
customary joint defense agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parent's prior written consent.

Section 5.9 Fees and Expenses.

  

  

Except as set forth in Section 7.4, all fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the Transactions shall be paid
by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

  

  

Section 5.10 Certain Employee-Related Matters.

  

  

(a) Except to the extent excluded from coverage under a comparable Company
Plan maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a "Prior Company Plan"), for purposes of determining
whether a Continuing Employee has met the eligibility service requirements of
a Parent Benefit Plan and upon each applicable Continuing Employee's
commencement of participation in an applicable Parent Benefit Plan for
purposes of vesting and for purposes of benefit accrual under Parent's
vacation and severance arrangements as in effect on the date hereof, Parent
shall credit each Continuing Employee with his or her years of service (or
applicable portion thereof, as the case may be) with the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates, and any predecessor entities,
to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled to credit for such
service under any Prior Company Plan prior to the Continuing Employee's
commencement of participation in the Parent Benefit Plan, except that
Continuing Employees shall receive no such credit (i) to the extent that such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits, (ii) under any newly-
established Parent Benefit Plan for which similarly-situated employees of
Parent do not receive credited service, or (iii) for purposes of determining
eligibility to receive discretionary contributions to Parent's Employees'
Savings Plan, and (iv) for purposes of determining eligibility under Parent's
Cash Balance Retirement Plan. Parent shall cause any applicable service or
benefit plan provider providing the Parent Benefit Plans that are "group
health plans" (within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code), to the
extent it is lawful and applicable, to waive any pre-existing condition
exclusions or waiting periods for Continuing Employees. Any Parent Benefit
Plan that by its terms, whether specifically or by interpretation, excludes a
Continuing Employee from participation in such Parent Benefit Plan (other than
any such plans with respect to which new participation has been frozen for
Parent employees generally) shall be amended to provide that Continuing
Employees shall participate in any such plan to the same extent as similarly
situated employees of Parent (except (1) as may be prohibited by applicable
Law or (2) to the extent prohibited by the terms of such Parent Benefit Plan
and Parent does not have the discretion to amend, or cause the amendment of,
such terms), and no

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 46-  

  

 

 

 

  

Continuing Employee shall be denied credit for service performed for the
Company, any ERISA Affiliates, and any predecessor entities under any Parent
Benefit Plan to the extent consistent with the other provisions of this
Section 5.10, unless it is contrary to (1) applicable Law or (2) the terms of
such Parent Benefit Plan and Parent does not have the discretion to amend, or
cause the amendment of, such terms. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Continuing Employee" shall mean those individuals employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date who continue their employment
with the Company, Parent or those Subsidiaries that are ERISA Affiliates on
and after the Closing Date, and the term "Parent Benefit Plans" shall mean the
employee benefit plans of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate of
either such entity, other than a defined benefit pension benefit plan. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "ERISA Affiliate" shall include any
organization that is or has ever been treated as a single employer with the
Company or any Subsidiary under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or
Section 4001(b) of ERISA. For the avoidance of doubt, Continuing Employees
shall not receive credit for service prior to the Effective Time for purposes
of benefit accrual under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan.

  

  

(b) Parent shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary to credit
Continuing Employees employed in the United States who elect medical coverage
under Parent's Medical Plan with a contribution to their health reimbursement
accounts for the plan fiscal year that ends December 31, 2012, with the amount
to be determined based on the type of coverage elected according to the
following schedule:

  

  

Individual Employee $350

  

Individual Employee plus one $625

  

Family $950.

  


 

  

(c) If requested in writing by Parent at least five business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the date on which the Company becomes a member of the
same Controlled Group of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the
Code) as Parent (the "Plan Termination Date"), any Company Plan that contains
a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the
Code (a "Company 401(k) Plan"); provided, that pursuant to any such
termination of a Company 401(k) Plan, Parent shall permit rollover
contributions (including outstanding loans) from Company 401(k) Plan
participants into a similar plan of Parent or its Affiliates. If the Company
is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall
provide to Parent prior to the Plan Termination Date written evidence of the
adoption by the Company Board of Directors of resolutions authorizing the
termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to the prior review of Parent). The Company also
shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company
401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request. Any actions taken under this
Section 5.10(c) shall be made contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 47-  

  

 

 

 

  

(d) If requested in writing by Parent at least five business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary, including the provision of notice to all insurance carriers and
third party administrators (provided that Parent has submitted such written
request to the Company prior to the date notice is required by such insurance
carrier or third party administrator), to terminate such Company benefit plans
as requested by Parent, including the Deferred Compensation Plans (and any
related trust agreements or arrangements) with respect to accrual of
additional benefits (but excluding the Company 401(k) Plan, for which Section
5.10(c) shall instead apply) (each, an "Other Company Plan"). Any termination,
early surrender, early withdrawal or other charges incurred as a result of the
termination of an Other Company Plan at such request of Parent shall be paid
for, or reimbursed to the Company, by Parent.

  

  

(e) The Company Board of Directors (or a committee thereof) has adopted
resolutions, and communicated to each executive that is a party to an
employment agreement, stating that it is the Company's intention to have the
executive officer remain employed by the Company for a period of six months
after the execution of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.11 Section 16.

  

  

The Company Board of Directors shall, to the extent necessary, take
appropriate action, prior to or as of the Effective Time, to approve, for
purposes of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the deemed disposition and
cancellation of the Shares and Options in the Merger by applicable
individuals.

respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond to any comments on the Proxy
Statement or requests for additional information from the SEC as soon as
practicable after receipt of any such comments or requests and (ii) cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement. The Company shall promptly
(A) notify Parent upon the receipt of any such comments or requests and (B)
provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand. Prior to responding to any such comments or requests or the filing or
mailing of the Proxy Statement, the Company (x) shall provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any drafts of the Proxy
Statement and related correspondence and filings, (y) shall include in such
drafts, correspondence and filings all comments reasonably proposed by Parent
and, (z) to the extent practicable, the Company and its outside counsel shall
permit Parent and its outside counsel to participate in all communications
with the SEC and its staff (including all meetings and telephone conferences)
relating to the Proxy Statement, this Agreement or any of the Transactions. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any event shall occur, or fact or
information shall be discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment of
or a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company shall, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 5.12(a), prepare and file with the
SEC such amendment or supplement as soon thereafter as is reasonably
practicable and to the extent required by applicable Law, cause such amendment
or supplement to be distributed to the stockholders of the Company.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 48-  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Parent shall provide the Company with information concerning or relating
to Parent or Merger Sub that may be required in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement pursuant to this Section 5.12.

  

  

(c) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the "Company Stockholders
Meeting") solely for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval. Unless the Company's Board of Directors has withdrawn or modified
the Company Board Recommendation so as to constitute a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change to the extent permitted under Section 5.2(c), the Proxy
Statement shall include the Company Board Recommendation. The Company will (i)
take all reasonable actions permitted by applicable law to solicit or cause to
be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this
Agreement and (ii) subject to Section 5.2(c), take all other reasonable action
necessary to secure the Company Stockholder Approval, including, if requested
by Parent, engaging a nationally recognized proxy solicitor reasonably
acceptable to Parent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the Company will
take all of the actions contemplated by this Section 5.12 regardless of
whether a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred and will submit
this Agreement for adoption by the Company stockholders at the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

ARTICLE VIII MISCELLANEOUS

  

  

Section 8.1 No Survival.

  

  

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the representations,
warranties and agreements of each party hereto shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
any other party hereto, any Person controlling any such party or any of their
officers, directors or representatives, whether prior to or after the
execution of this Agreement, and no information provided or made available
shall be deemed to be disclosed in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, except to the extent actually set forth herein or therein. The
representations, warranties and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate
at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, upon
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, as the case may be,
except that the agreements set forth in Article II and Sections 5.7 and any
other agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance after the
Effective Time shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely and the Surviving
Provisions shall survive termination indefinitely. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall (i) survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
its terms and (ii) terminate as of the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 8.2 Amendment or Supplement.

  

  

At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or
supplemented in any and all respects, whether before or after receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by
action taken by their respective Boards of Directors; provided, however, that
following the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company,
there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law
would require further approval by the stockholders of the Company without such
approval.

  

  

 

Section 8.3 Extension of Time, Waiver.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

\- 55-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable
Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any
other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the
other party with any of the agreements contained herein or, except as
otherwise provided herein, waive any of such party's conditions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. No action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party hereto, constitutes a waiver by the party taking such action of
compliance with any provision of this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The waiver
by any party hereto of any provision of this Agreement is effective only in
the instance and only for the purpose that it is given and does not operate
and is not to be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such provision
or as a waiver of any other provision.

  

  

Section 8.4 Assignment.

  

  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or
otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the
other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any
of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent
or to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall
relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under
this Section shall be null and void.

  

  

Section 8.5 Counterparts.

  

  

This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (each of which shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same agreement) and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

Section 8.6 Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

  

  

Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms or provisions hereof are binding
upon or enforceable against any party hereto unless and until the same is
executed by all of the parties hereto. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire
agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) except for the provisions of Section
5.7 (with respect to which the Persons to which such Section 5.7 applies shall
be third party beneficiaries in accordance with Section 5.7), are not intended
to and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies hereunder.
