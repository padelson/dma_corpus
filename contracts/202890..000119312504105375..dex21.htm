a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").



WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_DGCL_ "), Parent, the Company and Merger Sub are hereby agreeing to enter
into a business combination transaction pursuant to which Merger Sub shall
merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ");



WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
(i) approved and adopted this Agreement and declared its advisability and
approved the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (ii) has recommended the adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of

vote to approve the issuance of shares of common stock, par value $.10 per
share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to the terms of the Merger and this Agreement (the " _Share
Issuance_ "); and



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to qualify as
a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the United States
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ");



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: 



ARTICLE I



THE MERGER



SECTION 1.01. _The Merger_. Upon the terms hereof and subject to
the conditions set forth in Article VII, and in accordance with the DGCL, at
the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company. As a
result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").



SECTION 1.02. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between
the Company and Parent, the closing for the merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 2200 Ross Avenue,
Suite 2800, Dallas, Texas, at 9:00 a.m. on the third business day (the "
_Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be satisfied or
waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in
accordance with this Agreement. SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_. As promptly as practicable following the
Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in such form as is required by
the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of such filing of the
Certificate of Merger (or such later time as may be agreed by each of the
parties hereto and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "
_Effective Time_ ").



SECTION 1.04. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of each of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws_.



(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be amended as of the Effective Time to be
and read in its entirety in the form set forth in _Exhibit 1.05(a)_ and, as so
amended, such Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be the Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by law.



(b) At the Effective Time, the By-laws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such By-laws.



SECTION 1.06. _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the
Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and the
initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of the
Company immediately prior to Closing, in each case until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until the earlier of
their death, resignation or removal.



 

ARTICLE II



CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



SECTION 2.01. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:



(a) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share (" _Company Common
Stock_ " and all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ "), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to
be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b)) shall be canceled and shall be
converted automatically, subject to Section 2.02, into the right to receive
0.815 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") shares of Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "), payable upon surrender, in the manner provided in Section
2.02, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share;



 

2 (b) each share of Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and
each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent or of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such cancellation shall be effective if and to the extent that the
Board of the Surviving Corporation determines that such cancellation could
require the recognition of gain for Tax purposes; and

 



(c) each share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.



SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with ChaseMellon
Shareholder Services or such other bank or trust company that may be
designated by Parent and is reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares, for exchange
in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent, certificates
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section
2.01 as of the Effective Time, and cash, from time to time as required to
make payments in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e),
and, if applicable, dividends or other distributions with respect to such
Parent Common Stock (such cash and certificates for shares of Parent Common
Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto,
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the shares of Parent
Common Stock contemplated to be issued pursuant to Section 2.01 out of the
Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 2.02(g) hereof, the Exchange
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable (but no later than five
business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent), and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent
of a



 

3 Certificate for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate (after taking into account all Shares then
held by such holder), cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and
any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled and returned to the Company. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or
other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c) may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Shares is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock,
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to the Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect
to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment
in lieu of any fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws
(as defined in Section 3.05(a)), following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(i) promptly, the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time and paid prior to such surrender with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions, with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment
date occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock.



(d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Stock_. All shares of Parent Common
Stock issued upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c) or (e))
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares.



 

4 (e) _No Fractional Shares_.



(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and
such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or
to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent.



(ii) Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent an amount in cash sufficient
for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of Company Common Stock an amount
in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) such fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all fractional share
interests then held by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the
average of the per share closing prices on the New York Stock Exchange ("
_NYSE_ ") of shares of Parent Common Stock during the ten consecutive trading
days ending on (and including) the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.



(iii) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of the Company Common Stock with respect to any
fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts
to such holders of the Company Common Stock (without interest and subject to
the amount of any withholding taxes as contemplated in Section 2.02(h)).



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Company Common Stock for one year
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of the Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for the shares of Parent
Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to the Parent Common Stock to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c). Any portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a date which is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(g) _No Liability_. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such Shares
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as



 

5 the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be.



(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions
to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).



SECTION 2.03. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares, except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted
into shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e) and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c).



SECTION 2.04. _Company Stock Options_. 



(a) All options (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") outstanding, whether or not
exercisable and whether or not vested, at the Effective Time under the
Commonwealth Industries, Inc. 1995 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and
restated April 23, 1999, the Commonwealth Industries, Inc. 1997 Stock
Incentive Plan, as amended and restated April 23, 1999, (collectively, the "
_Company Stock Option Plans_ "), shall, in accordance with the terms of such
plans, be fully vested upon, and shall remain outstanding following, the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Options shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company
or the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent in such manner that Parent (i) is
a corporation "assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section
424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder or (ii) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code does
not apply to any such Company Stock Options, would be such a corporation were
Section 424 of the Code applicable to such Company Stock Options. From and
after the Effective Time, all references to the Company in the Company Stock
Option Plans and the applicable stock option agreements issued thereunder
shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall have assumed the Company Stock
Option Plans as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and without
any further action. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock
Option (each, a " _Substitute Option_ ") shall be exercisable upon the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the applicable Company Stock
Option Plan and the applicable option agreement issued thereunder immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (A) each such Substitute Option shall
be exercisable for,



 

6 and represent the right to acquire, that whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio; and
(B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock shall be an amount
equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company Stock Option in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by the Exchange Ratio (the exercise price per share, as so determined, being
rounded upward to the nearest full cent).



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and such Substitute
Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including
any antidilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by this
Section 2.04 after giving effect to the Merger). Such notice shall include the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for which such persons Substitute
Options may be exercised and all applicable exercise prices thereunder. Parent
shall comply with the terms of all such Substitute Options and ensure, to the
extent required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Company Stock
Option Plans, that Substitute Options that qualified as incentive stock
options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective Time continue to
qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time. Parent shall take
all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Substitute Options
pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.04. On the date of the
Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Substitute
Options shall be covered by an effective registration statement on Form S-8
(or any successor form) or another appropriate form filed with the SEC, and
Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements for so long as Substitute
Options remain outstanding. In addition, Parent shall use all reasonable
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
Substitute Options to be listed on the NYSE and such other exchanges as
Parent shall determine.



(c) On or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
each of Parent and the Company shall take all necessary action such that, with
respect to each member of the Company Board and each employee and officer of
the Company that is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the acquisition
by such person of Parent Common Stock or Substitute Options in the Merger and
the disposition by any such person of Parent Common Stock or Company
Stock Options pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be exempt from the short-swing profit liability rules of Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated thereunder.



SECTION 2.05. _No Appraisal Rights/Dissenting Shares_. In accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be available to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Except as set forth in the definitive disclosure schedule (denoted in writing
as such) that has been delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior
to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Schedule_ ") or as set forth in (i) the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2003, (ii) the Companys Quarterly Report on

SECTION 3.01. _Corporate Organization_.



(a) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company (each such Subsidiary, a "
_Company Subsidiary_ ") is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
the requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing or
in good standing or to have such power, authority and governmental approvals
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent
or materially delay consummation of the Merger or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transactions_ ") or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed
as a foreign corporation or other entity to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.



(b) A true and complete list of all the Company Subsidiaries, together with
the jurisdiction of organization of each Company Subsidiary and the percentage
interest of each Company Subsidiary owned by the Company and the other Company
Subsidiaries in the aggregate, is set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Other than as set forth in Section 3.01(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not directly or indirectly own any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity.

heretofore made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of
the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws or equivalent organizational

Subsidiary. Such certificates of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent
organizational documents are in full force and effect.



 

8 SECTION 3.03. _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 50,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $.01 per share (" _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of June 16, 2004,

this Section 3.03, and except for the rights (the " _Rights_ ") issued
pursuant to the Stockholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated as of March 6,
1996 (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ "), between the Company and National
City Bank, as rights agent, there are no preemptive or other outstanding
rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights,
redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements, arrangements, calls,
commitments or rights of any character relating to the issued or unissued
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell any shares of capital stock
of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and no securities
or obligation evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding.

and the form of all stock option agreements evidencing such Company Stock
Options. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to issuance as aforesaid,
upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the instruments
pursuant to which they are issuable, shall be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable. Except for the Company Rights Agreement, there
are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of Company
Common Stock or any capital stock of any Company Subsidiary. All outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, all outstanding Company Stock Options, and

or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or

its stockholders on any matter (" _Voting Debt_ ").



 

9 (b) Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and each such share
owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary is owned by such person
free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options,
rights of first refusal, limitations on the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys voting rights, charges and other similar encumbrances of any
nature whatsoever.

SECTION 3.04. _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger, other than
obtaining the Requisite Company Vote (as defined below) and the filing and
recordation of the Certificate of Merger. This Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of general
principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law
or in equity).



SECTION 3.05. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company shall not, (i) conflict with
or violate the certificate of incorporation or by-laws or any equivalent
organizational documents of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (ii)
assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions
described in Section 3.05(b) have been obtained and all filings and
notifications described in Section 3.05(b) have been made, conflict with or
violate any United States or non-United States statute, law, ordinance,
regulation, rule, code, executive order, injunction, judgment, decree or
other order (" _Law_ ") applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected, or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default
(or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or
other encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract,
agreement (oral or written), lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument (" _Contract_ ") or obligation to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any
of their properties or assets is bound or affected, except, with respect to
clauses (ii) and (iii),



 

10 for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences
described in such clauses which would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation
of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company shall not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any United States federal, state, county or local or non-
United States government, governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, instrumentality or commission or any court, tribunal, or
judicial or arbitral body (a " _Governmental Authority_ "), except (i) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, state securities or
"blue sky" laws (" _Blue Sky Laws_ "), the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ "), the competition Laws
of Germany and filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger, and (ii)
where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transactions, or otherwise prevent or materially delay
the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement, and would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 3.06. _Permits; Compliance_. Each of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents,
certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for
each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate
its properties or to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Company
Permits would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise
prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under
this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or
cancellation of any of the Company Permits held by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except
where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of the
Company Permits would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions
or otherwise prevent or materially delay the Company from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in default, breach or
violation of (a) any Law applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound or affected, or (b) any Contract, Company Permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a

expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement and would not

Material Adverse Effect.



 

11 SECTION 3.07. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) The Company has filed all forms, statements, reports and
documents required to be filed or, if permissible, furnished by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since December 31, 2001
(collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). The Company SEC Reports (i)
were prepared in accordance with either the requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), or the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), as the case may be, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. As of its filing date, each Company SEC Report complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and no Company Subsidiary is
required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
_GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly presents, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as
at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated
therein, except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal year-end adjustments of a generally recurring nature).



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the Company SEC Reports filed by
the Company prior to the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued,
absolute, contingent or otherwise), except for (i) their performance
obligations under Contracts existing on the date hereof or under applicable
Law, in each case to the extent arising after the date hereof, (ii)
liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since
the Audit Date and (iii) liabilities and obligations which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially
delay the Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement, and
which in each case would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(d) The Company has timely filed all certifications and statements required by
(i) Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (ii) 18 U.S.C.
Section 1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to
any Company SEC Report and has made such certifications and statements filed
prior to the date hereof available to Parent. The Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15



 

12 under the Exchange Act; such controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that all material information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible
for the preparation of the Companys SEC filings and other public disclosure
documents. Section 3.07(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists, and the
Company has made available to Parent, complete and correct copies of, all
written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other documents
promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures. As used in this Section
3.07, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner in
which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made
available to the SEC.



(e) The management of the Company has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation as of the date of this Agreement, to the Companys outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (i)
all significant deficiencies and all material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) known to the Company as of the date of such
evaluation which are reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involved management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls over
financial reporting.



SECTION 3.08. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2003
(the " _Audit Date_ "), except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only
in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not been
any Company Material Adverse Effect. In addition, since the Audit Date and
through the date hereof, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has:



(a) declared, set aside, made or paid any dividend or other distribution,
payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to any of its
capital stock, except for dividends by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Company Subsidiary to the Company or any other wholly owned Company
Subsidiary;



(b) (i) acquired (including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation, or
acquisition of stock or assets or any other business combination) any
corporation, partnership, other business organization or any division thereof
or, outside the ordinary course of business, any significant amount of assets;
(ii) disposed of (including, without limitation, by sale of assets or stock
or any other transaction) any material portion of its business or assets; or
(iii) incurred any indebtedness for borrowed money or issued any debt
securities or assumed, guaranteed or endorsed, or otherwise become
responsible for, the material obligations of any person other than any wholly
owned Subsidiary, or made any material loans or advances, or granted any
material security interest in any of its assets;



(c) paid, discharged or satisfied any material claim, liability or obligation
(absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise), other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; or



 

13 (d) commenced or settled any material Action.



SECTION 3.09. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no litigation, suit, claim,
action, proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ ") pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, or any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, before any Governmental Authority that (a) has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or (b) as of
the date hereof seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Transactions. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any material
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any
continuing order of, consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar
written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of the Company, continuing
investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority, that
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or
materially delay the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. 



SECTION 3.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all employee
benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") (whether or not such
plan is subject to ERISA, and including any "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")) and all
bonus, stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase, restricted
stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other Contracts,
whether legally enforceable or not, to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party, with respect to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or
sponsored by the Company or any Company Subsidiary for the benefit of any
current or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, (ii) each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary could incur liability under ERISA, and (iii) any Contracts,
arrangements or understandings between the Company or any Company Subsidiary
and any employee or former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
including, without limitation, any Contracts, arrangements or understandings
relating in any way to a sale of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Company Plans_ "). The Company has made
available to Parent a true and complete copy of (i) such Company Plans and all
Contracts relating thereto, or to the funding thereof, including, without
limitation, all trust agreements, insurance contracts, administration
contracts, investment management agreements, subscription and participation
agreements, and record-keeping agreements, each as in effect on the date
hereof, and, in the case of any Company Plan that is not in written form,
Parent has been supplied with an accurate description of such Company Plan as
in effect on the date hereof, (ii) the most recently filed Internal Revenue
Service (" _IRS_ ") Form 5500 for each Company Plan, if any, (iii) the most
recent summary plan description for each Company Plan for which a summary plan
description is required by applicable law, (iv) the most recently received IRS
determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any
Company Plan that is intended



 

14 to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, (v) the most recently prepared
actuarial report or financial statement, if any, relating to a Company Plan
and a current schedule of assets (and the fair market value thereof assuming
liquidation of any asset which is not readily tradable) held with respect to
any funded Company Plan have been made available to Company, and (vi) all
correspondence from the IRS or the Department of Labor received within the
prior three years which relates to a Company Plan. There has been no amendment
to, announcement by the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the level
of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.



Each Company Plan (other than employment or severance agreements) can
be unilaterally terminated or amended by the Company without incurring
material liability thereunder on no more than 90 days notice. No notice has
been received by the Company of an increase or proposed increase in the cost
of a Company Plan. 



(b) None of the Company Plans is a single employer pension plan (within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Company or any entity
(whether or not incorporated) that is treated as a single employer together
with the Company under section 414 of the Code (" _ERISA Affiliate_ ") could,
as of the date hereof, incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a
" _Multiple Employer Plan_ "). To the Companys knowledge, (i) no Company
Multiemployer Plan is the subject of any proceeding brought by the PBGC and
(ii) none of the Company or any Company ERISA Affiliate has received notice
from any Company Multiemployer Plan that it is in reorganization or is
insolvent, that increased contributions may be required to avoid a
reduction in plan benefits or that an excise tax has been imposed, or that
such plan intends to terminate or has terminated, (iii) neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any liability (including any indirect,
contingent or secondary liability) to or on account of a Multiemployer Plan,
pursuant to Section 409, 502(1), 515, 4062, 4063, 4064, 4069, 4201, 4204 or
4212 of ERISA or Section 401(a)(29), 4971 or 4975 of the Code that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect individually or in
the aggregate and no condition exists which presents a material risk to the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring such a liability; and (iv) using
actuarial assumptions and computation methods consistent with Part 1 of
subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA, as of December 31, 2002, the Company and its
ERISA Affiliates have no withdrawal liability under such Multiemployer Plans
in the event of a complete withdrawal therefrom.



None of the Company Plans (i) provides for the payment of
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person,
(ii) obligates the Company or any Company Subsidiary to pay separation,
severance, termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a
result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) obligates
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any
benefit as a result of a "change in control," within the meaning of such term
under Section 280G of the Code. None of the Company Plans provides for or
promises retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary. Each of the Company Plans is subject only to the Laws of
the United States or a political subdivision thereof.



 

15 (c) Each Company Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plans) is operated in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all
applicable Laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code, except
where such non-compliance would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
performed all obligations required to be performed by them under, are not in
default under or in violation of, and have no knowledge of any default or
violation by any party to, any Company Plan. No Action is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Plan (other
than claims for benefits in the ordinary course) that would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no fact or event exists that would give rise to any such Action
that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(d) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has timely received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
covering all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code.



(e) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in or has any
knowledge of a prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Plan unless
such transaction is exempt under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material
liability under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other
than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
arising in the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability
in connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee
benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from
any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.



(f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Company Plan have been made on or before their due dates.

jurisdiction in which the Company or any Company Subsidiary has employed or
employ any person.



SECTION 3.12. _Property and Leases_.



(a) As of the date hereof, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have
sufficient title to all their properties and assets to conduct their
respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such exceptions as

(b) Each parcel of real property together with all buildings and
other structures, facilities or improvements currently or hereafter located

(c) As of the date hereof, the Company or a Company Subsidiary has a valid
leasehold interest in the Real Property leased by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (the



 

18 " _Company Leased Real Property_ " and together with the Company Owned Real
Property, the " _Company Real Property_ "), free and clear of any Liens other
than Permitted Liens or Liens securing monetary obligations disclosed on the
consolidated balance sheets (or notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC
Reports, except for any Liens upon the Company Leased Real Property that do
not materially and adversely affect the current use of the Company Leased Real
Property. Since the date of the last audited balance sheets contained in the
Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, neither the Company nor
the Company Subsidiaries have assigned, transferred, conveyed, mortgaged or
encumbered any of their interests in any Company Leased Real Property. With
respect to each Company Leased Real Property, except as would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the related lease agreement is a valid and binding
agreement of the Company or a Company Subsidiary and is in full force and
effect and (ii) there are no defaults, breaches or events which, with notice
or lapse of time, would constitute a default or breach thereunder attributable
to any action (or failure to act) on the part of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries, or to the Companys knowledge, attributable to any action (or
failure to act) of any other party thereunder.



(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the

and there are no contractual or legal restrictions that preclude or restrict
the ability to use any Company Real Property for the purposes for which it is
currently being used as of the date hereof (or if any exist, such restrictions
have been waived).



SECTION 3.13. _Intellectual Property_.



(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries own, free and clear from
all liens or encumbrances except Permitted Liens, or have legally enforceable
license rights for or otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to all of
the Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of their respective
businesses as presently conducted (" _Company Intellectual Property_ ")
(except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency or other laws affecting creditors rights and other laws of
equity).



(b) Section 3.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all
registered Company Intellectual Property and all Company Intellectual
Property for which there is an application for registration outstanding as of
the date hereof, in each case owned by the Company or a Company Subsidiary
("Company Owned Intellectual Property").



(c) Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses,
sublicenses or other agreements to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third party Intellectual Property that
is material to the conduct of the Companys business as it is currently
conducted.



(d) Section 3.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses,
sublicenses or other agreements as to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is



 

19 a party and pursuant to which any other entity is authorized to use any
Company Owned Intellectual Property that is material to conduct of the
Companys business as it is currently conducted (other than ordinary and
customary user licenses granted to the customers).



(e) All employees of the Company have assigned to the Company inventions and
other Intellectual Property conceived, developed or created in the course
of their employment, except where failures to do so could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.



 

(f) The licenses listed in Section 3.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
are in full force and effect, and there has not been any uncured default in
any obligation to be performed by the Company or a Company Subsidiary under
such licenses. To the knowledge of the Company, no claim has been asserted,
nor are there any claims that could be asserted, alleging that the licenses
that have been granted to the Company or a Company Subsidiary have been
terminated or otherwise diminished.



(g) To the knowledge of the Company, no claims have been made nor have any
proceedings been commenced or threatened that challenge the validity,
enforceability or subsistence of any of the Company Intellectual Property.



(h) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and preserve the trade secrets and
confidential information related to or used in connection with all the Company
Owned Intellectual Property not otherwise protected by patents. 



(i) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received
written notice of, or become aware of, any unauthorized use, disclosure,
infringement, threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation of
any of the Company Owned Intellectual Property by any third party, including
any employee, former employee or independent contractor of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries, in each case any of which would be materially
detrimental to the conduct of the Companys business as currently conducted.



(j) To the knowledge of the Company, the conduct of the business of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as currently conducted, does not
infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property
rights of any third party in a manner that would reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 3.14. _Taxes_.



(a) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have filed any and all United
States federal, state, local and non-United States Tax returns and reports
required to be filed by them and have paid any and all Taxes required to be
paid, other than (i) such payments as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and (ii) such filings or payments that would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All such Tax returns are true, accurate and complete
in all material respects. Neither the IRS nor any other United States or non-
United States taxing authority or agency is asserting or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatening to assert, against the Company or any



 

20 Company Subsidiary any material deficiency or claim for any Taxes or interest
thereon or penalties in connection therewith. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has granted any waiver of any statute of limitations with
respect to, or any extension of a period for the assessment of, any Tax. The
accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in the consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at March 31, 2004
are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable through such date (including
interest and penalties, if any, thereon) in accordance with GAAP. 



(b) There are no Tax liens upon any property or assets of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries except liens for current Taxes not yet due.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has been required to
include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason
of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such
adjustment or change in accounting method, in either case which adjustment or
change could reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution
intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code within the past five years.
To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its affiliates
has taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Transactions
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. The Company is not aware of any agreement, plan or other
circumstance that would prevent the Transactions from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to
any agreement or legal requirement for the sharing of Taxes or is obligated
to indemnify any other person for Taxes pursuant to any agreement or legal
requirement, which agreement or legal requirement shall remain in effect after
the date of Closing. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be
required to recognize income in a taxable period after the date of Closing
that is attributable to any transaction occurring in, or a change in
accounting method made for, a period ending on or prior to the date of
Closing that resulted in a deferred reporting of income from such transaction
or from such change in accounting method.



(d) The Company has determined that an "ownership change" within the meaning
of Section 382 of the Code occurred in the Companys 1995 taxable year and
not in any subsequent tax year of the Company, and that the "annual
limitation" on tax attributes available to the Company resulting from such
ownership change has been properly calculated in the manner specified by
the Code and properly reflected on the Companys Tax Returns.

good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
the requisite power and authority and all necessary governmental approvals
to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it

approvals would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise
prevent or materially delay Parent from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and each
Parent Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation or
other entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction
where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the
nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise
prevent or materially delay Parent from performing its obligations under this
Agreement and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) A true and complete list of all the Parent Subsidiaries, together with the
jurisdiction of organization of each Parent Subsidiary and the
percentage interest of each Parent Subsidiary owned by Parent and the other
Parent Subsidiaries in the aggregate, is set forth in Section 4.01(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule. Other than as set forth in Section 4.01(b) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent does not directly or indirectly own any
equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any equity or similar interest in, any
corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business association or
entity.

heretofore made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of the
certificate of incorporation and the by-laws or equivalent organizational

Such certificates of incorporation, by-laws or equivalent organizational
documents are in full force and effect.

voting rights, charges and other similar encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever.

SECTION 4.04. _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger
Sub, the performance of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part
of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the Merger, other than (i) obtaining the Requisite Parent Vote,
and (ii) with respect to the Transactions, the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger. No action of the shareholders of Parent is required to

This Agreement has been adopted by all necessary corporate and shareholder
action of Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming due authorization, execution
and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject to the effect of
general principles of equity (regardless of whether considered in a
proceeding at law or in equity).



SECTION 4.05. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.



(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
shall not, (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws or any equivalent organizational documents of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
other actions described in Section 4.05(b) have been obtained and all filings
and notifications described in Section 4.05(b) have been made, conflict with
or violate any Law applicable to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or by which
any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is bound or
affected, or (iii) result in any breach of, or constitute a default (or



 

29 an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default)
under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or other encumbrance
on any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary pursuant to, any
Contract or obligation to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party or
by which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets
is bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences described
in such clauses which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub
shall not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or
filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) for
applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, Blue Sky Laws, the HSR
Act, the competition Laws of Germany and filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions, or
otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 4.06. _Permits; Compliance_. Each of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations,
licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates,
approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority necessary for each of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate its properties or
to carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the " _Parent Permits_
"), except where the failure to have any of the Parent Permits would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or
materially delay Parent from performing its obligations under this Agreement
and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of
the Parent Permits held by the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is pending or,
to the knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where the failure to have, or
the suspension or cancellation of, any of the Parent Permits would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the Transactions or otherwise prevent or
materially delay Parent from performing its obligations under this Agreement
and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is in default, breach or violation of (a) any Law applicable to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary is bound or affected, or (b) any Contract, Parent
Permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary is a party or by which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is bound, except for
any such conflicts, defaults, breaches or violations that would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent or
materially delay consummation of the



 

30 Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent from performing
its obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 4.07. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) Parent has filed all forms, statements, reports and documents required to
be filed or, if permissible, furnished by it with the SEC since December
31, 2001 (collectively, the " _Parent SEC Reports_ "). The Parent SEC Reports
(i) were prepared in accordance with either the requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, and (ii) did not, at the time they were
filed, or, if amended, as of the date of such amendment, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As
of its filing date, each Parent SEC Report complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act as the case may be, and no Parent Subsidiary is required to file
any form, report or other document with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.



(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and each fairly
presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and for the respective periods
indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments of a generally recurring
nature).



(c) Except as and to the extent set forth in the Parent SEC Reports filed by
Parent prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has any liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for (i) their performance obligations under
Contracts existing on the date hereof or under applicable Law, in each case to
the extent arising after the date hereof, (ii) liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Audit Date and (iii)
liabilities and obligations which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
Transactions or otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent from performing
its obligations under this Agreement, and which in each case, would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.



(d) Parent has timely filed all certifications and statements required by (i)
Rule 13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (ii) 18 U.S.C. Section
1350 (Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to any
Parent SEC Report and has made such certifications and statements filed prior
to the date hereof available to Parent. Parent maintains disclosure controls
and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act;
such controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material
information concerning Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries is made known on a
timely basis to the individuals



 

31 responsible for the preparation of Parents SEC filings and other public
disclosure documents. Section 4.07(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule
lists, and Parent has made available to the Company, complete and correct
copies of, all written descriptions of, and all policies, manuals and other
documents promulgating, such disclosure controls and procedures. As used in
this Section 4.07, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any
manner in which a document or information is furnished, supplied or otherwise
made available to the SEC.



(e) The management of the Parent has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation as of the date of this Agreement, to the Parents outside
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of the Parent (i)
all significant deficiencies and all material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) known to Parent as of the date of such
evaluation which are reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the
Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involved management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Parents internal controls over
financial reporting.



SECTION 4.08. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since the Audit Date,
except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice and there has not been any Parent Material
Adverse Effect. In addition, since the Audit Date and through the date
hereof, neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has:



(a) declared, set aside, made or paid any dividend or other distribution,
payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to any of its
capital stock, except for dividends by any direct or indirect wholly owned
Parent Subsidiary to the Parent or any other wholly owned Parent Subsidiary;



(b) (i) acquired (including, without limitation, by merger, consolidation, or
acquisition of stock or assets or any other business combination) any
corporation, partnership, other business organization or any division thereof
or, outside the ordinary course of business, any significant amount of assets;
(ii) disposed of (including, without limitation, by sale of assets or stock
or any other transaction) any material portion of its business or assets; or
(iii) incurred any indebtedness for borrowed money or issued any debt
securities or assumed, guaranteed or endorsed, or otherwise become
responsible for, the material obligations of any person other than any wholly
owned Subsidiary, or made any material loans or advances, or granted any
material security interest in any of its assets;



(c) paid, discharged or satisfied any material claim, liability or obligation
(absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise), other
than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; or



(d) commenced or settled any material Action. __



SECTION 4.09. _Absence of Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, or
any property or



 

32 asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, before any Governmental Authority
that (a) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or (b) as of the date hereof seeks to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Transactions. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary nor any material property or asset of Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary is subject to any continuing order of, consent decree, settlement
agreement or other similar written agreement with, or, to the knowledge of
Parent, continuing investigation by, any Governmental Authority, or any order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or award of any
Governmental Authority, that would reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions
or otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent from performing its
obligations under this Agreement or would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 4.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_.



(a) Section 4.10(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists (i) all employee
benefit plans within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (whether or
not such plan is subject to ERISA, and including any Multiemployer Plan), and
all bonus, stock option, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase, restricted
stock, incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other Contracts,
whether legally enforceable or not, to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
is a party, with respect to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has any
obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by Parent or
any Parent Subsidiary for the benefit of any current or former employee,
officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) each employee
benefit plan for which the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary could incur
liability under ERISA, and (iii) any Contracts, arrangements or understandings
between Parent or any Parent Subsidiary and any employee or former employee
of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary including, without limitation, any
Contracts, arrangements or understandings relating in any way to a sale of
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ "). Parent
has made available to the Company a true and complete copy of (i) such Parent
Plans and all Contracts relating thereto, or to the funding thereof,
including, without limitation, all trust agreements, insurance contracts,
administration contracts, investment management agreements, subscription and
participation agreements, and record-keeping agreements, each as in effect on
the date hereof, and, in the case of any Parent Plan that is not in written
form, Company has been supplied with an accurate description of such Parent
Plan as in effect on the date hereof, (ii) the most recently filed IRS Form
5500 for each Parent Plan, if any, (iii) the most recent summary plan
description for each Parent Plan for which a summary plan description
is required by applicable law, (iv) the most recently received IRS
determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Parent
Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code, (v) the
most recently prepared actuarial report or financial statement, if any,
relating to a Parent Plan and a current schedule of assets (and the fair
market value thereof assuming liquidation of any asset which is not readily
tradable) held with respect to any funded Company Plan have been made
available to Company, and (vi) all correspondence from the IRS or the
Department of Labor received within the prior three years which relates to a
Parent Plan. There has been no amendment to, announcement by Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Parent Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for the
most recent fiscal year.



 

33 Each Parent Plan (other than employment and severance agreements) can be
unilaterally terminated or amended by Parent without incurring material
liability thereunder on no more than 90 days notice. No notice has been
received by the Parent of an increase or proposed increase in the cost of a
Parent Plan.



(b) None of the Parent Plans is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple
Employer Plan. None of the Parent Plans (i) provides for the payment of
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any person,
(ii) obligates Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to pay separation, severance,
termination or similar-type benefits solely or partially as a result of any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or (iii) obligates Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to make any payment or provide any benefit as a result of a
"change in control", within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of
the Code. None of the Parent Plans provides for or promises retiree medical,
disability or life insurance benefits to any current or former employee,
officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary. Each of the Parent
Plans is subject only to the Laws of the United States or a political
subdivision thereof.



(c) Each Parent Plan is operated in all material respects in accordance with
its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws, including,
without limitation, ERISA and the Code, except where such non-compliance
would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have performed all obligations required to
be performed by them under, are not in default under or in violation of, and
have no knowledge of any default or violation by any party to, any Company
Plan. No Action is pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened with
respect to any Parent Plan (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary
course) that would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect and, to the knowledge of Parent, no fact or event exists that would
give rise to any such Action that would reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(d) Each Parent Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has timely received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
covering all tax law changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief
Reconciliation Act of 2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable
determination letter within the applicable remedial amendment period under
Section 401(b) of the Code, and Parent is not aware of any circumstances
likely to result in the loss of the qualification of such Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code.



(e) Neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate of Parent has engaged in or has any
knowledge of a prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Parent Plan unless such
transaction is exempt under Section 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has incurred any material liability
under, arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than
liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in
the ordinary course), including, without limitation, any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.



 

34 (f) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Parent Plan have been made on or before their due dates.



SECTION 4.11. _Labor and Employment Matters_.



(a) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Parent from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:



(i) As of the date hereof, there are no ongoing collective bargaining
agreement negotiations which are scheduled to begin prior to the date of the
consummation of the Transactions;



(ii) neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has breached or otherwise
failed to comply with any provision of any collective bargaining agreement or
other labor union Contract, and there are no grievances outstanding against
the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary under any such Contract;

or any Parent Subsidiary before the National Labor Relations Board or to the
knowledge of Parent, any claims concerning representation by a union or
any collective bargaining unit under the National Labor Relations Act
involving employees of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary;



(iv) as of the date hereof, there is no strike, slowdown, work stoppage or
lockout, or, to the knowledge of the Parent, threat thereof, by or with
respect to any employees of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary;



(v) there are no demands, claims or threats of suit by former or current
employees which assert "whistleblower" claims under any Law; and



(vi) there are no government Contracts which subject the Parent to Executive
Order No. 11246 and there are no proceedings or audits underway or known to
be scheduled by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.



The consent of the labor unions which are a party to the collective bargaining
agreements listed in Section 4.11 of the Parent Disclosure Schedule is not
required to consummate the Transactions.



 

35 (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise prevent or materially delay the Parent from performing its
obligations under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect:



(i) the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws relating to the employment of labor, including those related
to wages, hours, collective bargaining and the payment and withholding of
taxes and other sums as required by the appropriate Governmental Authority
and have withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority or are
holding for payment not yet due to such Governmental Authority all amounts
required to be withheld from employees of the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
and are not liable for any arrears of wages, taxes, penalties or other sums
for failure to comply with any of the foregoing;



(ii) neither the Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise
bound by, any consent decree with any Governmental Authority relating to
employees or employment practices;



(iii) there is no charge or proceeding with respect to a violation of any
occupational safety or health standards that has been asserted or is as of the

(iv) there is no charge of discrimination in employment or employment
practices, for any reason, including, without limitation, age, gender, race,
religion or other legally protected category, which has been asserted or is
now pending or threatened before the United States Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, or any other Governmental Authority in any
jurisdiction in which the Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has employed or
employ any person.



SECTION 4.12. _Property and Leases_.



(a) As of the date hereof, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have sufficient
title to all their properties and assets to conduct their
respective businesses as currently conducted, with only such exceptions as
have not had, and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



(b) Each parcel of Real Property owned by Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary (the " _Parent Owned Real Property_ ") (i) is owned free and clear
of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens or Liens securing monetary
obligations disclosed on the consolidated financial statements (or notes
thereto) contained in the Parent SEC Reports, and (ii) is, as of the date
hereof, neither subject to any governmental decree or order to be sold nor is
being condemned, expropriated or otherwise taken by any public authority with
or without payment of compensation therefor, nor, to the knowledge of Parent,
has any such condemnation, expropriation or taking been threatened.



(c) As of the date hereof, Parent or a Parent Subsidiary has a valid leasehold
interest in the Real Property leased by the Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary (the " _Parent Leased Real Property_ " and together with the
Parent Owned Real Property, the " _Parent Real Property_ "), free



 

36 and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens or Liens securing monetary
obligations disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets (or notes thereto)
contained in the Parent SEC Reports, except for any Liens upon the Parent
Leased Real Property that do not materially and adversely affect the current
use of the Parent Leased Real Property. Since the date of the last audited
balance sheets contained in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, neither the Parent nor the Parent Subsidiaries have assigned,
transferred, conveyed, mortgaged or encumbered any of their interests in any
Parent Leased Real Property. With respect to each Parent Leased Real
Property, except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) the related lease
agreement is a valid and binding agreement of the Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary and is in full force and effect and (ii) there are no defaults,
breaches or events which, with notice or lapse of time, would constitute a
default or breach thereunder attributable to any action (or failure to act)
on the part of the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries, or to the Parents
knowledge, attributable to any action (or failure to act) of any other party
thereunder.



(d) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to prevent or materially delay consummation of the Transactions or
otherwise prevent or materially delay Parent from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and there are no
contractual or legal restrictions that preclude or restrict the ability to use
any Parent Real Property for the purposes for which it is currently being used
as of the date hereof (or if any exist, such restrictions have been waived).



SECTION 4.13. _Intellectual Property_. 



(a) The Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries own, free and clear from all liens
or encumbrances except Permitted Liens, or have legally enforceable license
rights for or otherwise possess legally enforceable rights to all of the
Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of their
respective businesses as presently conducted (" _Parent Intellectual
Property_ ") (except to the extent that such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors rights and other
laws of equity). 



(b) Section 4.13(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists all registered
Parent Intellectual Property and all Parent Intellectual Property for which
there is an application for registration outstanding as of the date hereof, in
each case owned by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary (" _Parent
Owned Intellectual Property_ ").



(c) Section 4.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses,
sublicenses or other agreements to which the Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries is authorized to use any third party Intellectual Property that
is material to the conduct of the Parents business as it is currently
conducted.



(d) Section 4.13(d) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists all licenses,
sublicenses or other agreements as to which the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which any other entity is
authorized to use any Parent Owned Intellectual Property that is material to
conduct of the Parents business as it is currently conducted (other than
ordinary and customary user licenses granted to the customers).



 

37 (e) All employees of Parent have assigned to Parent inventions and other
Intellectual Property conceived, developed or created in the course of their
employment, except where such failures to do so could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.



(f) The licenses listed in Section 4.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule are in full force and effect, and there has not been any uncured
default in any obligation to be performed by the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
under such licenses. To the knowledge of Parent, no claim has been asserted,
nor are there any claims that could be asserted, alleging that the licenses
that have been granted to the Parent or a Parent Subsidiary have been
terminated or otherwise diminished.



(g) To the knowledge of the Parent, no claims have been made nor have any
proceedings been commenced or threatened that challenge the
validity, enforceability or subsistence of any of the Parent Intellectual
Property.



(h) The Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries have taken commercially
reasonable and appropriate steps to protect and preserve the trade secrets and
confidential information related to or used in connection with all the Parent
Owned Intellectual Property not otherwise protected by patents.



(i) Neither the Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has received written
notice of, or become aware of, any unauthorized use, disclosure, infringement,
threatened infringement, misappropriation or other violation of any of the
Parent Owned Intellectual Property by any third party, including any employee,
former employee or independent contractor of the Parent or the Parent
Subsidiaries, in each case any of which would be materially detrimental
to the conduct of the Parents business as currently conducted.



(j) To the knowledge of the Parent, the conduct of the business of the Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries, as currently conducted, does not infringe upon,
misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of any
third party in a manner that would reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



SECTION 4.14. _Taxes_.



(a) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have filed any and all United States
federal, state, local and non-United States Tax returns and reports
required to be filed by them and have paid any and all Taxes required to be
paid, other than (i) such payments as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and (ii) such filings or payments that would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All such Tax returns are true, accurate and complete
in all material respects. Neither the IRS nor any other United States or non-
United States taxing authority or agency is asserting or, to the knowledge of
Parent, threatening to assert, against Parent or any Parent Subsidiary any
material deficiency or claim for any Taxes or interest thereon or penalties in
connection



 

38 therewith. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has granted any waiver of
any statute of limitations with respect to, or any extension of a period for
the assessment of, any Tax. The accruals and reserves for Taxes reflected in
the consolidated balance sheet of Parent and the consolidated Parent
Subsidiaries as at March 31, 2004 are adequate to cover all Taxes accruable
through such date (including interest and penalties, if any, thereon) in
accordance with GAAP.



(b) There are no Tax liens upon any property or assets of Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries except liens for current Taxes not yet due.
Neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries has been required to
include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by reason
of a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, and the IRS has not initiated or proposed any such
adjustment or change in accounting method, in either case which adjustment or
change could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has been a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a distribution intended to
qualify under Section 355 of the Code within the past five years. To the
knowledge of Parent, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has taken or
agreed to take any action that would prevent the Transactions from qualifying
as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent
is not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that would prevent
the Transactions from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.



(c) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiaries is subject to any agreement or
legal requirement for the sharing of Taxes or is obligated to indemnify
any other person for Taxes pursuant to any agreement or legal requirement,
which agreement or legal requirement shall remain in effect after the date of
Closing. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary shall be required to
recognize income in a taxable period after the date of Closing that is
attributable to any transaction occurring in, or a change in accounting method
made for, a period ending on or prior to the date of Closing that resulted in
a deferred reporting of income from such transaction or from such change in
accounting method.

with independent legal counsel (who may be Parents regularly engaged
independent legal counsel) that it is required to do so to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to Parent and its stockholders under applicable Law.

(a) Except as required (x) pursuant to any confidentiality agreement
or similar agreement or arrangement to which the Company or Parent or any of

Subsidiaries, nor any of its officers and directors, nor any officers
or directors of its Subsidiaries shall and (ii) each of them shall direct and
use its best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or encourage
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a
merger, reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of its material
Subsidiaries or any purchase or sale of 15% or more of the assets (including,
without limitation, stock of its Subsidiaries) of the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, and its respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for, voting securities of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, that, if consummated, would result in
any person (or the stockholders or other equity owners of such
person) beneficially owning securities representing 15% or more of the total
voting power of the Company or Parent, as the case may be (or of the surviving
parent entity in such transaction) (any such proposal, offer or transaction
(other than a proposal or offer made by the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, or an affiliate thereof) being hereinafter referred to as a "
_Competing Proposal_ ").



(b) The Company and Parent each further agrees that (i) neither it, nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor any of its officers and directors, nor any officers or
directors of its Subsidiaries shall, and (ii) each of them shall direct and
use its best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, agents and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any



 

53 negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to,
or have any discussions with, any person relating to a Competing Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing set forth in this Section 6.04 shall
prevent either the Company or Parent or their respective Boards of Directors
from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations pursuant to the applicable
provisions of, and the rules promulgated under, Sections 14(a), 14(d) or 14(e)
of the Exchange Act with regard to a Competing Proposal; and (ii) at any time
prior to, but not after, the time this Agreement is adopted at the Company
Stockholders Meeting or the Share Issuance is approved at the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, (A) providing information in response to
a request therefor by a person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Competing Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the person
so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement with non-
disclosure obligations and other terms substantially similar to those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement applicable to such party; it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making,
or amendment, of a Competing Proposal publicly made prior to such time; (B)
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Competing Proposal; or (C) recommending such a
Competing Proposal to the stockholders of the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, if and only to the extent that, (x) in each such case referred to in
clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the Board of Directors of the Company or Parent,
as the case may be, determines in good faith after consultation with outside
legal counsel that such action, in light of the Competing Proposal and the
terms of this Agreement, is necessary in order for its directors to comply
with their respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and (y) in each
case referred to in clause (B) or (C) above, the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, is in compliance with this Section 6.04 and the Board of
Directors of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor) that such Competing
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
person making such proposal, and, if consummated, would constitute a Superior
Proposal. The Company and Parent each agrees that it will immediately, and
will request that its Representatives, cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Competing Proposal. The Company and Parent
each agrees that it will take the necessary steps to promptly inform its
Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.04 and under
the Confidentiality Agreements. The Company and Parent each agrees that it
will notify the other promptly (but in any case within 12 hours) if any such
inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers, and thereafter shall keep Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, informed, on a current basis (but in any
case within 12 hours), on the status and terms of any such proposals or offers
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.



(c) Each of the Company and Parent (the " _Subject Party_ ") agrees that (i)
during the five business day period prior to its taking any action referred
to in clause (ii)(C) of the proviso in Section 6.04(b) with respect to a
Competing Proposal, it and its outside legal counsel and financial advisors
shall negotiate in good faith with Parent or the Company, as the case may be
(the " _Proposing Party_ "), and its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement



 

54 proposed by the Proposing Party and (ii) the Subject Party may take any such
action with respect to a Competing Proposal that was a Superior Proposal only
if the Board of Directors of the Subject Party determines in good faith that
such Competing Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal in light of any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to
which the Proposing Party shall have agreed prior to the expiration of such
five business day period. The Subject Party agrees that it will deliver to the
Proposing Party a new notice with respect to each Competing Proposal that
has been materially revised or modified prior to taking any action to
recommend or agreeing to recommend such Competing Proposal to its stockholders
and that a new five business day period shall commence, for purposes of this
Section 6.04(c), with respect to each such revised or modified Competing
Proposal from the time the Proposing Party receives such notice.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that the Company Board or the Parent
Board, as the case may be, complies with Section 6.04(b), nothing in this
section 6.04(c) shall prohibit either such board of directors from making a
Change in Company Recommendation or a Change in Parent Recommendation in
respect of a Competing Proposal that is received ten days or less prior
to the Company Stockholders Meeting or the Parent Stockholders Meeting, as
the case may be, so long as the party making such change in recommendation
provides notice to the other party prior to making such change.



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an
unsolicited bona fide written Competing Proposal which the Board of Directors
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal advisors, taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal and such other matters as such
Board of Directors deems relevant, (i) is more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, from a financial point of view,
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the terms, if
any, proposed by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to amend or modify
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) is
fully financed or reasonably capable of being fully financed and otherwise
reasonably capable of being completed on the terms proposed; _provided_ that,
for purposes of this definition of "Superior Proposal," the term "Competing
Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section 6.04(a),
except that the reference to "15% or more" in the definition of "Competing
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "a majority" and the
shareholders of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, would own less than
50% of the equity interests having general voting power under ordinary
circumstances to elect directors of the combined entities following
consummation of the Competing Proposal.



SECTION 6.05. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification._



(a) Parent agrees that, commencing at and from and after the Effective Time,
it will indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and
officer of the Company (acting in such capacity) and each present and former
director and officer of any Company Subsidiary who is or was serving in such
capacity at the request of the Company, in each case determined as of the
Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest



 

55 extent permitted by Law (and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under Law,  _provided_ that the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an officers or directors conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Delaware law and the Companys certificate of
incorporation and by-laws shall be made by independent counsel (in accordance
with Section 145(d) of the DGCL) agreed to by the director or officer and by
the Parent.



(b) Unless the Company has prior to the Closing obtained one or more "tail"
insurance policies described in the following sentence, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the current
directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies with coverage no less advantageous to the insured than the policies
in place immediately prior to the Effective Time) with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
Section 6.05(b) more than $1,600,000 per year, but if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
be required to spend up to $1,600,000 per year for such insurance to acquire
as much insurance as may be obtained. The provisions of this Section 6.05(b)
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if the Company shall have obtained
prepaid policies prior to the Closing, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage no less advantageous to the insured than the
policies in place immediately prior to the Effective Time for an aggregate
period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that
occurred on or before the Effective Time (including those related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).



(c) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or, in the case of successors
of the Surviving Corporation, at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.05.



SECTION 6.06. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event or
circumstance, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause the
conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) to be incapable of
satisfaction. Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of the occurrence
or non-occurrence of any event or circumstance, the occurrence or non
occurrence of which would cause the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a)
or 7.03(b) to be incapable of satisfaction.



SECTION 6.07. _Company Affiliates_. Prior to the date of mailing of the Proxy
Statement to its stockholders, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of
names and addresses of those persons who the Company determines in good faith
were, in the Companys reasonable judgment, as of the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, affiliates (within



 

56 the meaning of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations promulgated under the
Securities Act) of the Company. The Company shall provide Parent with such
information and documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of
reviewing such list. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the Effective Time, an
affiliate letter in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 6.07_ , executed by
each person who was an affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 145 of the rules
and regulations promulgated under the Securities Act) of the Company at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting.



SECTION 6.08.  _Further Action; Reasonable Best Efforts_. __



(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall
(i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, under the HSR Act and under any applicable antitrust or
competition Law of any foreign Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
with respect to the Merger and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise
to consummate and make effective the Merger, including, without limitation,
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and
other third party consents, approvals and authorizations as are necessary for
the consummation of the Merger and the Transactions and to fulfill the
conditions to the Merger (which, in the case of the Company, shall exclude
those conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a) or (b) and, in the case of
Parent, shall exclude those conditions set forth in Section 7.02(a) or (b)).



(b) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.08, each of the Company and Parent agrees to take or cause to be
taken the following actions: (i) the prompt provision to each and every
federal, state, local or foreign Governmental Authority having jurisdiction
over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition Laws ("
_Government Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-privileged information and documents
requested by any Government Antitrust Entity; (ii) the prompt use of its
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or
judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, the defense through
litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any person or entity, including, without limitation, any
Governmental Authority, seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or
otherwise prohibit consummation of such transactions and the proffer and
agreement of its willingness to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, disposal
and holding separate of, such assets, categories of assets or businesses or
other segments of the Company or Parent or eithers respective Subsidiaries
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) no later than 60 days from
the date hereof if such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of any order,
decree, decision, determination or judgment that would materially delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger by
any Government Antitrust Entity; and (iii) the prompt use of its reasonable
best efforts to take, in the event that any permanent, preliminary or
temporary injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is
entered or issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued,
in any proceeding



 

57 or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger,
any and all steps (including, without limitation, the appeal thereof, the
posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by clause (ii)
of this Section 6.08(b)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,
suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to permit
such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by
this Agreement.



(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 6.08 to the contrary,
Section 6.08(b) shall not be deemed to require either Parent or the Company or
any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to take or agree to take any Action
of Divestiture with respect to their respective assets which would be
materially adverse to the business, financial condition, assets or results of
operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole following the
Merger (excluding the loss of any cost savings or revenue enhancements
expected as a result of the Merger and the consolidated operations of Parent,
the Company and their Subsidiaries thereafter). For purposes of this
Agreement, an " _Action of Divestiture_ " shall mean making proposals,
executing or carrying out agreements providing for the license, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise) of any assets or categories of assets that are material to
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or the holding
separate of capital stock of the Company, or imposing or seeking to impose any
limitation on the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, to conduct their respective businesses or own such assets or to
acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of the business of the
Company.

taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken which
action or failure to act could prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Following the
Effective Time, neither the Surviving Corporation, Parent nor any of their
affiliates shall knowingly take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail
to take any action or cause any action to fail to be taken, which action or
failure to act could cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.



(b) As of the date hereof, the Company does not know of any reason (i) why it
would not be able to deliver to counsel to the Company and Parent, at each of
the date of the Registration Statement referred to above and the date of the
legal opinions referred to below, certificates substantially in compliance
with IRS published advance ruling guidelines, with customary exceptions and
modifications thereto, to enable such firms to deliver the legal

Executive Officer of Parent and shall not be permitted to make any
appointment or reporting decision unless such appointment or reporting
decision shall have been recommended in good faith by Steven Demetriou. The
committees shall be disbanded at the Effective Time.



SECTION 6.15. _Employee Benefits._



(a) Parent agrees that it shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain all Company Plans that are welfare benefit plans for those
individuals who as of the Effective Time were employees of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries (other than collectively bargained employees) (the
" _Affected Employees_ "), in accordance with the terms of such Company Plans
as in effect immediately before the Effective Time, without amendment, other
than amendments that do not decrease benefits for participants or that are
required by Law, for a period from the Effective Time through at least
January 1, 2006.



(b) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Affected Employees after the Effective
Time (the "New Plans"), each Affected Employee shall receive credit for his
or her service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries before the
Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have given credit
for prior service) for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not (i) for
purposes of eligibility for subsidized early retirement benefits, (ii) for
purposes of benefit accrual under defined benefit pension plans and (iii) for
any new program for which credit for benefit accrual for service prior to the
effective date of such program is not given to similarly situated employees of
Parent and



 

61 the Parent Subsidiaries other than the Affected Employees) to the same extent
as such Affected Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under a Company Plan (except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) at the Effective Time, each
Affected Employee immediately shall be eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in
which such Affected Employee participated immediately before the Effective
Time (such plans, collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of
each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits
to any Affected Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such Affected Employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent such
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements were
inapplicable to or had been satisfied by such Affected Employee and his or her
covered dependents immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant
Old Plan, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Plan.



(c) With respect to matters described in this Section 6.15 relating to
benefits or compensation to be provided after the Effective Time, the Company
will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide Parent prior to
delivery with copies of any broad-based notices or other communication
materials of a general nature to be delivered prior to the Effective Time.



SECTION 6.16. _Financing_.



(a) Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to,
cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to complete a financing or
financings (the " _Financing_ "), which provides funds immediately following
the Effective Time that are in an amount that is sufficient to (i) fully
redeem the Companys 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2006 together with
accrued and unpaid interest thereon and (ii) refinance in full (A) the
Companys existing accounts receivables financing and credit facilities in the
amounts outstanding immediately prior to the Closing and (B)
Parents existing credit facilities in the amounts outstanding immediately
prior to the Closing (the sum of such amounts, being referred to as the
"Financing Amount").



(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall use their reasonable
best efforts to obtain a letter from the person or persons providing the
Financing or from the person or persons leading any group of persons providing
the Financing indicating that immediately following the Effective Time, funds
in an amount equal to the Financing Amount shall be available to Parent or
its Subsidiaries without any condition other than the occurrence of the
Effective Time (the " _Financing Letter_ ").

76 SECTION 9.04. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Merger is not affected in any manner materially adverse to
any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the
fullest extent possible.



SECTION 9.05. _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersedes, except as set forth in Section 6.03(b), all prior agreements
and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be
assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise).



SECTION 9.06. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than Section 6.05 (which is intended to be for
the benefit of the persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such
persons). 



SECTION 9.07. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties
shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to
any other remedy at law or equity.



SECTION 9.08. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
contracts executed in and to be performed in that State (other than those
provisions set forth herein that are required to be governed by the DGCL).
All actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall
be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Chancery Court. The
parties hereto hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Delaware Chancery Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or
relating to this Agreement brought by any party hereto, and (b) irrevocably
waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or otherwise, in any
such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction
of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum,
that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this Agreement or the
Merger may not be enforced in or by any of the above-named courts.



SECTION 9.09. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Merger. Each of the
parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative,



 

77 agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
that foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have
been induced to enter into this Agreement and the Merger, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.09.



SECTION 9.10. _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this
Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect
in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



SECTION 9.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.



 

78 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
