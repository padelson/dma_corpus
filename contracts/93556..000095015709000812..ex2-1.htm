AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of November 2,
2009, among THE BLACK and DECKER CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation ("Black and
Decker"), THE STANLEY WORKS, a Connecticut corporation ("Stanley"), and
BLUE JAY ACQUISITION CORP., a Maryland corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Stanley ("Merger Sub").

 

 

WHEREAS each of the Board of Directors of Black and Decker, the Board of
Directors of Stanley and the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has approved
this Agreement and determined that the Merger on the terms provided for in
this Agreement is advisable and in the best interests of Black and Decker,
Stanley or Merger Sub, as applicable, and its respective stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable;

 

 

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of Black and Decker and the Board of Directors
of Merger Sub each has recommended that its stockholders approve the Merger
on the terms provided in this Agreement, and the Board of Directors of
Stanley has adopted the Articles Amendment and recommended that its
shareholders approve the Share Issuance and the Articles Amendment on the
terms provided in this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code (the "Intended Tax Treatment"), and this Agreement is intended to be,
and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354
and 361 of the Code;

 

 

WHEREAS as an inducement to Stanley and Merger Sub to enter into this
Agreement, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Nolan D. Archibald is entering into an employment agreement with Stanley (the
"Executive Chairman Agreement"), conditioned upon consummation of the Merger
and to be effective at the Effective Time; and

 

 

WHEREAS Black and Decker, Stanley and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

 

The Merger

 

 

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Maryland General
Corporation Law (the "MGCL"), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Black and Decker (the "Merger"). At the Effective Time
and as a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease and Black and Decker shall continue as the surviving company in the
Merger (the "Surviving Company").

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger shall take
place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825
Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on
a date to be specified by Black and Decker and Stanley, which shall be no later
than the second Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed
in writing between Black and Decker and Stanley; provided, however, that if
all the conditions set forth in Article VII shall not have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted by Law) waived on such second Business Day, then the
Closing shall take place on the first Business Day thereafter on which all
such conditions shall have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

 

 

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland (the
"SDAT") the articles of merger relating to the Merger (the "Articles of
Merger"), executed and acknowledged in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the MGCL, and, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date, shall make all other filings required under the MGCL or by the SDAT in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time
that the Articles of Merger have been duly filed with and accepted for record
by the SDAT, or at such later time, not more than 30 days after the Articles
of Merger are accepted for record by the SDAT, as Black and Decker, Stanley and
Merger Sub shall agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

 

 

SECTION 1.04. Effects. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the MGCL.

 

 

SECTION 1.05. Charter and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the charter of Black
and Decker shall be amended and restated in its entirety as set forth on
Exhibit A hereto and shall be the charter of the Surviving Company until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The
bylaws of the Surviving Company in effect from and after the Effective Time
and until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law shall be in the form of the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that references to the name of Merger Sub
shall be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company (the
"Surviving Company Bylaws").

 

 

SECTION 1.06. Board of Directors and Officers of Surviving Company. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become
the directors of the Surviving Company as of the Effective Time until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or their respective successors have
been duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of Black and
Decker immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue as the officers
of the Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly appointed and qualified.

ARTICLE II

 

 

Effect on the Stock of the

 

Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates

 

 

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Black and Decker, Stanley, Merger Sub or
the holder of any shares of Black and Decker Common Stock or any shares of
Merger Sub Common Stock:

 

 

(a) Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Company with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of stock of the Surviving Company. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock, if any, shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

 

(b) Cancellation of Stanley-Owned Stock. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.50 per share, of Black and Decker (the "Black and Decker Common Stock")
that is owned by Stanley or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 

 

(c) Conversion of Black and Decker Common Stock. Subject to Sections 2.01(b)
and 2.02(f), each share of Black and Decker Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive 1.275 (the "Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Stanley Common Stock, together with associated Stanley Rights (the
"Merger Consideration"). All such shares of Black and Decker Common Stock,
when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Black and Decker Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") and each holder of
shares of Black and Decker Common Stock held in book-entry form shall, in each
case, cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Stanley Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any
dividends or other distributions to which holders become entitled
in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Stanley Common Stock" means the common stock, par value $2.50 per
share, of Stanley. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Stanley
Common Stock or Black and Decker Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any
number or amount contained herein which is based upon the number of shares of
Stanley Common Stock or Black and Decker Common Stock, as the case may be, will
be appropriately adjusted to provide to Stanley and the holders of Black
and Decker Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event. The right of any holder of Black and
Decker Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject in
all cases to the provisions of Section 2.02, and in accordance therewith
shall be subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding under
applicable Tax Law.

SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates; Book-Entry Shares. (a)
Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Stanley shall appoint a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to Black and Decker to act as exchange
agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Stanley shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Black and Decker Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II through the Exchange Agent,
certificates representing the shares of Stanley Common Stock to be issued as
Merger Consideration and cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such shares of Stanley
Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund".

 

 

(b) Letter of Transmittal. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, and in any event not later than the second Business Day
thereafter, Stanley shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
record of Black and Decker Common Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the
"Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to any Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of such Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as Stanley may specify subject to Black and Decker's
reasonable approval), together with instructions thereto.

 

 

(c) Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange. Upon (i) in
the case of shares of Black and Decker Common Stock represented by a
Certificate, the surrender of such Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, or (ii) in the case of shares of Black and Decker Common Stock
held in book-entry form, the receipt of an "agent's message" by the Exchange
Agent, in each case together with the associated Letter of Transmittal, duly,
completely and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Black and Decker Common
Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01 and (ii) any cash in lieu
of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
2.02(f) and any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the
right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Black and Decker Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of Black and Decker, a certificate representing the proper
number of shares of Stanley Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in
lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive pursuant
to Section 2.02(f) and any dividends or other distributions which the holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Black and Decker Common Stock
(or, if such Black and Decker Common Stock is held in book-entry form, proper
evidence of such transfer) is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share of Black and Decker
Common Stock, and any Certificate with respect thereto shall be deemed at any
time from and after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive
upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of
Black and Decker Common Stock were entitled to receive in respect of such

  (d) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Stanley Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate (or shares of Black and Decker Common Stock held in book-entry
form) with respect to the shares of Stanley Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender of
such Certificate (or such shares of Black and Decker Common Stock held in book-
entry form) in accordance with this Article II. Subject to escheat, Tax or
other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate (or shares
of Black and Decker Common Stock held in book-entry form), there shall be paid
to the holder of the certificate representing whole shares of Stanley Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Stanley Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Stanley Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective

Decker Common Stock held in book-entry form) in accordance with the terms of
this Article II shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Black and Decker Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificates (or shares of Black and Decker
Common Stock held in book-entry form), subject, however, to the Surviving
Company's obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions
with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or
made by Black and Decker on such shares of Black and Decker Common Stock and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Company of shares of Black and Decker Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the

Decker Common Stock (or shares of Black and Decker Common Stock held in book-

(f) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Stanley Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Black and Decker Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a holder of Stanley Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of Black and Decker Common
Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who, based on the Exchange Ratio,
would have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Stanley Common
Stock (after taking into account all shares of Black and Decker Common Stock
exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional amount multiplied by the
closing sale price for Stanley Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange
(the "NYSE") (as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Stanley and
Black and Decker) for the trading day immediately preceding the date of the
Effective Time.

 

 

(g) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
any interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the
holders of Black and Decker Common Stock for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Stanley, upon demand, and any holder of Black and Decker
Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Stanley for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Article II.

 

 

(h) No Liability. None of Black and Decker, Stanley, Merger Sub or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion
of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates for two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund otherwise would be required to
escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Stanley, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

 

(i) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Stanley. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Stanley.

 

 

  (j) Withholding Rights. Each of Stanley and the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Black and Decker Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable
Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Black and Decker Common Stock in respect of
which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

 

(k) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Stanley, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Stanley may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
and any dividends and distributions on the Certificate deliverable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Article II.

or forward-looking in nature) or in the disclosure letter delivered by
Stanley to Black and Decker at or before the execution and delivery by Stanley
and Merger Sub of this Agreement (the "Stanley Disclosure Letter"). The

  SECTION 3.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Stanley and each
of Stanley's Subsidiaries (the "Stanley Subsidiaries") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such
jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the Stanley
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Stanley Material Adverse Effect. Each of
Stanley and the Stanley Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority
and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits, authorizations,
variances, exemptions, orders and approvals (collectively, "Permits")
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and
assets and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted (the "Stanley

possess Stanley Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Stanley Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Stanley and the Stanley Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary,
other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Stanley Material Adverse Effect. Stanley
has delivered or made available to Black and Decker, prior to execution of
this Agreement, true and complete copies of (a) the certificate of
incorporation of Stanley in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Stanley Articles") and the bylaws of Stanley in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the "Stanley Bylaws") and (b) the articles of incorporation

and directing that the Articles Amendment and the Share Issuance be submitted
to Stanley's shareholders for approval at a duly held meeting of such

Agreement. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has adopted resolutions, by

Shareholder Approval"), (B) solely in the case of the Articles Amendment, for
the approval of the Articles Amendment by the affirmative vote of holders of
a number of shares of Stanley Common Stock represented in person or by proxy
at the Stanley Shareholder Meeting in excess of the number of shares of
Stanley Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the Stanley
Shareholder Meeting held by holders casting a negative vote (the "Stanley
Articles Amendment Approval") and (C) solely in the case of the Merger, for
the approval of the Merger by Stanley as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Stanley or Merger Sub are
necessary to authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (except for the execution and filing of the appropriate merger

Merger Consideration. No other "interested shareholder", "fair price",
"moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar antitakeover

Stanley Articles or Stanley Bylaws, applies with respect to Stanley or Merger
Sub with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets (assuming that the
Stanley Shareholder Approval is obtained), other than, in the case of clauses

respects the consolidated financial position of Stanley and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their

(c) Neither Stanley nor any Stanley Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or
otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Stanley Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(d) Each of the chief executive officer of Stanley and the chief financial
officer of Stanley (or each former chief executive officer of Stanley and
each former chief financial officer of Stanley, as applicable) has made all

forth in the Black and Decker SEC Documents filed and publicly available prior
to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed Black and Decker SEC Documents")
(excluding any disclosures in the Filed Black and Decker SEC Documents under

predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in the disclosure letter
delivered by Black and Decker to Stanley at or before the execution and
delivery by Black and Decker of this Agreement (the "Black and Decker Disclosure
Letter"). The Black and Decker Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in numbered
and lettered sections corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
contained in this Article IV, and the disclosure in any section shall be

sections.

 

 

  SECTION 4.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Black and Decker and
each of Black and Decker's Subsidiaries (the "Black and Decker Subsidiaries") is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the
extent such jurisdiction recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the
Black and Decker Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so organized, existing
or in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Black and Decker Material Adverse Effect.
Each of Black and Decker and the Black and Decker Subsidiaries has all requisite
power and authority and possesses all Permits necessary to enable it to own,
lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its
businesses as presently conducted (the "Black and Decker Permits"), except

Decker Permits, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Black and Decker Material Adverse Effect. Each
of Black and Decker and the Black and Decker Subsidiaries is duly qualified or
licensed to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business
or the ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Black and Decker Material Adverse
Effect. Black and Decker has delivered or made available to Stanley, prior to

vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or
other equity interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable
securities Laws. Black and Decker has provided to Stanley a true and complete

Option was duly authorized no later than the Grant Date for such option by
all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the
Board of Directors of Black and Decker (the "Black and Decker Board") (or a duly
constituted and authorized committee thereof), and the award agreement
governing such grant was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto,

and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Black and Decker are reasonably
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Black and Decker in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and

and that all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and

and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off-

published financial statements or other Black and Decker SEC Documents.

SECTION 5.02. No Solicitation by Stanley; Stanley Board Recommendation. (a)
Stanley shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or
any of its or their respective directors, officers or employees or any of its
or their respective investment bankers, accountants, attorneys or other
advisors, agents or representatives (collectively, "Representatives")
to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage,
induce or facilitate any Stanley Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Stanley Takeover Proposal
or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, any Stanley Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or
proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Stanley Takeover
Proposal. Stanley shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any Stanley Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Stanley Takeover Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished in connection therewith and immediately terminate all
physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person
or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Stanley Shareholder Approval and the Stanley Articles Amendment
Approval, in response to a written Stanley Takeover Proposal that the Stanley
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Stanley Proposal, and which Stanley
Takeover Proposal was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
otherwise result from a breach of the non-solicitation provisions of this
Section 5.02(a), Stanley may (and may authorize and permit its Affiliates and
its and their Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section
5.02(c), (A) furnish information with respect to Stanley and the Stanley
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Stanley Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) (provided that all such information has previously been
provided to Black and Decker or is provided to Black and Decker prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of
such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement (other than with respect to
standstill provisions), and (B) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such Stanley Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms
with, and only with, the Person making such Stanley Takeover Proposal (and
such Person's Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.02(a) by
any Representative of Stanley or any of its Affiliates shall constitute a
breach of this Section 5.02(a) by Stanley.

 

 

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Stanley Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to Black and
Decker), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Black and Decker), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability
by the Stanley Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this
Agreement, including the Articles Amendment and the Share Issuance, or (B)
adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt,
recommend or declare advisable, any Stanley Takeover Proposal (any action in
this clause (i) being referred to as a "Stanley Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (ii) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly
to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or allow Stanley or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, alliance agreement,
partnership agreement or other similar agreement or arrangement
(an "Acquisition Agreement") constituting or related to, or that is intended
to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Stanley Takeover Proposal,
or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Stanley or Merger Sub to
abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would otherwise
impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, Stanley or Merger Sub to fail to comply with
this Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.02(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Stanley Shareholder Approval and the Stanley Articles Amendment Approval, the
Stanley Board may make a Stanley Adverse Recommendation Change if Stanley
receives a Superior Stanley Proposal or the Stanley Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that
Stanley shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Stanley
Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business Day following
Black and Decker's receipt of written notice (a "Stanley Notice
of Recommendation Change") from Stanley advising Black and Decker that
the Stanley Board intends to take such action and specifying the reasons
therefor, including in the case of a Superior Stanley Proposal the terms and
conditions of such Superior Stanley Proposal that is the basis of the
proposed action by the Stanley Board (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of such Superior Stanley Proposal shall
require a new Stanley Notice of Recommendation Change and a new five Business
Day period). In determining whether to make a Stanley Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Stanley Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of
this Agreement proposed by Black and Decker in response to a Stanley Notice of
Recommendation Change or otherwise.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Stanley set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 5.02, Stanley shall promptly advise Black and Decker orally
and in writing of any Stanley Takeover Proposal, the material terms and
conditions of any such Stanley Takeover Proposal (including any changes
thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such Stanley
Takeover Proposal. Stanley shall (i) keep Black and Decker informed in all
material respects of the status and details (including any change to
the terms thereof) of any Stanley Takeover Proposal, and (ii) provide to
Black and Decker as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of all correspondence and other written material exchanged between
Stanley or any of its Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the
terms or conditions of any Stanley Takeover Proposal.

 

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit Stanley from (i)
issuing a "stop-look-and-listen communication" pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its
shareholders positions required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, in each case after the commencement of a tender offer
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), (ii)
issuing a statement in connection with a Stanley Takeover Proposal that does
not involve the commencement of a tender offer (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act), so long as the statement includes
no more information than would be required for a "stop-look-and-listen
communication" under Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act if such
provision was applicable, or (iii) making any disclosure to the shareholders
of Stanley if, in the good faith judgment of the Stanley Board (after
consultation with outside counsel) failure to so disclose would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that
in no event shall Stanley or the Stanley Board or any committee thereof take,
or agree or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 5.02(b).

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

 

"Stanley Takeover Proposal" means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing), with respect to any (i) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination or similar transaction involving Stanley, (ii)
sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, other business
combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or other
equity interests in a Stanley Subsidiary or otherwise) of any business or
assets of Stanley or the Stanley Subsidiaries representing 10% or more of the
consolidated revenues, net income or assets of Stanley and the Stanley
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other disposition,
directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) or
group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for, such securities)
representing 10% or more of the voting power of Stanley, (iv) transaction in
which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly
or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially owns or has the right
to acquire beneficial ownership of, 10% or more of the Stanley Common Stock
or (v) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the
Merger).

 

 

"Superior Stanley Proposal" means any binding bona fide written offer made by
a third party or group pursuant to which such third party (or, in a merger,
consolidation or statutory share exchange involving such third party, the
stockholders of such third party) or group would acquire, directly or
indirectly, more than 50% of the Stanley Common Stock or substantially all of
the assets of Stanley and the Stanley Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which
the Stanley Board determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) is (i)
on terms more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of
Stanley Common Stock than the Merger, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes
proposed by Black and Decker to the terms of this Agreement), and (ii)
reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

 

 

SECTION 5.03. No Solicitation by Black and Decker; Black and Decker
Board Recommendation. (a) Black and Decker shall not, nor shall it authorize
or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its or their respective
Representatives to, (i) directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage, induce or facilitate any Black and Decker Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Black and
Decker Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding, or furnish to any
Person any information with respect to, any Black and Decker Takeover Proposal
or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Black
and Decker Takeover Proposal. Black and Decker shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Person conducted heretofore with respect to any Black and Decker Takeover
Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead
to a Black and Decker Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in
connection therewith and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Black and
Decker Stockholder Approval, in response to a written Black and Decker Takeover
Proposal that the Black and Decker Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Superior Black and Decker Proposal, and which Black and Decker Takeover Proposal
was made after the date of this Agreement and did not otherwise result from a
breach of the non-solicitation provisions of this Section 5.03(a), Black and
Decker may (and may authorize and permit its Affiliates and its and their
Representatives to), subject to compliance with Section 5.03(c), (A) furnish
information with respect to Black and Decker and the Black and Decker
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Black and Decker Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) (provided that all such information has previously been
provided to Stanley or is provided to Stanley prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of such Person than
the Confidentiality Agreement (other than with respect to standstill
provisions), and (B) participate in discussions regarding the terms of such
Black and Decker Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with, and
only with, the Person making such Black and Decker Takeover Proposal (and such
Person's Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed
that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03(a) by
any Representative of Black and Decker or any of its Affiliates shall
constitute a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by Black and Decker.

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the Black and Decker Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Stanley), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify in any manner adverse to
Stanley), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Black and Decker Board or any such committee thereof with respect to this
Agreement or the Merger or (B) adopt, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to adopt, recommend or declare advisable, any Black and Decker
Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being referred to as a
"Black and Decker Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) adopt, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, recommend or declare
advisable, or allow Black and Decker or any of its Affiliates to execute or
enter into, any Acquisition Agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Black and Decker
Takeover Proposal, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, Black and
Decker to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent with, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, Black and Decker to fail to comply with this
Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section
5.03(a)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the
Black and Decker Stockholder Approval, the Black and Decker Board may make a
Black and Decker Adverse Recommendation Change if Black and Decker receives a
Superior Black and Decker Proposal or the Black and Decker Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that
Black and Decker shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a Black
and Decker Adverse Recommendation Change until after the fifth Business
Day following Stanley's receipt of written notice (a "Black and Decker Notice
of Recommendation Change") from Black and Decker advising Stanley that
the Black and Decker Board intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including in the case of a Superior Black and Decker Proposal
the terms and conditions of such Superior Black and Decker Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action by the Black and Decker Board (it
being understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of such
Superior Black and Decker Proposal shall require a new Black and Decker Notice
of Recommendation Change and a new five Business Day period). In determining
whether to make a Black and Decker Adverse Recommendation Change, the Black and
Decker Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Stanley in response to a Black and Decker Notice
of Recommendation Change or otherwise.

promulgated under the Exchange Act or taking and disclosing to its
stockholders positions required by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under

if such provision was applicable, or (iii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Black and Decker if, in the good faith judgment of the Black and

would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that in no event shall Black and Decker or the Black and Decker Board or
any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any action
prohibited by Section 5.03(b).

business combination, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock of or
other equity interests in a Black and Decker Subsidiary or otherwise) of any
business or assets of Black and Decker or the Black and Decker Subsidiaries
representing 10% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets

power of Black and Decker, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the
stockholders of any Person) shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial
ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any

Stanley and Black and Decker agree, and shall cause each of their respective
Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain any Consents of any Governmental Entity, and to make any
registrations, declarations, notices or filings, if any, necessary for

that individually or in the aggregate would not be material in relation to
the Black and Decker Power Tools and Accessories segment (or, with respect to

provide that, at the Effective Time, each such Black and Decker Stock Option

multiplying the number of shares of Black and Decker Common Stock subject to
such Black and Decker Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share of Stanley Common Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
equal to (A) the per share exercise price for the shares of Black and Decker
Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Black and Decker Stock
Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an
"Adjusted Option");

a sufficient number of shares of Stanley Common Stock for delivery (i) with
respect to the Black and Decker Restricted Shares and Black and Decker Restricted
Stock Units and (ii) in connection with the exercise of the

filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another

a number of shares of Stanley Common Stock equal to the number of shares of
Stanley Common Stock subject to the Adjusted Options and that will be
received by holders of Black and Decker Restricted Shares and Black and Decker
Restricted Stock Units pursuant to Section 6.04(a). Stanley shall use
reasonable efforts to maintain (to the extent permitted under applicable Law)

with, and assist Stanley in the preparation of, such registration statement.

or officers of Black and Decker and the Black and Decker Subsidiaries (each, an
"Indemnified Person") as provided in their respective charters or bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) and any indemnification or other similar
agreements of Black and Decker or any of the Black and Decker Subsidiaries, in
each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall be assumed by
Stanley in the Merger, without further action, as of the Effective Time and
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and for a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Person. Stanley shall cause (i) the Surviving Company to honor
all such obligations and (ii) the charter and bylaws of the Surviving Company
to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of current and former directors and
officers of Black and Decker and the Black and Decker Subsidiaries than are
presently set forth in the Black and Decker Articles and Black and Decker Bylaws,
and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any person
benefited by such provisions.

 

 

(b) In the event that Stanley or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, Stanley shall cause proper provision to be made
so that the successors and assigns of Stanley assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.05 contemporaneous with the closing of any such
consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance.

 

 

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, Stanley shall purchase a "tail"
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy for Black and Decker and
the Black and Decker Subsidiaries and their current and former directors,
officers and employees who are currently covered by the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by Black and Decker
or the Black and Decker Subsidiaries in a form reasonably acceptable to Black and
Decker that shall provide such directors, officers and employees with
coverage for six years following the Effective Time of not less than the
existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage
currently maintained by Black and Decker or the Black and Decker Subsidiaries.
Stanley shall maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder.

there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
shareholders of Stanley without the further approval of such shareholders,
(ii) after receipt of the Black and Decker Stockholder Approval, there shall be
made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders
of Black and Decker without the further approval of such stockholders, (iii) no
amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time and (iv)
except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall require the
approval of the shareholders of Stanley or the stockholders of Black and

Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive

stockholders of Black and Decker unless such approval is required by Law. Any
agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights.

termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant

Section 5.1 Number of Directors. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. The

on the Board of Directors in the manner provided in the Bylaws.

 

 

Section 5.2 Authorization by Board of Stock Issuance. The Board of Directors
may authorize the issuance from time to time of shares of stock of the
Corporation of any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, or
securities or rights convertible into shares of its stock of any class or
series, whether now or hereafter authorized, for such consideration as the
Board of Directors may deem advisable (or without consideration in the case
of a stock split or stock dividend), subject to such restrictions or
limitations, if any, as may be set forth in the charter (the "Charter") or
the Bylaws.

 

 

Section 5.3 Indemnification. The Corporation shall have the power, to the
full extent permitted by, and in the manner permissible under, the laws of

indemnify, and pay and advance expenses for the benefit of, any person who is
or was an employee or agent of the Corporation, or who is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation
or entity, or who is or was serving as an officer or director of the
Corporation or at the request of the Corporation as an officer or director
(or similar position) of another corporation or entity, who by reason of his
or her position was, is, or is threatened to be made a party to an action or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or
investigative, against any and all expenses (including, but not limited to,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
actually incurred by the director, officer, employee or agent in connection
with the proceeding. The Corporation shall have the power to indemnify, and
to pay and advance expenses for the benefit of, any individual who served
a predecessor of the Corporation in any of the capacities described above.
Repeal or modification of this Section 5.3 or the relevant law shall not
affect adversely any rights or obligations then existing with respect to any
state of facts then or theretofore existing or any action, suit,
or proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole
or in part upon any such state of facts.

 

 

Section 5.4 Appraisal Rights. Holders of shares of stock shall not be
entitled to exercise any rights of an objecting stockholder provided for
under Title 3, Subtitle 2 of the MGCL or any successor statute unless the
Board of Directors, upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of
Directors, shall determine that such rights apply, with respect to all or any
classes or series of stock, to one or more transactions occurring after the
date of such determination in connection with which holders of such shares
would otherwise be entitled to exercise such rights.

permitting or requiring any action to be taken or approved by the affirmative
vote of the holders of shares entitled to cast a greater number of votes, any
such action shall be effective and valid if declared advisable by the Board
of Directors and taken or approved by the affirmative vote of holders of
shares entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on
the matter.

 

 

Section 5.6 Consent in Lieu of Meeting. Any action required or permitted to
be taken at any meeting of stockholders may be taken without a meeting if a
consent in writing or by electronic transmission of stockholders entitled to
cast not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take the action at a meeting of stockholders is delivered to the

ARTICLE VI

 



 

STOCK

 



 

Section 6.1 Authorized Shares. The Corporation has authority to issue 100
shares of stock, consisting of 100 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value
per share. The aggregate par value of all authorized shares of stock having
par value is $1.00. The Board of Directors, with the approval of a majority
of the entire Board and without any action by the stockholders of the
Corporation, may amend the Charter from time to time to increase or
decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of
stock of any class or series that the Corporation has authority to issue.

 

 

Section 6.2 Classified or Reclassified Shares. The Board of Directors may
reclassify any unissued shares of stock of the Corporation from time to time
in one or more classes or series of stock. If shares of one class of stock
are classified or reclassified into shares of another class of stock pursuant
to this Article VI, the number of authorized shares of the former class shall
be automatically decreased and the number of shares of the latter class shall
be automatically increased, in each case by the number of shares so
classified or reclassified, so that the aggregate number of shares of stock
of all classes that the Corporation has authority to issue shall not be more
than the total number of shares of stock set forth in the first sentence of
Section 6.1. Prior to issuance of classified or reclassified shares of any
class or series, the Board of Directors by resolution shall: (i) designate
that class or series to distinguish it from all other classes and series of
stock of the Corporation; (ii) specify the number of shares to be included in
the class or series; (iii) set or change, subject to the express terms of any
class or series of stock of the Corporation outstanding at the time, the
preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions,
limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms
and conditions of redemption for each class or series; and (iv) cause the
Corporation to file articles supplementary with the State Department of
Assessments and Taxation of Maryland. Any of the terms of any class or series
of stock set or changed pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 6.2 may be
made dependent upon facts or events ascertainable outside the Charter
(including determinations by the Board of Directors or other facts or events
within the control of the Corporation) and may vary among holders thereof,
provided that the manner in which such facts, events or variations shall
operate upon the terms of such class or series of stock is clearly and
expressly set forth in the articles supplementary or other charter document.

Section 6.3 Charter and Bylaws. The rights of all stockholders and the terms
of all stock are subject to the provisions of the Charter and the Bylaws.
The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the exclusive power to
make, alter, amend or repeal the Bylaws.

 

 

ARTICLE VII

 



 

AMENDMENTS

 



 

The Corporation reserves the right from time to time to make any amendment to
its Charter, now or hereafter authorized by law, including any amendment
altering the terms or contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Charter,
of any shares of outstanding stock. All rights and powers conferred by the
Charter on stockholders, directors and officers are granted subject to
this reservation.

 

 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

 



 

To the fullest extent permitted by Maryland law, as it may be amended from
time to time, no person who at any time was or is a director or officer of
the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its
stockholders for money damages. No amendment of the Charter or repeal of any
of its provisions shall limit or eliminate any of the benefits provided to
directors and officers under this Article VIII in respect of any act or
omission that occurred prior to such amendment or repeal.
