the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended (the "
_DGCL_ ").

C. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub has, upon the terms and subject to

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and the covenants,
premises, representations and warranties and agreements contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article 7_ , as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days) after the date hereof, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d 2 under the
Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase for cash any and all (i) Company Shares
(other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section
2.1(b)_) at the Company Share Offer Price, (ii) shares of Series A Preferred
Stock at

 



2  the Series A Offer Price and (iii) shares of Series B Preferred Stock at the
Series B Offer Price. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment, purchase and pay for all Company Shares and shares of
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer, subject only to: (a) there being validly
tendered in the Offer (in the aggregate) and not properly withdrawn prior to
the Expiration Date (1) that number of Company Shares and shares of Company
Preferred Stock that, together with the number of Company Shares and shares of
Company Preferred Stock (if any) then owned by the Parent, equals at least a
majority in voting power of the Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred
Stock then issued and outstanding, voting together as a single class, (2) that
number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock that, together with the number
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock (if any) then owned by Parent, equals at
least a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock then issued and
outstanding, and (3) that number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
that, together with the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock (if any)
then owned by Parent, equals at least a majority of the shares of Series B
Preferred Stock then issued and outstanding (collectively, the " _Minimum
Condition_ "); and (b) the satisfaction, or waiver by Merger Sub, of the
other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I.

(b) On or prior to the date that Merger Sub becomes obligated to pay for
Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to the Offer,
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis
funds sufficient to purchase and pay for any and all Company Shares and
shares of Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, that Merger Sub shall become
obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer. Subject to
the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by
Merger Sub, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I,
Merger Sub shall accept for payment (the time of such acceptance, the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and pay for all Company Shares and shares of Company
Preferred Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable following the Expiration Date, and, in any event,
no more than three Business Days after the Expiration Date. The Offer Price
payable in respect of each Company Share and share of Company Preferred
Stock, as applicable, validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer shall be paid to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with applicable Law and this Agreement, including the conditions
and requirements set forth in Annex I. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, Parent and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to increase the Offer
Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer;
provided, however, that except with the prior written approval of the
Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of
Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock sought to be purchased in
the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of
the other conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex I in a manner adverse to
the holders of Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock, (vi)
impose conditions to the Offer that are in addition to the conditions to the
Offer set forth in Annex I hereto, (vii) except as provided in _Sections
1.1(e)_ and _1.1(f)_ , terminate, accelerate or otherwise modify or amend the
Offer to accelerate the Expiration Date, or (viii) otherwise modify or amend
any of the other terms of the Offer in a manner adverse in any material
respect to the holders of Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock.

 



3 (d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined
using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) (such date and
time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date
has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to
which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or
such later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

 

(e) If on any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the conditions to the
Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and
requirements set forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied or waived by Merger
Sub, Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend the Offer
for successive periods of up to 10 Business Days each, or such longer period
as may be agreed between Merger Sub and the Company, in order to permit the
satisfaction of such conditions; provided, however, that Merger Sub shall not
be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. The " _Outside Date_
" shall be July 15, 2017. In addition, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for
any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules,
regulations, interpretations or positions of SEC or its staff.

 

(f) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article 7_. If this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 7_ , Merger Sub shall (and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly (and in any event within 24
hours following such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate
the Offer and shall not acquire any Company Shares or shares of Company
Preferred Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by
Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the Acceptance Time,
Merger Sub shall (and the Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) promptly return,
and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in
accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Company Shares and shares of
Company Preferred Stock to the registered holders thereof and Merger Sub shall
not (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub not to) accept any Company Shares or
shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to the Offer.

 

(g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Merger Sub shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3
under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect
to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer
to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary
advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and Merger Sub agree to
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares and
shares of Company Preferred Stock, as and to the extent required by federal
securities Laws, including the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly notify the other
party and correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents, if and to the

 



4  extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Merger Sub agrees to cause the
Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to holders of Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock, in each
case, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its
counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and
the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger
Sub shall give due consideration to any additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall provide them a written summary of any oral
comments, that Parent and Merger Sub or its counsel may receive from time to
time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer
Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral
responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such responses and Parent and Merger Sub shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.

 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14d-9 thereunder, file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall, subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.3_, contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall
also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion,
together with a summary thereof in customary form, and a notice, in
compliance with Section 262 of the DGCL, of appraisal rights in connection
with the Merger under the DGCL, and notice to the holders of Company Preferred
Stock regarding the Transactions as required by the Company Charter. The
Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a
description of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company further agrees to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares and
shares of Company Preferred Stock, as and when required by the Exchange Act.
If requested by Merger Sub, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Company Shares and shares
of Company Preferred Stock together with the Offer Documents disseminated to
the holders of Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock. Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to
promptly notify the other party and correct any information included in, or
incorporated by reference into, the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that
it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock, in each case,
as and to the extent required by federal securities Laws, including the
Exchange Act. Merger Sub and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Merger Sub and its counsel. In
addition, the Company shall provide Merger Sub and its counsel with copies of
any written comments, and shall provide them with a written summary of any
oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time
from the SEC or its

 



5  staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Merger Sub and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any such
written responses and the Company shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Merger Sub and
its counsel.

 

(b) From time to time as reasonably requested by Merger Sub or its agents, the
Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Merger Sub mailing labels,
security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other
listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record or
beneficial holders of the Company Shares and shares of Company
Preferred Stock, as applicable, as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such information (including updated
lists of holders of the Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock
and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-
objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Merger Sub or
its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and
beneficial holders of Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock.
In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any third parties to, cooperate
with Merger Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of Company
Shares held in or subject to any Company Equity Plan, and to permit such
holders of Company Shares to tender Company Shares in the Offer. Subject to
any and all Laws, and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate
the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the
Merger, Parent and Merger Sub and their agents shall: (i) hold in confidence
the information contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels
and listings, computer files or files of securities positions in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger.

 

1.3 _The Merger_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").
The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective
Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation. The Offer, the Merger and other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are referred to herein as the " _Transactions_ ".

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in
the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto, and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, the

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each Company Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Company Shares irrevocably
accepted for payment in the Offer, Company Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
_Section 2.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to
receive the Company Share Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_.
As of the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Company
Share held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or
Merger Sub, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or
payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. Each
Company Share held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company or of Parent, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall automatically be converted into such number of shares of the Surviving
Corporation so as to maintain the same relative ownership percentages.

 

(c) _Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than shares of Series A Preferred Stock irrevocably accepted for payment in
the Offer or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into and thereafter
represent the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Series A Offer Price, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with _Section
2.2_. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Series A Preferred Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Series A Offer Price to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 

(d) _Conversion of Series B Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series B Preferred
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other
than shares of Series B Preferred Stock irrevocably accepted for payment in

represent the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the Series B Offer Price, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law, upon surrender of the Certificates in accordance with _Section
2.2_. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Series B Preferred Stock
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Series B Offer Price to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

 



8 (e) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become (in the aggregate) 100 shares of newly and validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_ At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and
terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) for purposes of delivering or causing to be delivered to each
holder of Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock, the Merger
Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price, as
applicable, that such holder shall become entitled to receive with respect to
such holders Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Agreement (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be
paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient for the Paying
Agent to distribute the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price and the
Series B Offer Price, to which holders of Company Shares and holders of shares
of Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are
insufficient to make the payments contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.1_,
Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent such additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient
funds to make such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the
holders of the Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments shall be in obligations of,
or guaranteed by, the United States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better
by Moodys Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of the Surviving Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall
accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Shares or holders of shares of
Company Preferred Stock.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Shares
or shares of Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented
by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Company Shares were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and which shares of Company
Preferred Stock were converted into the right to receive the Series A Offer
Price or the Series B Offer Price, as applicable, at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, shall include any certifications Parent may reasonably request relating
to any withholding obligations of

 



9  Parent under the Code or other applicable Tax law, and shall otherwise be in
such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_) in
exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or
the Series B Offer Price, as applicable. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_)
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, and such other documents as
may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Company Share, or the Series A Offer Price or Series B Offer Price for each
share of Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, formerly represented by such
Certificates (without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and any Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price, as
applicable, is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or
the Series B Offer Price, as applicable, to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price,
as applicable, as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Certificates
representing Company Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed
to represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company
Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the
DGCL.

(ii) _Book-Entry Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") shall be required
to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Company
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Company Shares held
through The Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant
to this Agreement shall, upon receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent (or such other evidence of transfer or surrender as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository Trust Company or its nominee
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
in respect of each such Book-Entry Company Share pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article 2_ (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Company
Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than three Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause

 



10  the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Company Shares not held
through The Depository Trust Company: (A) a letter of transmittal, which
shall include any certifications Parent may reasonably request relating to any
withholding obligations of Parent under the Code or other applicable Tax law
and be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree;
and (B) instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Book-Entry Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in respect of each such Book-Entry
Company Share pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ (without
interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided
in _Section 2.5_), and such Book-Entry Company Shares shall at the Effective
Time be cancelled. Payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Company Shares shall only be made to the Person in
whose name such Book-Entry Company Shares are registered. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Company
Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry
Company Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated
by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Company Shares representing Company
Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL. 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares or
shares of Company Preferred Stock on the records of the Company. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry
Company Shares that represented ownership of Company Shares or shares of
Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares or shares
of Company Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares on the six month anniversary of the
Effective Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate
thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares for
the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer
Price, as applicable, in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price, as
applicable, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law, in respect of such holders surrender of their Certificates
or Book-Entry Company Shares and compliance with the procedures in _Section
2.2(b)_. Any Merger Consideration, Series A Offer Price or Series B Offer
Price, as applicable, remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry

 



11  Company Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Company Shares for Merger
Consideration, Series A Offer Price or Series B Offer Price, as applicable,
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration, the Series A
Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price, as applicable, made available to the
Paying Agent pursuant to  _Section 2.2(a)_, to pay for Company Shares or
shares of Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, for which appraisal rights
have been perfected shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificates to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Merger Consideration, the
Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price, as applicable, payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, Series A Offer Price or Series B Offer Price, as applicable,
require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a
bond in a reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation
or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

2.3  _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_), Company
Shares and shares of Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has
properly demanded appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with, and
who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company
Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, the Series A Offer Price or the Series B
Offer Price, as applicable. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to
exist, and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the rights granted to them under Section 262 of
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, the
Series A Offer Price or the Series B Offer Price, as applicable, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with this _Article 2_ and shall not thereafter be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Company Shares or shares of Company
Preferred Stock and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value of
Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and

 



12  control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise,
any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing, except to the extent required by applicable Law

 

2.4 _Treatment of Options and Restricted Share Units Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_.

 

 __(i) _Vested Company Options_. Each option to purchase Company Shares (each
a " _Company Option_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is vested as of the Effective Time (after taking into account any vesting
acceleration provided in the Company Equity Plan or award agreement applicable
to such Company Option by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions)
(each, a " _Vested Company Option_ "), shall, automatically at the Effective
Time and without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Vested Company Option to
receive an amount in cash, with respect to such Vested Company Option, equal
to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per Company Share of such Vested Company Option and
(B) the number of Company Shares for which such Vested Company Option may be
exercised, payable (without interest less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld pursuant to _Section 2.5_) in a lump sum promptly following
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per
Company Share subject to a Vested Company Option is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration. _ _

__(ii) _Unvested Company Options_. Each Company Option outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is not vested as of the Effective Time
(after taking into account any vesting acceleration and forfeiture provisions
provided in the Company Equity Plan and award agreement applicable to such
Company Option by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions) (each, an "
_Unvested Company Option_ "), shall, automatically at the Effective Time and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into an option to purchase shares of Parent common stock (an " _Adjusted
Option_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
vesting terms and conditions), with the number of shares of Parent
common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares) subject to
such Adjusted Option equal to the product of (A) the total number of Company
Shares underlying such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Conversion Amount (as
defined below), and with the exercise price applicable to such Adjusted Option
to equal the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by
dividing (1) the exercise price per Company Share applicable to such Unvested
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, by (2) the Equity
Award Conversion Amount; provided, however, that to the extent that any such
Unvested Company Option is subject to a "Share Price Condition" (as defined
in the award agreement applicable to such Unvested Company Option), and such
Share Price Condition has not been achieved as of the __

 



13 _ _ Effective Time, such Share Price Condition shall be adjusted by dividing
the dollar value applicable to such Share Price Condition by the Equity Award
Conversion Amount; provided, further, that the exercise price and the number
of shares of Parent common stock underlying the Adjusted Option shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code; provided, further, that, in the case of any Unvested Company Option to
which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of
shares of Parent common stock underlying the corresponding Adjusted Option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. For purposes of this Agreement, "Equity Award Conversion
Amount" means the quotient obtained by dividing the Merger Consideration
by the volume-weighted average trading price of the Parent common stock on
NASDAQ for the five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. __

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Share Unit Awards_.

 

 __(i) _Vested Company RSUs_. Each restricted share unit award in respect of
the Company Shares (each a " _Company RSU_ ") outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that is vested as of the Effective Time (after taking
into account any vesting acceleration provided in the Company Equity Plan or
award agreement applicable to such Company RSU by reason of this Agreement or
the Transactions) (each, a _"Vested Company RSU_ "), shall, automatically at
the Effective Time and without any required action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Vested
Company RSU to receive an amount in cash, with respect to the Company Shares
underlying such Vested Company RSU, equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Company Shares underlying such Company
RSU, payable (without interest and less applicable Taxes required to be
withheld with respect to such payment pursuant to _Section 2.5_) in a lump
sum promptly following the Closing Date (or such later time as required
under Section 409A of the Code). __

__(ii) _Unvested Company RSUs_. Each Company RSU outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time that is not vested as of the Effective Time (after
taking into account any vesting acceleration and forfeiture provisions
provided in the Company Equity Plan and award agreement applicable to such
Company RSU by reason of this Agreement or the Transactions) (each, an "
_Unvested Company RSU_ "), shall, automatically at the Effective Time and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
into a restricted stock unit award in respect of Parent common stock (an "
_Adjusted RSU_ ") on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such
Unvested Company RSU (including vesting terms and conditions), and relating to
the number of shares of Parent common stock equal to the product of (A) the
number of Shares subject to such Unvested Company RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (B) the Equity Award Conversion Amount, with any
fractional shares of Parent common stock rounded to the nearest whole number
of shares of Parent common stock. To the extent that any such Unvested Company
RSU is subject to a "Share Price Condition" (as defined in the award agreement
applicable to such Unvested Company RSU), and such Share Price Condition has
not been achieved as of the Effective Time, such Share Price Condition shall
be adjusted by dividing the dollar value applicable to such Share Price
Condition by the Equity Award Conversion Amount. __

 



14 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, any Company Option or Company RSU that is
forfeited as of the Effective Time pursuant to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Company Equity Plan and award agreement applicable to such
Company Option or Company RSU (in each case, as in effect as of the date
hereof), (i) shall not be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of this _Section 2.4_, and (ii) shall
automatically at the Effective Time be cancelled and forfeited for no
consideration.

 

(d) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_. As of the Effective Time, the
Amended and Restated Derma Sciences, Inc. 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the
Derma Sciences, Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan, and the Derma
Sciences, Inc. Restricted Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Equity Plan_ " and,
collectively, the " _Company Equity Plans_ ") shall be terminated and no
further Company Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Equity Interests or
other rights with respect to Company Shares shall be granted thereunder.

 

(e) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take such other actions as are reasonably necessary and appropriate (including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain any required consents) to effect the
transactions described in this _Section 2.4_.

 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the Treasury Regulations
or any other provision of applicable Law. Any amounts deducted or withheld
from any such payment shall be remitted to the applicable Tax Authority and,
when so remitted, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or
withholding was made.

2.6 _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company
Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock shall occur as a result of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of Equity Interests convertible into or exchangeable for Company
Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock), recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar event, the
applicable Offer Price, the Merger Consideration, the Series A Liquidation
Preference and/or the Series B Liquidation Preference, as applicable, shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such event and to provide to holders of Company
Shares and/or shares of Company Preferred Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that nothing in
this _Section 2.6_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to take
any such action or effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized
or permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 5.1_).

ARTICLE 3

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (a) as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") prior to the
execution of this

 



15  Agreement (with specific reference to the representations and warranties in
this _Article 3_ to which the information in such schedule relates;
_provided_ , that, disclosure in the Company Disclosure Schedule as to a
specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other sections of this
Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) it is reasonably apparent on its face that such disclosure relates
to such other sections), and (b) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents
filed since January 1, 2016 and publicly available at least 24 hours prior to
the execution and delivery of this Agreement (other than any disclosures
contained in the "Forward Looking Statements" or "Risk Factors" sections of
such Company SEC Documents, and any other disclosures contained in such
Company SEC Documents that are predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in
nature); provided that, the foregoing clause (b) shall not be applicable to
_Section 3.2_ or _Section 3.4_, the Company hereby represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the
extent applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character or
location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to

3.3 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_.

(a) The Company has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement, the performance and compliance by the Company
with each of its obligations herein, and the consummation by it of the
Transactions have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of the Company and, except for the Preferred Stock Consent (which has
been obtained), no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company and
no other stockholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions. The Company has duly and
validly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
except as may be limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors
rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether considered in a
Proceeding at law or in equity).

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, at which all of the
directors were present, unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving and
declaring advisable this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions,
(ii) determining that the terms of the Agreement and the Offer and the Merger
are fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders,
(iii) determining that the Merger shall be effected as soon as practicable
following the Acceptance Time without a vote of the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and (iv) recommending that its
stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares and shares of
Company Preferred Stock, as applicable, to Merger Sub in response to the Offer
(the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), which resolutions have not
been subsequently withdrawn, amended or modified as of the date of this
Agreement.

(c) The Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the
restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and
any other similar Law are not and will not be applicable to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in _Section 4.6_, no other
takeover, anti-takeover, business combination, moratorium, fair price, control
share acquisition 

 



18  or similar Law applies to the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions.
The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have in effect any stockholder rights
plan, "poison pill" or other similar plan or arrangement. Except for the
Preferred Consent (which has been obtained), the only vote of holders of any
class or series of Company Shares or other Equity Interests of the Company
necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger would be, in the
absence of Section 251(h) of the DGCL, the affirmative vote of holders of a
majority in voting power of the Company Shares and shares of Company Preferred
Stock outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single
class.

3.4 _No Conflicts_.

 

(a) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the acceptance for
payment or payment for Company Shares or shares of Company Preferred Stock,
as applicable, and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions and
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof will, (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of the Company Charter or the Company
Bylaws or any equivalent organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the
Company, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and
permits described in _Section 3.4(b)_ have been obtained and all filings
and notifications described in _Section 3.4(b)_ have been made and any
waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired, conflict with or
violate any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
bound or affected or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result in
any breach or violation of or any loss of any benefit under, constitute a
change of control or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become a default) under or give to others any right of
termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in
the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any Contract or Permit to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is party, except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the
acceptance for payment or payment for Company Shares or shares of Company
Preferred Stock, as applicable, and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions and compliance by the Company with any of the terms
or provisions hereof will, require any consent, approval, authorization or
permit of, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity, except
(i) filings required under, and compliance with other applicable requirements
of, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ , (ii) filings
required under, and compliance with any applicable requirements of, the HSR
Act and any other applicable Competition Laws, (iii) the filing and
effectiveness of the Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (iv)
where failure to obtain such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits,
or to make such filings, registrations or notifications, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

3.5 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) The Company has timely filed or furnished all reports, schedules, forms,
statements, registration statements, prospectuses and other documents
required to be filed or furnished by the Company with the SEC under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act since January 1, 2014 (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). None of the Subsidiaries of the Company is required to make
any filings with the SEC.

 



19 (b) As of its respective filing date, and, if amended, as of the date of the
last amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, each Company SEC Document
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or under the Exchange Act (the "
_Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Document and did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, occurring since
January 1, 2014 and prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof,
there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the
SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Documents. To the Knowledge
of the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC Documents is
the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC
investigation.

(c) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents (including, in each case, any notes or schedules
thereto) (the " _Company SEC Financial Statements_ ") fairly present, in all
material respects, the financial condition and the results of operations, cash
flows and changes in stockholders equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(on a consolidated basis) as of the respective dates of and for the periods
referred to in the Company SEC Financial Statements, and were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), subject, in the
case of interim Company SEC Financial Statements, to normal year-end
adjustments (none of which are material individually or in the aggregate) and
the absence of notes (none of which, if presented, would materially differ
from those in the year-end Company SEC Financial Statements). The Company SEC
Financial Statements were prepared from, and in accordance with, the
books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries in all material
respects, and complied as to form in all material respects with all applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto.

 

(d) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial
and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
required pursuant to 

 



20  Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
presented in any applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K
or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by such report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on
the Companys managements most recently completed evaluation of the
Companys internal control over financial reporting, (i) the Company had no
significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) the Company does not have
Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
or other employees who have a significant role in the Companys internal
control over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2014, the Companys
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed
to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financing
reporting, and the Company has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of any material written materials provided to the Companys auditors or
the audit committee of the Company Board relating to each of the foregoing.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any prohibited loans
or "extensions of credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act) to any executive officer (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the
Exchange Act) or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted
or unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect,
and whether or not accrued), required by GAAP to be reflected or reserved on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or the notes thereto) except (i) as
specifically reflected or adequately reserved against in the most recent
audited balance sheet included in the Company SEC Financial Statements or the
notes thereto, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the date of the most recent audited balance sheet
included in the Company SEC Financial Statements, (iii) for liabilities and
obligations arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or the Transactions and (iv) for liabilities and obligations that
have not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

3.6 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since January 1, 2016 through the
date of this Agreement, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted
their businesses in all material respects only in the ordinary course and in a
manner consistent with past practice and (b) there has not been any change,
event, development, condition or occurrence that has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2016
through the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has taken any action that would have constituted a breach of,
or required Parents consent pursuant to, _Sections 5.1(c)_, _(e)_ , _(f)_ ,
_(g)_ , _(h)_ , _(j)_ , _(k)_ , _(n)_ , _(p)_ or _(q)_.

 



21 3.7 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied
by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents (and any amendment or supplement thereto) will, when filed with the
SEC, when distributed or disseminated to holders of Company Shares or shares
of Company Preferred Stock, and at the Expiration Date, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are
made, not misleading (except that no representation or warranty is made by
the Company to such portions of the Offer Documents that relate to Parent and
its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or to statements made therein based on
information supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein). The Schedule 14D-9 will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and other
applicable Law, and will not, when filed with the SEC, when distributed or
disseminated to the Companys stockholders or at the Expiration Date, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in
which they are made, not misleading (except that no representation or warranty
is made by the Company to such portions of the Schedule 14D-9 that relate to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, including Merger Sub, or to statements made
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein).

any of its Subsidiaries or any assets owned or used by any of them. Except as

since January 1, 2014 from a Governmental Entity that alleges that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is in material violation of any such Law or

Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any director, officer,
agent, employee or other Person acting on behalf of the Company or any of its

any written communication from a Governmental Entity (x) related to any
investigation or inquiry with respect to a potential violation by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any Representative thereof of any Anti-
corruption Laws, or (y) that alleges that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Representative thereof is in violation of any Anti-
corruption Laws. During the past five (5) years, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has had a

 



22  customer or supplier or other business relationship with, is a party to any

licenses, permits, certificates, certifications, approvals, clearances,
consents, franchises, registrations, billing, exemptions and authorizations ("
_Permits_ ") necessary for the conduct of their business and the use of their
properties and assets, as presently conducted and used, and each of the
Permits is valid, subsisting and in full force and effect, except where the
failure to have or maintain such Permit has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The operation of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted is not, and has not
been since January 1, 2014, in violation of, nor is the Company or its
Subsidiaries in default or violation under, any Permit, and, to the Knowledge
of the Company, no event has occurred which, with notice or the lapse of time
or both, would constitute a default or violation of any term, condition or
provision of any Permit, except where such default or violation of such Permit
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There are no actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, that seek the revocation, cancellation or modification of
any Permit, except where such revocation, cancellation or modification has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

Subsidiaries (each, a " _Service Provider_ "), or (B) for which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any direct or indirect liability (whether actual
or contingent) (each a " _Company Benefit Plan_ "). The term "Company Benefit
Plan" does not, however, include plans or arrangements administered by
a Governmental Entity or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
contribute pursuant to applicable Law or that are Multiemployer Plans (as
defined below). Neither the Company, nor

 



23  to the Knowledge of the Company, any other Person or entity, has any express
or implied commitment, whether legally enforceable or not, to (i) modify,
change or terminate any Company Benefit Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code or (ii)
create any additional Company Benefit Plan. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has at any time in the last six years been, connected
with or an associate of (as those terms are used in the UK Pensions Act 2004)
the employer in a UK defined benefit pension plan.

 

(b) The Company has made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy
of each current Company Benefit Plan and the following related documents, to
the extent applicable: (i) the most recent copy of any summary plan
description and all written amendments, modifications or supplements

amendment, modification or supplement that is not in writing), (ii) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS or similar report required
to be filed with any Governmental Entity, (iii) the most recently received IRS
determination or opinion letter, (iv) each trust, insurance or administrative
agreement relating to any such Company Benefit Plan, (v) the most recent
actuarial report with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan, and (vi) all
filings, records and notices concerning audits or investigations by any
Governmental Entity. The Company is in full compliance with any obligations to
employees pursuant to the UK Pensions Act 2008.

 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, all contributions required to be made for
any period in the prior three (3) years through the date hereof to any Company
Benefit Plan by applicable Law, under the terms of any Company Benefit
Plan or under the terms of any other contractual undertaking have been timely
made or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
SEC Documents prior to the date of this Agreement, and all material premiums
due or payable for any period in the prior three (3) years through the date
hereof with respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan
have been timely paid or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the
most recent consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in
the Company SEC Documents prior to the date of this Agreement. With respect to
the Company Benefit Plans, (i) no event has occurred and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, there exists no condition or set of circumstances which could
result in material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii)
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, within the prior three
(3) years, taken corrective action or made a filing under any voluntary
correction program of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that has not been
resolved prior to the date hereof and, to the Companys Knowledge, no Company
Benefit Plan defect exists as of the date hereof that would qualify for
correction under any such program and for which a filing would be required in
order to effectuate such correction.

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualified status which letter has not been revoked (nor has
revocation been threatened in

 



24  writing) or may rely upon an opinion or advisory letter issued by the
Internal Revenue Service as to the tax qualification of such Company Benefit
Plans form of plan document as adopted , and each trust established in
connection with any Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so exempt, and to
the Companys Knowledge no fact or event has occurred that could adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt
status of any such trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan is
intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

(e) None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, nor, to the Companys Knowledge, any other
Person (including any fiduciary whom the Company has an obligation to
indemnify) has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and other than a transaction
that is exempt under a statutory or administrative exemption) which could
reasonably be expected to subject any of the Company Benefit Plans or their
related trusts, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates or any Person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has an obligation to indemnify, to liability. No material Proceeding
(including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of
Labor (other than routine benefits claims)) is pending, or to the Companys
Knowledge is threatened, against or with respect to any Company Benefit Plan,
any fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan with respect to such fiduciarys

5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article 7_, the
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (i) provide to the
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the business conducted by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, upon prior notice to the Company, to the officers, employees,
properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries and to the books and records thereof and (ii) promptly furnish
such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as the Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
reasonably believes that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-
client privilege (but the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss
of attorney-client privilege), (B) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties, or (C) breach, contravene or violate any applicable
Law.

 



46 (b) Each of the Parent and Merger Sub agrees that it will not, and will cause
its Representatives not to, prior to the Effective Time, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ for any competitive or other purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger. The Confidentiality
Agreement, dated October 13, 2016, by and between the Company and Parent (the
" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall apply with respect to information
furnished under this _Section 5.2_ by the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives.

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, (x)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and (y) deliver a written notice to any such Third Party
to the effect that the Company is terminating all discussions and
negotiations with such Third Party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
and requesting that such Third Party promptly return or destroy all
confidential information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except
as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and after the date hereof
until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to on behalf of
the Company, initiate, solicit, facilitate or knowingly encourage any
Acquisition Proposal or the making or submission thereof, or (y) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with a
Third Party regarding (other than to inform any Third Party of the existence
of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_) or (z) furnish or provide
any nonpublic information in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal. Except
as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, from and after the date hereof
until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with _Article 7_, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) withdraw, change,
qualify, withhold or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify,
withhold or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation, (iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement, (iv) in the event a tender offer that constitutes an
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act is

solicitation or recommendation statement made on Schedule 14D-9 within ten
(10) Business Days of such commencement, (v) approve, authorize or cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (vi) resolve or agree to do any
of the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(vi) of this sentence, a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (i)
the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third
Party, (ii) the Company has not breached this _Section 5.3_ and (iii) the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and

 



47  outside legal counsel, based on information then available, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal and that failure to take such actions would breach,
or would reasonably be expected to cause a breach of, its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such
Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and potential sources of financing
pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreements and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ , however, that any non-public information concerning the Company
or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to any Third Party shall, to
the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub,
be provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in no event later than twenty-four hours) after it
is provided or made available to such Third Party.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall identify the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and include a
copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where such Acquisition Proposal was not
submitted in writing, a reasonably detailed written description of such
Acquisition Proposal including its material terms and conditions). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent promptly informed (and
in any event within 24 hours) in all material respects of the status of,
and any material communications relating to, such Acquisition Proposal
(including any change in the price or other material terms thereof). The
Company shall not terminate, amend, modify, waive or fail to enforce any
provision of any "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person unless the
Company Board ( or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would breach, or would reasonably be expected to cause a
breach of, its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advises Parent that it is
taking such action and the identity of the Persons with respect to which it
is taking such action.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_,
if the Company has not breached this _Section 5.3_ and has received a bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Superior
Proposal, the Company Board may at any time prior to the Acceptance Time,
effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior
Proposal, subject to the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_. The Company
shall not be entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to
this _Section 5.3(d)_ unless:

 

(i) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such a Change of
Board Recommendation in response to the receipt of such Superior Proposal
would breach, or would reasonably be expected to cause a breach of, its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(ii) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least three Business Days
prior written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to
take such actions, which notice shall specify the basis for such Change of
Board Recommendation, the identity of the Third Party making such Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and
shall include a copy of the applicable Company Acquisition Agreement and any
other material documents with respect thereto,

 



48 (iii) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have, engaged in good
faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any
amendments or modifications to this Agreement proposed by Parent and intended
to cause the relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal; and

(iv) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board shall have considered
in good faith any proposed amendments or modifications to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other agreements
contemplated hereby that may be offered by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed
Terms_ ") no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of
the Notice Period and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such Proposed
Changed Terms were to be given effect and that failure to make a Change of
Board Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal would breach its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

In the event of any change to the price terms or any other material revision
or amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ (which shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ ) with respect to such new written notice, and that in the case
of such a new written notice, the Notice Period shall be two Business Days.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  _Section 5.3(a)_,
the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) may, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, effect a Change of Board Recommendation if the
Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good
faith that an Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing, subject to the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_. The Company shall not be entitled to
effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this  _Section 5.3(e)_
unless:

(i) the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure
to effect a Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening
Event would breach, or would reasonably be expected to cause a breach of, its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; 

(ii) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least three Business Days
prior written notice of the Companys intention to take such action, which
notice shall specify the basis for such Change of Board Recommendation,
including all available material information with respect to such Intervening
Event;

 

(iii) during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have, and shall have caused its Representatives to have,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives
regarding any amendments or modifications to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent and intended to enable the Company Board to proceed with the
Company Board Recommendation;

 



49 (iv) at the end of such three Business Day period, the Company Board shall
have considered in good faith any proposed amendments or modifications to
this Agreement (including a change to the price terms hereof) and the other
agreements contemplated hereby that may be irrevocably offered in writing by
Parent no later than 11:59 a.m., New York City time, on the last day of such
three Business Day period, and shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to effect a
Change of Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would
breach its fiduciary duties under applicable Law

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to make such disclosure would breach, or would reasonably be
expected to cause a breach of, its fiduciary duties or violate applicable Law;
provided that any Change of Board Recommendation may only be made in
accordance with _Sections 5.3(d)_ and _5.3(e)_. The issuance by the Company
or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure
of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Board Recommendation.

 

(g) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.3_ by any of its Representatives shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, offer or proposal from a
Third Party concerning (A) a merger, consolidation, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, business combination transaction or similar
transaction involving the Company, (B) a sale, lease or other disposition by
merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, joint venture or
otherwise, of assets of the Company (including Equity Interests of any
Subsidiary of the Company) or its Subsidiaries representing 15% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, based on their
fair market value as determined in good faith by the Company Board (or any
duly authorized committee thereof), (C) an issuance or acquisition (including
by way of merger, consolidation, business combination or share exchange) of
Equity Interests representing 15% or more of the voting power of the Company,
or (D) any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Offer
and the Merger).

 

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%") that is
not solicited or received in violation, or resulting from any breach, of this
_Section 5.3_ and that the Company Board (or a duly authorized committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, taking into account such factors as the
Company

 



50  Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) considers in good faith to
be appropriate (including the conditionality, timing and likelihood of
consummation of such proposals), is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms and, if consummated, would be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than the Offer and the
Merger (taking in account any Proposed Changed Terms).

 

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, effect, development,
state of facts, condition or occurrence that is material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries that (A) was not known to or by the Company Board and could
not reasonably be expected to have been known to or by the Company Board as of
or prior to the date of this Agreement (or if known, the magnitude or
material consequences of which were not known and could not reasonably be
expected to have been known to or by the Company Board as of or prior to the
date of this Agreement), and (B) does not involve or relate to the
receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal.

5.4 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) obtain all consents, approvals or waivers from,
or participation in other discussions or negotiations with, third parties,
including under any Contract to which the Company or Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries is party or by which such Person or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound (provided, that the Company shall
not pay or agree to pay any material consent fees or other material payments
requested by any such third parties without the written consent of Parent, not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and
authorizations from Governmental Entities (including, without limitation,
those in connection with applicable Competition Laws), make all necessary
registrations, declarations and filings with and take all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid any Proceeding
by, any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, in connection with
applicable Competition Laws), (iii) resist, contest or defend any Proceeding
(including administrative or judicial Proceedings) challenging the Offer, the
Merger or the completion of the Transactions, including seeking to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Transactions,
and (iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to
consummate the Transactions and fully to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties shall furnish to each other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Parent shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall
consult with the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Offer, the Merger and the 

 



51  Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and
Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Subject to
applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company
and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing
the other with copies of notices or other written substantive communications
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third party with
respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under
the circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance and not
in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent shall, and
shall cause their respective affiliates to, make or cause to be made all
filings required under applicable Competition Laws with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as practicable and, in any event, file all required
HSR Act notifications within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with the receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances of a Governmental
Entity, except as otherwise approved by Parent in its sole discretion, neither
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates shall be required, nor shall
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be permitted, to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of any of their respective assets or businesses, conduct
their business in a specified manner, agree to any of the foregoing, or enter
into or agree to enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement,
"hold separate" agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement
with respect to, any assets of Parent or the Company or their respective
Subsidiaries.

 

(c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger.

5.5 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_, unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Entity or NASDAQ (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party
becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement being incapable of satisfaction. Any such notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.5_ shall not affect any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement and any failure to make such notice (in
and of itself) shall not be taken into account in determining whether the
conditions set forth in _this Agreement_ have been satisfied or give rise to
any right of termination set forth in _Article 7_.

5.6 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent
and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, shall not
issue any press release or

 



52  make any public statement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as
may be required by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any
applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory or governmental
body to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required
to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b) with respect to any
press release or other public statement by the Company permitted by _Section
5.3_. The press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement shall be a joint release of, and shall not be issued prior to the
approval of each of, the Company and Parent. The Company shall (i) file a
current report on Form 8-K with the SEC attaching its press release and copy
of this Agreement as exhibits and (ii) file a pre-commencement communication
on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC attaching its press release. Parent and Merger
Sub shall file a pre-commencement communication on Schedule TO with the SEC
attaching the press release. 

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for the period ending on December
31, 2017, the Parent shall (i) provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries,
including the Surviving Corporation, to provide to each employee of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who
remains employed by the Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) following the Effective Time (each a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") base compensation that is not less favorable than the base
compensation provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide or cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation, to provide benefits (including target annual cash
bonus opportunity, but excluding equity or equity-linked compensation and
excluding benefits provided pursuant to any defined benefit pension plan) to
each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, have a value that is
substantially similar in the aggregate as such benefits provided to similarly-
situated employees of the Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, or provided to
such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, as
determined by the Parent in its discretion.

(b) With respect to benefit plans maintained by the Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any
vacation and paid time-off plans), for all purposes, including determining
eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals,
each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, as reflected in the Companys records, shall be treated as
service with the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation where length of service is relevant, in any case, to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled prior to the Effective
Time under any similar Company Benefit Plan; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service need not be recognized or credited (i) to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) with
respect to a newly established plan for which prior service is not taken
into account, or (iii) if it results in benefit accruals with respect to any
defined benefit pension plan.

(c) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to take reasonable best efforts to, waive, or cause to
be waived, any

 



53  pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by the Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Corporation, to take reasonable best efforts to recognize, or cause to be
recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

(d) Unless otherwise requested by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the
Closing, the Company shall not terminate any Company Benefit Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_"). If
requested by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall terminate any Company 401(k) Plan identified by Parent in its request,
effective as of the day immediately prior to the Effective Time and contingent
upon the occurrence of the Effective Time, and the Company shall provide
Parent with evidence of such termination (the form and substance of which
shall be subject to reasonable review and comment by Parent) no later than
five (5) days immediately preceding the Effective Time. If Parent requests
that the Company terminate any Company 401(k) Plan in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, Parent shall permit each Continuing Employee
who is, at the time that such termination is requested by Parent, actively
employed and participating in the applicable Company 401(k) Plan to elect a
"direct rollover" of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) into Parents applicable defined contribution
plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement within the meaning
of Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") in the form of
cash, promissory notes (in the case of outstanding loans) or a combination
thereof in an amount equal to the full account balance (including earnings
thereon) distributed to such Continuing Employee from the applicable Company
401(k) Plan (the " _Rollover_ "); provided, that Parent will only permit the
Rollover (or cause the Parent 401(k) Plan to accept the Rollover) if, in
Parents reasonable good faith judgment, such Rollover will not result in
liability to Parent or its Affiliates (including, but not limited to,
liability by reason of the applicable Company 401(k) Plan failing to be a
tax-qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the Code).

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall seek and use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into a written agreement with each individual who
is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the
Code) with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which agreement
shall provide that, if any payments or benefits to which such disqualified
individual becomes entitled constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning
of Section 280G of the Code, and but for such agreement, would be subject to
the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, then such disqualified
individual will be entitled to receive either (i) the full amount of such
payments or benefits or (ii) a portion of such payments or benefits having an
aggregate value equal to $1 less than three times such individuals "base
amount" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3)(A) of the Code), 

 



54  whichever of (i) or (ii), after taking into account applicable federal,
state, and local income and employment taxes and the excise tax imposed by
Section 4999 of the Code or any successor provision of the Code or any
similar state or local tax, results in the receipt by such disqualified
individual of the greatest portion of such payments or benefits on an after-
tax basis. At least five (5) Business Days prior to taking the action
described in the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall deliver to
Parent for review and comment copies of the form of agreement described in the
immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall consider in good faith
all comments received from Parent on such document.

(f) No later than thirty (30) days following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall deliver to Parent a schedule listing, as of the most recent
practicable date prior to the delivery of such schedule: (i) each holder of
Company Stock Awards and (ii) on a holder-by-holder and grant-by-grant basis,
(a) the date on which each Company Stock Award was granted, (b) the type and
number of Company Stock Awards granted (specifying whether such award is an
"incentive stock option" or "nonqualified stock option", if applicable), (c)
the Company Equity Plan pursuant to which such Company Award was granted, (d)
the expiration date of such Company Stock Award, (e) the price at which such
Company Stock Award may be exercised (if applicable), (f) the date upon which
any Company RSU is to be settled (if such Company RSU represents "nonqualified
deferred compensation" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code), and (g) the
vesting schedule (including, but not limited to, (1) for any Company Stock
Award that is subject to performance-based vesting and for which performance
has not been determined, the performance based vesting terms applicable to
such Company Stock Award and (2) any provision that accelerates vesting
and/or settlement of the Company Stock Award (including, but not limited to,
any provision that would accelerate the vesting or settlement of the Company
Stock Award upon or in connection with the execution of the Agreement or the
Transactions).

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.10_, the provisions of this
_Section 5.7_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof)
shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement, and no provision of this  _Section 5.7_ shall create such rights
in any such individuals. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall: (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the ability of the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates to terminate
the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time and for any reason; (ii)
require the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit
plans, programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Company Benefit
Plans or other employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

 

5.8 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall advance
expenses as incurred (provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such amounts if it is ultimately
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification for such matter), to the extent provided in (i)
the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents of
any Subsidiary of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
(ii) any indemnification Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in effect as of the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 5.8_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, each present and former director and officer of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or
pertaining to matters any action or omission by such Indemnitee relating to
their position with the Company or its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar organization documents of any
Subsidiary of

 



55  the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) any
indemnification Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of this Agreement listed on  _Section 5.8_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six
years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of an
Indemnitee as provided in (i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws
or similar organizational documents of any Subsidiary of the Company in
effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii) any indemnification Contract
of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement
listed on  _Section 5.8_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and shall not
amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in
respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
for the benefit of those persons that are directors and officers of the
Company, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date,
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing
Date (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any
event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy of the
Company, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable,
the best available coverage then available; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the
date of this Agreement. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been
obtained prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors
and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six years with
respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper
provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or
in any indemnification Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 5.8_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. From and

 



56  after the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent under this _Section
5.8_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees
to whom this _Section 5.8_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.8_).

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.8_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

necessary or advisable to cause Merger Sub to perform its covenants,
agreements and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof.

5.10 _Takeover Statutes_. If any state takeover Law or state Law that
purports to limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire
or vote Company Shares (including any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "business combination" or other similar takeover Law) becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Offer, the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the
Company and the Company Board shall take all action reasonably available to
it to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

5.11 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and any other dispositions of Company Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Shares) resulting from

requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company,
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors and officers relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger (" _Transaction Litigation_ "), and no such settlement of any
Transaction Litigation shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Company shall promptly notify Parent of any Transaction Litigation and
shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof.

5.13 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. The Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Companys securities to be de-listed from NASDAQ and de-registered under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, and
prior to the Effective Time the Company shall reasonably cooperate with
Parent with respect thereto.

 



57 5.14 _Regulatory Matters_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in good
faith to develop the strategy and process by which the parties will
communicate with all Governmental Entities regarding any plans or strategies
in pursuit of future Regulatory Permits, changes to existing Regulatory
Permits, and the conduct or design of clinical trials in furtherance thereof
(collectively, the " _Regulatory Matters_ "). To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Company shall (a) give Parent prompt notice upon obtaining
knowledge of any written request, inquiry or communication from or by the FDA
in connection with any such Regulatory Matters (b) keep Parent reasonably
informed in a timely manner as to the status of any such request, inquiry or
communication, and (c) permit Parent to review any material communication
delivered to, and consult with Parent in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the FDA relating to such Regulatory Matters. The Company will consult
and cooperate with Parent, and consider in good faith the reasonable views of
Parent, in connection with, and provide to Parent in advance, any responses,
materials, analyses, presentations, memoranda, or proposals to be made or
submitted to the FDA in connection with the Regulatory Matters.

 

5.15 _14d-10 Matters_. The parties acknowledge that certain payments have been
made or are to be made and certain benefits have been granted or are to be
granted according to employment compensation, severance and other employee
benefit plans of the Company, including the Company Benefit Plans
(collectively, the " _Arrangements_ "), to certain holders of Company Shares
and holders of Company Stock Awards. The Compensation Committee of the Company
Board of Directors (the " _Company Compensation Committee_ ") (a) at a meeting
to be held prior to the Acceptance Time, will duly adopt resolutions
approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act

and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, by action
taken or authorized by the board of directors of the terminating party or
parties:

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) By either the Company or Parent, if the Offer (as it may have been
extended pursuant to  _Section 1.1_) expires as a result of the non-

the Offer pursuant to  _Section 1.1_; except that the right to terminate

occurred on or before the Outside Date; provided that neither the Company nor

been a breach by the Company of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, in each case, such that any condition
to the Offer contained in paragraphs (c)(ii) or (c)(iii) of Annex I is not
reasonably capable of being satisfied while such 

 



59  breach is continuing, (ii) Parent shall have delivered to the Company

permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(h)_ if
the Company is then in material breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

each of which shall survive termination of this Agreement); _provided_ , that,
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liabilities or damages incurred
or suffered as a result of a willful and material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement prior to such termination.

 

7.3 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ or  _Section 7.1(f)_, then the Company shall
pay to Parent prior to or concurrently with such termination, in the case of a
termination by the Company, or within two Business Days thereafter, in the
case of a termination by Parent, the Termination Fee. The " _Termination Fee_
" means $6,120,000.

(b) The parties hereto agree that if (x) this Agreement is terminated by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ or by

announced publicly or made to the Company after the date hereof, and (z) the
Company enters into a Company Acquisition Agreement or consummates an
Acquisition Proposal within twelve months after such

 



60  termination, then the Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent on the
earlier of the date of entry into such Company Acquisition Agreement or

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails
to pay the Termination Fee when due, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a Proceeding that results in a judgment against the
Company for the Termination Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent, together
with the Termination Fee, (i) interest on the Termination Fee from the date of
termination of this Agreement at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate and
(ii) Parents costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in
connection with such Proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b)
waive any breach of the representations and warranties of the other contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance
by the other with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

 



75 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 8.12(c)_.

 

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
specific performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have
jurisdiction, any state or Federal Court of the United States of America, or
any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity, (b) the parties waive any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the
obtaining of any specific performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties
will waive, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of
a remedy at Law. The Companys or Parents pursuit of specific performance at
any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to
pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled.
