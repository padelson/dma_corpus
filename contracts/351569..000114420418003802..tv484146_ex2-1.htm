been issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, without
interest and less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment, if any. Each share of HSB Common Stock subject to any HSB

(b) _HSB Stock Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, HSB shall
take all actions necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each HSB
Stock Option, whether or not then exercisable, shall fully vest and
immediately be cancelled and only entitle the holder thereof, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to receive an amount in cash,
without interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of
HSB Common Stock subject to such HSB Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration Price over (B) the per share
exercise price for the applicable HSB Stock Option, less applicable Taxes
required to be withheld with respect to such payment, if any. ABCB shall pay
such cash amount to the holder of each such HSB Stock Option promptly after
the Effective Time. Any HSB Stock Option that has a per share exercise price
that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration Price shall be
cancelled for no consideration. Each HSB Stock Option has been amended to
the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of this _Section 2.8(b)_ ,
except as set forth on HSB Disclosure Schedule _Section 2.8(b)_ , and HSB
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, prior to the Closing, the
amendment of those HSB Stock Options that have not been so amended as of the
date hereof.

  



  

(c) _HSB Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each HSB Warrant
(subject to the amendment of such HSB Warrant consistent with this
_Section 2.8(c)_ ) shall immediately be cancelled and only entitle the holder
thereof, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of HSB Common Stock subject to such HSB Warrant
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration Price
over (B) the per share exercise price for the applicable HSB Warrant. ABCB
shall pay such cash amount to the holder of each such HSB Warrant immediately
after the Effective Time. Any HSB Warrant that has a per share exercise price
that is greater than or equal to the Merger Consideration Price shall be
cancelled for no consideration. Each HSB Warrant has been amended to the
extent necessary to comply with the provisions of this _Section 2.8(c)_ ,
except as set forth on _HSB Disclosure Schedule Section 2.8(c)_ , and HSB
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause, prior to the Closing, the
amendment of those HSB Warrants that have not been so amended as of the date
hereof.

2.9 _Exchange of HSB Common Stock_.

  



  

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Closing, ABCB shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with ABCB's transfer agent or an
unrelated bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to HSB (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of HSB Common Stock, HSB
Restricted Stock Units and HSB Warrants, for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_ , through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash and ABCB Common
Stock to make all deliveries of cash and ABCB Common Stock as required by
this _Article II_ , including the Merger Consideration, pursuant to an
exchange agent agreement between ABCB and the Exchange Agent in a form
reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto (the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_
"). ABCB agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as
needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant
to _Section 2.9(c)_ and to make payments in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_. Any cash and ABCB Common Stock deposited with
the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any dividends or other
distributions in accordance with _Section 2.9(c)_ and fractional shares in
accordance with _Section 2.9(d)_ ) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
shares of HSB Common Stock, HSB Restricted Stock Units and HSB Warrants
pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by ABCB, _provided_
that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of shares of HSB Common Stock, HSB
Restricted Stock Units and HSB Warrants. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to ABCB. Except as contemplated
by this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than one (1) Business Day thereafter), ABCB shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of an
outstanding Certificate or Book Entry Share that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented shares of HSB Common Stock (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form as directed by ABCB and reasonably acceptable
to HSB (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the shares of HSB Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the corresponding certificates (the " _Certificates_
") representing such shares to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange
Agent of an "agent's message" with respect to non-certificated shares
represented by book entry (" _Book Entry Shares_ ")), and (B) instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares
in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of
HSB Common Stock represented thereby (collectively, the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ").

  



  

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates or Book Entry Shares for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with, in each case, a properly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents as may
be required pursuant to the exchange instructions, the holders of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, the Merger Consideration, including any cash payable in lieu of any
fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_. No
interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of HSB Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of HSB, the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of HSB Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of HSB Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the
Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of
the delivery of the Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not
payable.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) Immediately after the Effective Time, the holders of the HSB
Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
the Merger Consideration, as provided in _Section 2.8(a)_ , including any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock pursuant to
_Section 2.9(d)_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged HSB Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to ABCB
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to
the ABCB Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book Entry Share in
accordance with this _Section 2.9_. Subject to Applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book Entry Share, there shall be paid to
such holder of ABCB Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.9(d)_ and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such holder's whole shares of ABCB Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such holder's whole shares of ABCB Common Stock.

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or ABCB Common
Stock representing fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock or book entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares, or with respect to HSB Restricted Stock
Units, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or interest shall relate
to any such fractional share and such fractional share shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to have any rights as a holder of any ABCB Common
Stock. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of HSB Common Stock exchanged, and each holder of HSB Restricted
Stock Units cancelled and converted, in the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of ABCB Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates and Book Entry Shares delivered by such
holder and all HSB Restricted Stock Units held by such holder and cancelled
and converted in the Merger) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount, rounded to the nearest whole cent, equal to the
product of (i) the Average ABCB Closing Stock Price and (ii) the fraction of
a share (after taking into account all shares of HSB Common Stock and all HSB
Restricted Stock Units cancelled and converted in the Merger, in each case,
held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to three decimal places)
of ABCB Common Stock that such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.7_ or _Section 2.8(a)_.

  



    

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of HSB Common Stock after
one (1) year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to ABCB upon
demand and, from and after such delivery to ABCB, any former holders of HSB
Common Stock (other than Appraisal Shares) who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to ABCB for the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of such shares of HSB Common Stock. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of HSB Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, thereupon become the property of ABCB free and
clear of any Liens, claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Neither ABCB nor any of ABCB's Subsidiaries
shall be liable to any holder of shares of HSB Common Stock or HSB Restricted
Stock Units for any shares of ABCB Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official or Governmental Authority in the reasonable belief that such delivery
was required pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and
substance acceptable to ABCB and, if required by ABCB, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as ABCB may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of HSB Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

  



  

(h) _Withholding_. Each of ABCB and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of HSB Common Stock or HSB
Restricted Stock Units such amounts as ABCB or the Exchange Agent is required
to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by ABCB or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of HSB Common Stock or HSB Restricted Stock Units in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by ABCB or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

(i) _Book Entry_. All shares of ABCB Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger shall be issued in book entry form, without physical certificates.

  



  

2.10 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and
at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of ABCB
Common Stock or HSB Common Stock are changed into a different number of
shares or type of securities by reason of any stock split, stock combination,
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction with
respect to such stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, then the Per Share Stock Consideration and the Per Share Cash
Consideration will be proportionately adjusted as necessary to provide to the
holders thereof, and the holders of the HSB Restricted Stock Units, the HSB
Stock Options and the HSB Warrants, the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such adjustment event.

2.11 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in HSB Common
Stock_. At the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of HSB shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of HSB Common Stock on the records of HSB, except for the cancellation
of such shares in connection with the Merger. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book Entry Shares that evidenced
ownership of shares of HSB Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by Applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, bona fide Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

  



  

2.12 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of HSB Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by an
HSB Shareholder who did not vote in favor of the Merger (or consent thereto
in writing) and who is entitled to demand and properly demands the fair value
of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of Sections 14-2-1321 and 14-2-1323 of the GBCC (collectively, the
" _Appraisal Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. Such HSB Shareholders instead shall
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such shares held by them
in accordance with Sections 14-2-1301 to 14-2-1332 of the GBCC, except that
all Appraisal Shares held by HSB Shareholders who shall have failed to perfect
or who effectively shall have withdrawn or otherwise lost their rights as
dissenting shareholders under the GBCC shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for
the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.7_. HSB shall give ABCB (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for payment of fair value of any shares of HSB Common Stock,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the GBCC and received by HSB relating to shareholders'
dissenters' rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands under the GBCC
consistent with the obligations of HSB thereunder. HSB shall not, except with
the prior written consent of ABCB, make any payment with respect to such
demand, offer to settle or settle any demand for payment of fair value or
waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for payment of fair value
or timely take any other action to perfect payment of fair value rights in
accordance with the GBCC. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent to pay for shares of HSB Common Stock
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to ABCB upon
demand.

2.13 _Proxy and Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a) ABCB and HSB shall prepare the Registration Statement on Form
S-4 or other applicable form, which ABCB shall file with the SEC as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and which will
include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. HSB shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and deliver to ABCB for review, as promptly as
practicable following the date of this Agreement or as subsequently requested
by ABCB, such financial statements and related analysis of HSB,
including Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations of HSB, as may be required in order to file, in
compliance with Applicable Laws, the Registration Statement and any other
report or registration statement required to be filed by ABCB with the SEC.
Each of ABCB and HSB shall use commercially reasonably efforts to have the
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the
Registration Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by
the Bank Merger Agreement. Each of HSB and ABCB will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be filed with the SEC and mailed to the HSB
Shareholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. ABCB shall also
take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities
Laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of ABCB Common Stock in
the Merger, and HSB shall furnish all information concerning HSB and the
holders of HSB Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest therein, as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

  



  

(b) ABCB will advise HSB promptly after it receives oral or written
notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of ABCB Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide HSB
with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission.

  



  

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to ABCB or HSB, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by ABCB or HSB which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the HSB Shareholders.

  



  

2.14 _HSB Shareholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) HSB shall take all action necessary in accordance with
Applicable Laws and HSB's current Charter Documents to duly give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of the HSB Shareholders (including any adjournment
or postponement thereof, the " _HSB Shareholders ' Meeting_"), to be held as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act, for the purpose of obtaining the HSB Shareholder
Approval. The board of directors of HSB has resolved to recommend to the HSB
Shareholders that they approve this Agreement and HSB shall, acting through
its board of directors, (i) recommend that the HSB Shareholders approve this
Agreement (the " _HSB Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the HSB Recommendation
in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from the HSB Shareholders proxies in favor of the approval
of this Agreement, including by communicating to the HSB Shareholders the
recommendation of the board of directors of HSB that they approve this
Agreement, and to take all other commercially reasonable actions necessary or
advisable to secure the vote or consent of the HSB Shareholders required by
Applicable Law to obtain such approvals, except to the extent HSB's board of
directors has withdrawn the HSB Recommendation in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Except with the prior approval of ABCB, no other matters
shall be submitted for the approval of the HSB Shareholders at the HSB
Shareholders' Meeting.

  



    

 | 21| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Neither HSB's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall
(x) except as expressly permitted by this _Section 2.14(b)_ , withdraw,
qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to ABCB or any of ABCB's Subsidiaries, the HSB Recommendation or (y)
approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal (each, an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, HSB's board of directors
may at any time prior to the HSB Shareholders' Meeting (i) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, if and only if:

  



  

(i) HSB's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, that it has received an unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal
(that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.8_ ) that constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal that has not been
withdrawn;

  



  

(ii) HSB's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with such outside legal counsel, that it is reasonably
necessary to take such actions to comply with its fiduciary duties to HSB and
its shareholders under Applicable Law;

  



  

(iii) HSB's board of directors provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") to ABCB of its receipt of the Acquisition Proposal
and its intent to withdraw the HSB Recommendation on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that any amendment (and each successive
amendment) to any term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Recommendation Change);

  



  

(iv) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, HSB shall
negotiate in good faith with ABCB (if requested by ABCB) and provide ABCB
reasonable opportunity during the subsequent five (5)-Business Day period(s)
to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as
would enable HSB's board of directors to proceed without withdrawing the HSB
Recommendation; _provided, however_, that ABCB shall not be required to
propose any such adjustments; and

  



  

(v) HSB's board of directors, following the final such five
(5)-Business Day period, again determines in good faith, after consultation
with such outside legal counsel and such independent financial advisor, that
such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless constitutes a Superior Proposal and
that taking such action is reasonably necessary to comply with their fiduciary
duties to HSB and its shareholders under Applicable Law.

  



    

 | 22| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 2.14_ shall prohibit HSB or
the board of directors of HSB from complying with HSB's obligations required
under Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than a
"stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the board of directors of HSB reaffirms the HSB
Recommendation in such disclosure.

  



  

2.15 _Closing Deliveries by HSB_. At the Closing, HSB shall deliver

Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, have been duly and validly approved
by the board of directors (or comparable governing body) of HSB and each
applicable Subsidiary. Subject to the receipt of the HSB Shareholder Approval,
no other corporate proceedings on the part of HSB are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by the

will be, duly executed and delivered by HSB and Hamilton, as applicable, and
constitutes or, in the case of the Bank Merger Agreement, will constitute (in
each case assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by ABCB and
Ameris, as applicable) the legal, valid and binding obligations of HSB and
Hamilton enforceable against HSB and Hamilton, as applicable, in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
Applicable Laws related to safety and soundness of insured depository
institutions as set forth in 12 U.S.C. §1818(b), the appointment of a
conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

  



  

(b) HSB and its Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable actions by
them in order to exempt this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from the requirements of any
"moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction," "anti-
greenmail," "business combination" or other antitakeover Laws of the State of
Georgia to the extent such antitakeover Laws are applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. HSB and its Subsidiaries have
taken all action required to be taken by them in order to make this
Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby comply with, and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby do comply with, the requirements of any provisions of their respective
Charter Documents concerning "business combination," "fair price," "voting
requirement," "constituency requirement" or other related provisions.

3.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by HSB and of the Bank Merger Agreement by Hamilton, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by HSB and
its Subsidiaries, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, do not and will
not (i) conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of or default under,
any terms or conditions of the Charter Documents of HSB or any of its

material default) under, or give to others any rights of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation pursuant to, any HSB Material
Contract, except as set forth on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.4_ , or (C)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the assets of HSB
or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

3.5 _Consents and Approvals_. Other than (i) the Regulatory
Approvals, (ii) the HSB Shareholder Approval and (iii) such other filings,
authorizations, consents, notices or approvals as may be set forth on _HSB
Disclosure Schedule 3.5_ , no consents, approvals, authorizations or other
actions by, or filings with or notifications to, any Person or any
Governmental Authority on the part of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries are
required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by HSB of
this Agreement or by Hamilton of the Bank Merger Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

3.6 _Regulatory Matters_. HSB and each of its Subsidiaries have
timely filed all material reports, registrations and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was
required to file since January 1, 2015 with, as applicable, (i) the Federal
Reserve Board, (ii) the FDIC, (iii) the GDBF and (iv) any other applicable
bank regulatory agencies (collectively, the " _HSB Regulatory Agencies_ "),
and any other applicable Governmental Authority, and have paid all
applicable fees, premiums and assessments due and payable thereto. Each such
report, registration and statement, including financial statements, exhibits
and schedules thereto, complied, in all material respects, with Applicable
Law. Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-
desist or other formal or informal order or enforcement action issued by, or

Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2012 by any HSB Regulatory Agency
or other Governmental Authority that it is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering or requesting any such HSB Regulatory Agreement. There is no material
unresolved written violation, criticism, comment or exception by any HSB
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority relating to HSB or any of
its Subsidiaries, to HSB's Knowledge, and HSB is not aware of any reason
attributable to HSB or Hamilton why all required Regulatory Approvals would
not be received on a timely basis without undue delay and without the
imposition of any Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition as described in
the proviso to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_.

3.7 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of HSB consists only of (i)
80,000,000 shares of Voting Common Stock, of which 34,702,329 are issued
and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) 20,000,000 shares of
Non-Voting Common Stock, of which 5,723,226 shares are issued and outstanding
as of the date of this Agreement, and (iii) 20,000,000 shares of preferred
stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which no shares are issued and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.7(a)_
sets forth the name and address, as reflected on the books and records of
HSB, of each HSB Shareholder and the number of shares of Voting Common Stock
and Non-Voting Common Stock held by each such HSB Shareholder. Such issued and
outstanding shares of HSB Common Stock constitute all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of HSB as of the date of this Agreement, and have
been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
None of the shares of HSB Common Stock have been issued or disposed of
in violation of any preemptive rights of any Person. As of the date of this
Agreement, 4,250,000 shares of Voting Common Stock were reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of outstanding HSB Stock Options and for issuance upon the
vesting and settlement of outstanding Restricted Stock Units and 547,667
shares of Voting Common Stock were available for future grants of equity
awards under the HSB Incentive Plan. HSB has furnished to ABCB a true,
complete copy of the HSB Incentive Plan. Except as disclosed on _HSB
Disclosure Schedule 3.7(a)_ , as of the date of this Agreement, no trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries
are issued or outstanding, and HSB currently has no election in effect to
defer interest payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or
related debentures issued by it or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(b) _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.7(b)_ sets forth the following for
each grant or award of HSB Stock Options, HSB Restricted Stock Units, HSB
Warrants or other outstanding rights, plans, options, warrants, calls,
conversion rights or other arrangements or commitments that obligate HSB or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue or dispose of any of its capital stock or
other ownership interests: (i) the name of the grantee; (ii) the date of the
grant; (iii) the expiration date; (iv) the vesting schedule; (v) the exercise
price; (vi) the number of shares of HSB Common Stock, or any other security
of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries, subject to such award; and (vii) the
number of shares subject to such award that are exercisable or have vested as
of the date of this Agreement. Except as set forth on _HSB Disclosure
Schedule 3.7(b)_ , all shares of HSB Common Stock issuable upon exercise (or
settlement, as applicable) of HSB Stock Options, HSB Restricted Stock Units
and HSB Warrants, upon their issuance on the terms and conditions specified
in the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive
rights and will not be issued in violation of preemptive rights or any Law.
Each grant of HSB Stock Options, HSB Restricted Stock Units and HSB Warrants
was appropriately authorized by the board of directors of HSB or the
compensation committee thereof, was made in accordance with the terms of the
HSB Incentive Plan (other than the HSB Warrants) and any Applicable Law
and has a grant date identical to (or later than) the date on which it was
actually granted or awarded. The per share exercise price of each HSB Stock
Option was determined in accordance with the HSB Incentive Plan and was not
less than the fair market value of a share of HSB Common Stock on the
applicable date on which the related grant was by its terms to be effective.

(c) Except as disclosed on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.7(b)_ , there
are no outstanding (i) rights, plans, options, warrants, calls, conversion
rights or any agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind or character
(either firm or conditional) obligating HSB or any of its Affiliates to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be delivered or sold, any capital stock of
HSB or any of its Subsidiaries, or any securities exchangeable for or
convertible into the capital stock of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) contractual obligations of HSB or any of its Affiliates, or rights of a
Person, to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital
stock of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) proxies, voting agreements,
voting trusts, preemptive rights, rights of first refusal, rights of first
offer, rights of co-sale or tag-along rights, shareholder agreements or other
rights, understandings or arrangements regarding the voting or disposition of
the shares of HSB Common Stock or capital stock of its Subsidiaries (other
than the Voting Agreement and the Stockholders' Agreement). No bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on any
matters on which the holders of capital stock may vote have been issued by HSB
or any of its Subsidiaries and are outstanding.

  



  

(d) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Hamilton are, on the date of this Agreement, and on the Closing Date will be,
held by HSB.

  



  

(e) No Subsidiary of HSB owns any capital stock of HSB except for
shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in respect of a debt
previously contracted.

  



  

3.8 _Deposits_. The deposit accounts of Hamilton are insured by the
FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been duly,
timely and fully paid. No proceedings for the revocation or termination of
such deposit insurance are pending or, to HSB's Knowledge, threatened.

  



  

3.9 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) HSB has previously delivered or made available to ABCB copies of
HSB's (i) audited consolidated financial statements (including the related
notes and schedules thereto) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and
2014, accompanied by the unqualified audit reports of Crowe Horwath LLP (for
the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015) and KPMG LLP (for the year ended
December 31, 2014), independent registered accountants (collectively, the "
_Audited Financial Statements_ "), and (ii) unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements for the nine (9) months ended the Interim Balance Sheet
Date (the " _Unaudited Financial Statements_ " and, together with the Audited
Financial Statements, the " _HSB Financial Statements_ "). The HSB Financial
Statements (including any related notes and schedules thereto) are accurate
and complete in all material respects and fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition and the results of operations, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows of HSB and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such
financial statements, all in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied,
except as indicated in such statements or in the notes therein and subject,
in the case of the Unaudited Financial Statements, to normal, recurring year-
end adjustments (the effect of which has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect) and the absence of notes and schedules (that, if presented, would not
differ materially from those included in the Audited Financial Statements).
No financial statements of any entity or enterprise other than the
Subsidiaries of HSB are required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
financial statements of HSB. The audits of HSB have been conducted in
accordance with GAAP. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, neither HSB nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be
set forth on its consolidated balance sheet except for liabilities reflected
or reserved against in the HSB Financial Statements and current liabilities
incurred in ordinary course of business since the Interim Balance Sheet Date.
True, correct and complete copies of the HSB Financial Statements are attached
as _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.9(a)_.

(b) The records, systems, controls, data and information of HSB and
its Subsidiaries are in all material respects recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or
photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of HSB or its Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom), except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the system of internal
account controls described in the following sentence. HSB and its Subsidiaries
have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP.
HSB has disclosed based on its most recent evaluations, to its outside
auditors and the audit committee of HSB's board of directors (i) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely
to adversely affect HSB's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in HSB's internal
control over financial reporting.

  



  

(c) Since January 1, 2014, neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to HSB's Knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant
or representative of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or
claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of HSB or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that HSB or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices.

  



  

3.10 _Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses_. HSB's allowance for loan
and lease losses as reflected in each of (i) the latest balance
sheet included in the Audited Financial Statements and (ii) the balance sheet
as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date included in the Unaudited Financial
Statements, were, in the opinion of management, as of each of the dates
thereof, in compliance with HSB's and Hamilton's existing methodology for
determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan and lease losses and the
currently applicable standards established by applicable Governmental
Authority, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and GAAP.

3.11 _Ordinary Course; Lack of Material Adverse Change_. Since the
Balance Sheet Date, except as disclosed on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.11_  or
as otherwise specifically provided by this Agreement, HSB and its Subsidiaries
have operated in all material respects in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and there has not been any Material Adverse
Change in HSB or any of its Subsidiaries or any event, change, occurrence,
effect or development that would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on HSB or any of its Subsidiaries. During the period from the
Interim Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, except as
disclosed on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.11_ or as otherwise specifically
provided by this Agreement, there has not been any action taken by HSB or any
of its Subsidiaries that would have required ABCB's consent if HSB had been
subject to _Section 5.1_ at such time.

  



  

3.12 _Reorganization_. Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action, nor are they aware of any fact or circumstance, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

3.13 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) (i) All federal and state Tax Returns and all other material Tax
Returns that were or are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date
by HSB or its Subsidiaries have been or will be timely filed on or before the
Closing Date, and all such Tax Returns are or will be true, correct and
complete in all material respects and were or will be prepared in substantial
compliance with all Applicable Laws; (ii) all Taxes due and owing by HSB or
its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on the Tax Returns referred to in
clause (i)) have been or will be timely paid in full on or before the Closing
Date; (iii) all deficiencies asserted in writing or assessments made in
writing by the relevant Taxing Authority in connection with any of the Tax

or before the Closing Date; and (iv) no issues that have been raised in
writing by the relevant Taxing Authority in connection with any of the Tax
Returns referred to in clause (i) are pending as of the date of this
Agreement, or, if pending, have been specifically identified by HSB to ABCB
in writing and adequately reserved for in the HSB Financial
Statements. Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return.

  



  

(b) No Tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are
pending or being conducted with respect to HSB or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither HSB nor its Subsidiaries has received from any Taxing
Authority (including jurisdictions where HSB or its Subsidiaries have not
filed Tax Returns) any (i) written notice indicating an intent to open an
audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters or
(iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax
proposed, asserted or assessed by any Taxing Authority against HSB or any of
its Subsidiaries. HSB has provided ABCB with correct and complete copies of
all federal and state income Tax Returns filed by HSB and each of its
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2014 and all
examination reports and statements of deficiencies related to federal and
state income Tax assessed against or agreed to by HSB or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to those taxable periods.

  



  

(c) There are no Liens on HSB's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets
that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax
other than Permitted Liens or Liens the validity of which is being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate accruals or
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP in the HSB Financial
Statements.

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute
of limitations in respect of income Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to an income Tax assessment or deficiency.

  



  

(e) HSB and its Subsidiaries have withheld and timely paid all Taxes
required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid
or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor, shareholder or
other third party.

  



  

(f) Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries is (or has been) a
party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement (other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among HSB and its
Subsidiaries). Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a
member of an Affiliated Group filing a consolidated federal Tax Return (other
than a group the common parent of which was HSB) or (ii) has any liability
for Taxes of any Person (other than HSB or any of its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law) as a transferee, successor, by contract or
otherwise.

  



  

(g) No claim has been made in the last five (5) years by a Taxing
Authority in a jurisdiction where HSB or any Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns that HSB (or such Subsidiary) is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction.

  



  

(h) Except as listed on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.13(h)_ , neither
HSB nor any Subsidiary has, in the last five (5) years, distributed stock of
another corporation, or had its stock distributed by another corporation, in a
transaction that was purported or intended to be governed in whole or in part
by Section 355 or 361 of the Code.

  



  

(i) Neither HSB nor any Subsidiary is or has been a United States
real property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of
the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Code.

  



  

(j) Neither HSB nor any Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction
that, as of the date hereof, is a "listed transaction" under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). HSB and each Subsidiary have disclosed in
their Tax Returns all information required by the provisions of the Treasury
Regulations issued under Section 6011 of the Code with respect to any
"reportable transaction" as that term is defined in Section 6707A(c) of the
Code.

  



  

(k) Except as listed on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.13(k)_ , neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in the payment
of any amount that would not be deductible by reason of Sections 280G (as
determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) (or any corresponding
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law)), 162 (other than 162(a)) or
404 of the Code.

  



  

(l) The unpaid Taxes of HSB and each Subsidiary (i) did not, as of
the Interim Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (other
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the HSB Financial
Statements (rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of HSB and each Subsidiary in
filing its Tax Returns. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, neither HSB nor
any Subsidiary has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from
extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice.

leasehold interests in or otherwise legally enforceable rights to use all of
the real property, personal property and other assets (tangible or

with its business as presently conducted, in each case, free and clear of any
Lien, except for Permitted Liens. Except as set forth on _HSB Disclosure

material legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceeding, claim, action
or governmental or regulatory investigation of any nature with respect to the
real property that HSB or any of its Subsidiaries owns, uses or occupies or

and neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries has received a written notice of,
and otherwise has no Knowledge of any, termination or material default

exists that would constitute a termination event or a material breach by HSB
or any of its Subsidiaries of, or material default by HSB or any of its
Subsidiaries in, the performance of any covenant, agreement or condition
contained in any Lease. To HSB's Knowledge, no lessor under a Lease is in
material breach or default in the performance of any material covenant,
agreement or condition contained in such Lease. HSB and its Subsidiaries have
paid all rents and other charges to the extent due under the Leases. True and

respects; and (ii) HSB and its Subsidiaries have properly fulfilled their

director or other Affiliate of HSB on which the borrower is paying a rate
other than that reflected in the note or the relevant credit agreement. All
such Loans are and were made in compliance in all material respects with all
Applicable Laws. Each Loan disclosed on _HSB Disclosure Schedule 3.17(g)_

loss with respect to any such securities sold during such time period after
the Interim Balance Sheet Date. Each of HSB and its Subsidiaries has good,
valid and marketable title to all securities held by it, except securities
sold under repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency
capacity, free and clear of any Lien. Neither HSB nor any of its Subsidiaries
owns any of the outstanding equity of any savings bank, savings and loan
association, savings and loan holding company, credit union, bank or bank
holding company, insurance company, mortgage or loan broker or any other
financial institution other than Hamilton.

Intellectual Property constitutes all of the Intellectual Property necessary
to carry on the business of HSB and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.
The HSB Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable and has not been

4.3 _Authority; Binding Nature_. Each of ABCB and, to the extent
applicable, its Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement and to carry out its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
by ABCB and by Ameris of the Bank Merger Agreement, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly and validly
approved by the board of directors of ABCB and Ameris. No other corporate
proceedings on the part of ABCB are necessary to authorize this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Bank Merger
Agreement. This Agreement has been, and the Bank Merger Agreement will be,
duly executed and delivered by ABCB and Ameris, as applicable, and constitutes
or, in the case of the Bank Merger Agreement, will constitute (in each case
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by HSB and Hamilton, as
applicable) the legal, valid and binding obligations of ABCB and Ameris
enforceable against ABCB and Ameris, as applicable, in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by Applicable Laws related
to safety and soundness of insured depository institutions as set forth in 12
U.S.C. §1818(b), the appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or
in equity).

  



  

4.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by ABCB and of the Bank Merger Agreement by Ameris, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by ABCB and
its Subsidiaries, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, do not and will
not (i) conflict with, or result in a breach of or default under, any terms or
conditions of the Charter Documents of ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries or
(ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in _Section 4.5_
hereof are duly obtained, (A) conflict with or violate in any material
respect any Applicable Law as to ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) result
in any material breach of, or constitute a material default (or event which
with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a material
default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment,
acceleration or cancellation pursuant to any Contract set forth on the
"Exhibit Index" included in ABCB's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2016 or the ABCB SEC filings subsequently filed or (C) result in the creation
or imposition of any Lien on any of the assets of ABCB or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  



  

4.5 _Consents and Approvals_. Other than the Regulatory Approvals,
no consents, approvals, authorizations or other actions by, or filings with
or notifications to, any Person or any Governmental Authority on the part of
ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries is required in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by ABCB or by Ameris of the Bank
Merger Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby.

  



    

 | 43| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.6 _Regulatory Matters_. ABCB and each of its Subsidiaries has
timely filed all material reports, registrations and statements, together
with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was
required to file since January 1, 2015 with, as applicable, (i) the Federal
Reserve Board, (ii) the FDIC, (iii) the GDBF and (iv) any other applicable
bank regulatory agencies (collectively, the " _ABCB Regulatory Agencies_ "
and, together with the HSB Regulatory Agencies, the " _Regulatory Agencies_
"), and any other applicable Governmental Authority, and has paid all
applicable fees, premiums and assessments due and payable thereto. Each such
report, registration and statement, including financial statements, exhibits
and schedules thereto, complied, in all material respects, with Applicable
Law. Neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-
desist or other formal or informal order or enforcement action issued by, or
is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement, operating
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter, regulatory directive or similar undertaking with, or is
subject to any capital directive by, or is currently subject to any order to
pay any civil money penalty by, or currently has in effect any board
resolutions adopted at the request of, any ABCB Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority of any kind (each, a " _ABCB Regulatory Agreement_ ").
To ABCB's Knowledge, no ABCB Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority has initiated or has pending any ABCB Regulatory
Agreement regarding or relating to ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries. There is
no material unresolved written violation, criticism, comment or exception by
any ABCB Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority relating to ABCB
or any of its Subsidiaries, to ABCB's Knowledge, and ABCB is not aware of any
reason attributable to ABCB or Ameris why it or any of its Subsidiaries would
not receive all required Regulatory Approvals on a timely basis without undue
delay and without the imposition of any Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition as described in the proviso to _Section 5.3(a)(i)_.

  



  

4.7 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of ABCB consists only of (i)
100,000,000 shares of ABCB Common Stock, of which 37,373,205 shares
were issued and outstanding as of the last trading day immediately prior to
date of this Agreement (the " _ABCB Capitalization Date_ "), and 1,475,953 of
which were held in treasury as of the ABCB Capitalization Date, and (ii)
5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which were issued and
outstanding as of the ABCB Capitalization Date. Such shares constitute all of
the issued and outstanding shares of ABCB Common Stock as of the ABCB
Capitalization Date. All of the issued and outstanding shares of ABCB Common
Stock and shares of ABCB's preferred stock have been duly authorized, validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. None of such shares have been
issued or disposed of in violation of any preemptive rights of any Person. The
ABCB Common Stock to be issued in exchange for HSB Common Stock in the
Merger, when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and will not be
subject to any preemptive rights. As of the date hereof, there are, and as of
the Effective Time there will be, sufficient authorized and unissued shares of
ABCB Common Stock to enable ABCB to issue the Merger Consideration as
contemplated in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Ameris are, on the date of this Agreement, and on the Closing Date will be,
held by ABCB.

  



    

 | 44| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Except as disclosed in the ABCB SEC Filings or _ABCB Disclosure
Schedule Section 4.7(c)_ , as of the ABCB Capitalization Date, there are no
outstanding rights, plans, options, warrants, calls, conversion rights or any
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any kind or character (either firm
or conditional) obligating ABCB or any of its Affiliates to issue, deliver or
sell, or cause to be delivered or sold, any capital stock of ABCB or its
Subsidiaries, or any securities exchangeable for or convertible into the
capital stock of ABCB or its Subsidiaries. As of the ABCB Capitalization Date,
no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on
any matters on which the holders of capital stock may vote have been issued by
ABCB and are outstanding.

  



  

4.8 _Deposits_. The deposit accounts of Ameris are insured by the
FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and all premiums
and assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been duly,
timely and fully paid. No proceedings for the revocation or termination of
such deposit insurance are pending or, to ABCB's Knowledge, threatened.

  



  

4.9 _ABCB SEC Filings_. ABCB has filed (or furnished) all
registration statements, prospectuses, forms, reports, definitive proxy
statements, schedules and documents required to be filed (or furnished) with
the SEC by it under Section 5 of the Securities Act or Sections 13(a), 14 or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, as the case may be, from and after January 1, 2015
(collectively, the " _ABCB SEC Filings_ "). Each ABCB SEC Filing, as amended
or supplemented if applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not,
at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

  



  

4.10 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The financial statements of ABCB and its Subsidiaries included
(or incorporated by reference) in the ABCB SEC Filings, including the related
notes, where applicable, (i) have been prepared from, and are in accordance
with, the books and records of ABCB and its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present
in all material respects the consolidated results of operations, cash flows,
changes in shareholders' equity and consolidated financial position of ABCB
and its Subsidiaries for the respective fiscal periods or as of the
respective dates therein set forth (subject in the case of unaudited
statements to recurring year-end audit adjustments normal in nature
and amount), (iii) complied as to form, as of their respective dates of
filing with the SEC, in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto and (iv) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods involved, except, in each case, as
indicated in such statements or in the notes thereto. As of the date hereof,
the books and records of ABCB and its Subsidiaries have been maintained in
all material respects in accordance with GAAP and any other applicable legal
and accounting requirements and reflect only actual transactions. As of the
date hereof, Crowe Horwath LLP has not resigned (or informed ABCB that it
intends to resign) or been dismissed as independent public accountants of
ABCB as a result of or in connection with any disagreements with ABCB on a
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure
or auditing scope or procedure.

  



    

 | 45| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to ABCB and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or
obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent,
determined, determinable or otherwise and whether due or to become due),
except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved against on
the consolidated balance sheet of ABCB included in its Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017 (including any
notes thereto), (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent in nature and amount with past practice since
the end of such fiscal quarter or (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) The records, systems, controls, data and information of ABCB and
its Subsidiaries are in all material respects recorded, stored,
maintained and operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical or
photographic process, whether computerized or not) that are under the
exclusive ownership and direct control of ABCB or its Subsidiaries or
accountants (including all means of access thereto and therefrom). ABCB (i)
has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information
relating to ABCB, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief
executive officer and the chief financial officer of ABCB by others within
those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
ABCB's outside auditors and the audit committee of ABCB's board of directors
(A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect ABCB's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in ABCB's internal
controls over financial reporting. There is no reason to believe that ABCB's
outside auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer
will not be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant
to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

  



  

4.11 _Ordinary Course; Lack of Material Adverse Change_. Since the
Balance Sheet Date, except as reflected in the ABCB SEC Filings or as
contemplated by this Agreement, there has not been (i) any Material Adverse
Change in ABCB or any event, change, occurrence, effect or development that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ABCB or (ii)
any action taken by ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from
the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement that would have
required HSB's consent if ABCB had been subject to _Section 5.2_ at such
time.

  



  

4.12 _Reorganization_. Neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action, nor are they aware of any fact or circumstance, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



    

 | 46| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.13 _Taxes_.

  



  

(a) (i) All federal and state Tax Returns and all other material Tax
Returns that were or are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date
by ABCB or its Subsidiaries have been or will be timely filed on or before the
Closing Date, and all such Tax Returns are or will be true, correct and
complete in all material respects and were or will be prepared in substantial
compliance with all Applicable Laws; (ii) all Taxes due and owing by ABCB or
its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on the Tax Returns referred to in
clause (i)) have been or will be timely paid in full on or before the Closing
Date; (iii) all deficiencies asserted in writing or assessments made in
writing by the relevant Taxing Authority in connection with any of the Tax
Returns referred to in clause (i) have been or will be timely paid in full on
or before the Closing Date; and (iv) no issues that have been raised in
writing by the relevant Taxing Authority in connection with any of the Tax
Returns referred to in clause (i) are pending as of the date of this
Agreement, or, if pending, have been specifically identified by ABCB to HSB in
writing and adequately reserved for in the ABCB Financial Statements. Neither
ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries currently is the beneficiary of any extension
of time within which to file any Tax Return.

  



  

(b) No Tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings are
pending or being conducted with respect to ABCB or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither ABCB nor its Subsidiaries has received from any Taxing
Authority (including jurisdictions where ABCB or its Subsidiaries have not
filed Tax Returns) any (i) written notice indicating an intent to open an
audit or other review, (ii) request for information related to Tax matters or
(iii) notice of deficiency or proposed adjustment for any amount of Tax
proposed, asserted or assessed by any Taxing Authority against ABCB or any of
its Subsidiaries. ABCB has provided HSB with correct and complete copies of
all federal and state income Tax Returns filed by ABCB and each of its
Subsidiaries for taxable periods ended on or after December 31, 2014 and all
examination reports and statements of deficiency related to federal and state
income Tax assessed against or agreed to by ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to those taxable periods.

  



  

(c) There are no Liens on ABCB's or any of its Subsidiaries' assets
that arose in connection with any failure (or alleged failure) to pay any Tax
other than Permitted Liens or Liens the validity of which is being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate accruals or
reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP in the ABCB Financial
Statements.

  



  

(d) Neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute
of limitations in respect of income Taxes or agreed to any extension of time
with respect to an income Tax assessment or deficiency.

  



  

(e) ABCB and its Subsidiaries have withheld and timely paid all
Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with any
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
shareholder or other third party.

  



  

(f) Neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries is (or has been) a
party to any Tax allocation or sharing agreement (other than such an
agreement or arrangement exclusively between or among ABCB and its
Subsidiaries). Neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) has been a member
of an Affiliated Group filing a consolidated federal Tax Return (other than a
group the common parent of which was ABCB) or (ii) has any liability for
Taxes of any Person (other than ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries) under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Law) as a transferee, successor, by contract or
otherwise.

  



    

 | 47| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) No claim has been made in the last five (5) years by a Taxing
Authority in a jurisdiction where ABCB or any Subsidiary does not file Tax
Returns that ABCB (or such Subsidiary) is or may be subject to taxation by
that jurisdiction.

  



  

(h) Neither ABCB nor any Subsidiary has, in the last five (5) years,
distributed stock of another corporation, or had its stock distributed by
another corporation, in a transaction that was purported or intended to be
governed in whole or in part by Section 355 or 361 of the Code.

  



  

(i) Neither ABCB nor any Subsidiary is or has been a United States
real property holding corporation (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of
the Code) during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)
of the Code.

  



  

(j) Neither ABCB nor any Subsidiary has engaged in any transaction
that, as of the date hereof, is a "listed transaction" under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b)(2). ABCB and each Subsidiary have disclosed in
their Tax Returns all information required by the provisions of the Treasury
Regulations issued under Section 6011 of the Code with respect to any
"reportable transaction" as that term is defined in Section 6707A(c) of the
Code.

  



  

(k) The unpaid Taxes of ABCB and each Subsidiary (i) did not, as of
the Interim Balance Sheet Date, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (other
than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the ABCB Financial
Statements (rather than in any notes thereto) and (ii) will not exceed that
reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the Closing Date in
accordance with the past custom and practice of ABCB and each Subsidiary
in filing its Tax Returns. Since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, neither ABCB
nor any Subsidiary has incurred any liability for Taxes arising from
extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the
ordinary course of business consistent with past custom and practice.

  



  

4.14 _Litigation; Orders_.

  



  

(a) There is no Proceeding pending or, to ABCB's Knowledge,
threatened either (i) against ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries, or to

contemplated by this Agreement or by the Bank Merger Agreement.

  



  

(b) There is no Order either (i) outstanding against ABCB or any of
its Subsidiaries or (ii) seeking to prevent, alter or delay any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by the Bank Merger
Agreement.

(a) ABCB and each of its Subsidiaries is, and has been since January
1, 2014, in compliance in all material respects with all Applicable Laws and

Reserve Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and all agency requirements relating to
the origination, sale and servicing of mortgage and consumer loans.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) ABCB and each of its Subsidiaries have all material Permits of,
and have made all required filings, applications and registrations with, all
applicable Governmental Authorities necessary to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to carry on its business in all material respects as presently
conducted. All such material Permits are in full force and effect and, to
ABCB's Knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is threatened.

  



  

(c) Neither ABCB nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default under or
in violation of any term or provision of (i) its Charter Documents or
(ii) any material Permit which it holds.

a complete and correct copy of each such policy has been made available to
HSB. Such policies comply in all material respects with the requirements of
any Laws applicable thereto.

  



  

4.16 _Regulatory Capital; CRA Compliance_. Each of ABCB and Ameris
is, and will be upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Well-Capitalized, and Ameris's most recent examination
rating under the CRA was "satisfactory" or better. To ABCB's Knowledge, there
is no fact or circumstance or set of facts or circumstances which would be
reasonably likely to cause ABCB or Ameris to receive any notice of non-
compliance with such provisions of the CRA or cause ABCB or Ameris's CRA
rating to decrease below the "satisfactory" level.

  



  

4.17 _Material Contracts_. Each Contract which is a "material
contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of
the SEC) to which ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which ABCB
or any of its Subsidiaries is bound as of the date hereof has been filed as
an exhibit to the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed by ABCB or a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on Form 8-K subsequent
thereto. Each such Contract is valid and binding on ABCB or the
applicable Subsidiary, is in full force and effect, and neither ABCB nor any
Subsidiary of ABCB is in material violation or material default thereof.

  



  

4.18 _No Financing_. ABCB has and will have as of the Effective Time,
without having to resort to external sources, sufficient capital to effect
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

4.19 _Brokers_. Except for Stephens Inc., no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or by the Bank Merger Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of ABCB or its Subsidiaries.

  



    

 | 49| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.20 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by ABCB or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (a) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, on the date it (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is first mailed to the HSB Shareholders or
at the time of the HSB Shareholders' Meeting, (b) the Registration Statement,
when it or any amendment thereto becomes effective under the Securities Act,
or (c) the documents and financial statements of ABCB incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Registration Statement or
any amendment or supplement thereto, will contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by ABCB with respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference therein based on information
supplied by or on behalf of HSB or its Subsidiaries for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. The
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Registration Statement will, when filed by
ABCB in final form with the SEC, comply as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

  



  

4.21 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties made by ABCB in this _Article IV_ , neither
ABCB nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation or
warranty with respect to ABCB, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and HSB hereby disclaims any such other
representations or warranties. ABCB has conducted its own independent review
and analysis of the business, operations, assets, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition, technology and prospects of HSB and its
Subsidiaries, and acknowledges that ABCB has been provided sufficient access
to personnel, properties, premises and records of HSB for such purpose. In
entering into this Agreement, ABCB has relied solely upon the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement and upon its own
investigation and analysis of HSB and its Subsidiaries. Nothing set forth in
this _Section 4.21_ shall be construed to limit the obligations,
representations or warranties of HSB set forth in this Agreement.

be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which for purposes of
requesting and giving consent under this _Section 5.1_ , ABCB's and Ameris's
representative shall be either Ameris's EVP and Chief Operating Officer or
EVP and Corporate Banking Executive (or such other person or persons
designated in writing by either of them); _provided, however_ , that with
respect to _Section 5.1(xix)_ , if ABCB shall not have disapproved of HSB's

repurchase or otherwise acquire or offer to redeem, repurchase or otherwise
acquire any of its securities (other than (A) dividends paid by any of the
Subsidiaries of HSB to HSB or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries,

Agreement, each of HSB and ABCB agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to
assist and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party and its
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement and the Bank Merger
Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Bank
Merger Agreement, including: (i) obtaining all Regulatory Approvals and all
other necessary, proper or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental Authorities
(including the final consent of the FDIC to the assignment, assumption and
transfer of all purchase and assumption and related loss-share agreements,
that have not been terminated, between Hamilton and the FDIC, as receiver and
acting in its corporate capacity, to ABCB and Ameris) and making all
necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notices and
taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, waiver or
exemption from any Governmental Authority; _provided, however_,
that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require ABCB, or require or
permit HSB, to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any
condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of any Governmental Authority that (A) would
reasonably be expected to result in ABCB or Ameris becoming subject to any
material and adverse cease-and-desist order or other material and adverse
order, formal or informal enforcement action issued by, or written
agreement, consent agreement, operating agreement, memorandum of
understanding, commitment letter or similar material and adverse
undertaking with, or any request to adopt any material and adverse board

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on ABCB after giving effect to the
Merger (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any determination by any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority that the Bank Merger may not
be consummated as contemplated herein or in a substantially similar manner
immediately following the Effective Time or that any HSB Regulatory Agreement
will not terminate and be of no further force as of and following the
consummation of the Bank Merger) (any of the foregoing matters in clauses (A)
and (B), a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "); (ii) obtaining
all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals,

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ABCB and HSB
shall each use, and shall cause their applicable Subsidiaries to use,
reasonable best efforts to prepare and file any applications, notices and
filings required in order to obtain the Regulatory Approvals as promptly as
practicable (but, in any event, within thirty (30) calendar days) after the
date of this Agreement. ABCB and HSB shall each use, and shall each cause
their applicable Subsidiaries to use, reasonable best efforts to obtain each
such approval as promptly as reasonably practicable. The parties shall
cooperate with each other in connection therewith (including the furnishing of
any information and any reasonable undertaking or commitments that may be
required to obtain the Regulatory Approvals). Each party will provide the
other with copies of (i) any applications and all correspondence relating
thereto prior to filing, other than material filed in connection therewith
under a claim of confidentiality, and (ii) copies of correspondence from all
Regulatory Agencies.

  



  

(c) Subject to Applicable Law (including Applicable Law relating to
the exchange of information), the parties shall advise each other
promptly after receiving any communication from any Governmental Authority
whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Bank Merger Agreement that causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that the
Regulatory Approvals or any other consent or approval required hereunder will
not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be materially
delayed.

  



  

5.4 _Access; Current Information_.

  



  

(a) In order to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Bank Merger Agreement and the integration of
the business and operations of HSB and its Subsidiaries, subject to _Section

their respective officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized Representatives, reasonable access, throughout the period
before the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice and at ABCB's sole expense:

  



    

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(i) during customary business hours, to all books, papers and
records relating to the assets, properties, operations, obligations and
liabilities of HSB and its Subsidiaries; _provided, however_, that HSB
shall not be required to take any action that would provide access to or to
disclose information (x) where such access or disclosure would result in the
waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between it and any of
its counsel or where such access or disclosure would contravene any Applicable
Law or Order or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement or (y) relating to HSB's or its directors', officers', employees',
accountants', counsels', advisors' (including investment bankers), agents' or
other representatives' consideration of, or deliberations regarding, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, further_, that in
any such event in which the restrictions of clause (x) of this sentence apply,
the parties shall attempt to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements; and

  



  

(ii) during and, as reasonably required, outside of customary
business hours, to telecommunications, data processing and related
electronic information systems, facilities and personnel of HSB and its
Subsidiaries for the purpose of performing activities related to
the Information Systems Conversion.

  



  

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available,
and to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, HSB will furnish to ABCB
copies of the board packages distributed to the board of directors of HSB or
Hamilton, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and minutes from the
meetings thereof, and copies of any reports provided to the board of directors
of HSB or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and
risk management of HSB.

  



  

(c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, each of HSB and ABCB will cause one or more of its
designated representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives
of the other party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations
of HSB and its Subsidiaries and ABCB and its Subsidiaries, respectively.

permitted by Applicable Law, (i) a copy of each report filed by HSB or any of
its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Authority within one (1) Business Day
following the filing thereof, (ii) a copy of HSB's monthly loan trial balance
within one (1) Business Day following the end of the month and (iii) a copy of
HSB's monthly statement of condition and profit and loss statement within
five (5) Business Days following the end of the month and, if requested by
ABCB, a copy of HSB's daily statement of condition and daily profit and loss
statement, which shall be provided within two (2) Business Days following
such request.

  



  

(d) Prior to the execution of this Agreement and prior to the
consummation of the Merger, each of HSB and ABCB and their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and Representatives have provided, and will continue
to provide, one another with information, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, which may be deemed by the party providing such information to
be non-public, proprietary or confidential, including trade secrets of the
disclosing party. Each of HSB and ABCB agrees that it will, and will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives to, hold any
information obtained pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution of this
Agreement and, if this Agreement shall be terminated for any reason prior to
the Closing Date, such termination of this Agreement.

  



    

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

5.5 _Notification of Certain Changes_. HSB, on the one hand, and
ABCB, on the other, shall promptly notify the other in writing (i) if such
party believes that it has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or (ii) if such party believes that any
event shall have occurred that might reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 6.2_ or _Section 6.3_ if continuing on the Closing Date. From
time to time prior to the Effective Time (and on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Closing Date), HSB will supplement or amend the HSB Disclosure
Schedule delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to
reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
HSB Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in
such HSB Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially inaccurate
thereby. No supplement or amendment to any HSB Disclosure Schedule or
provision of information relating to the subject matter of any HSB Disclosure
Schedule after the date of this Agreement shall operate to cure any breach of
a representation or warranty made herein or have any effect for the purpose
of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_
 or compliance by HSB with its covenants and agreements set forth herein.

  



  

5.6 _Public Announcements_. HSB and ABCB shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements or filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the Bank Merger Agreement and
shall not issue, and shall not permit any of their Subsidiaries to issue, any
such press release or make any such public statement without the prior
written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided, however_, that a party may,
without the prior written consent of the other party, issue such press release
or make such public statement or filing as may be required by Applicable Law
or Order or any listing agreement with a national stock exchange or
automated quotation system.

  



  

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  



  

(a) Each employee of HSB and Hamilton shall be retained as an "at
will" employee after the Effective Time as employees of ABCB or Ameris;
_provided_ , that continued retention by Ameris of such employees subsequent
to the Effective Time shall be subject to Ameris's normal and customary
employment procedures and practices, including customary background screening
and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment performance. In
addition, HSB and Hamilton agree, upon ABCB's reasonable request, to
facilitate discussions between ABCB and HSB employees a reasonable time in
advance of the Closing Date regarding employment, consulting or other
arrangements to be effective prior to or following the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, any interaction between ABCB and HSB employees shall
be coordinated by HSB or Hamilton. As of the Closing Date, ABCB shall, or
shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to, provide to each employee of HSB or
its Subsidiaries who shall continue employment with the Surviving Corporation
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") (i) base hourly wages or salaries, as applicable, and (ii)
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements (excluding,
however, all equity plans) that until the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the HSB Employee Benefit
Plans provided to each such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

  



    

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) HSB and Hamilton employees (other than those listed in _HSB
Disclosure Schedule 5.7(b)_ who are parties to an employment, change-of-
control or other type of agreement which provides for severance) as of the
date of this Agreement who remain employed by HSB or any of its Subsidiaries
as of the Effective Time, who become employees of ABCB or Ameris at the
Effective Time and whose employment is terminated by ABCB or Ameris Bank
following the Closing Date (a " _Discontinued Employee_ ") shall be provided
by ABCB or Ameris with severance benefits under the existing severance
policies of ABCB and its Subsidiaries, a complete and correct copy of which
has been made available to HSB; _provided, however_ , that for purposes of
determining seniority as it relates to severance practices of ABCB or its
Subsidiaries, any such Discontinued Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with HSB or its Subsidiary, as applicable; and
_provided, further_, that such benefit payments shall be conditioned on
execution of a release of claims in a form satisfactory to ABCB.

  



  

(c) With respect to any ABCB Employee Benefit Plan in which any
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate on or after the
Closing Date, ABCB shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all
preexisting conditions, actively at work requirements, exclusion and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements under any such
ABCB Employee Benefit Plan to the extent they were inapplicable to, or were
satisfied under, any HSB Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated prior to the Closing Date and (ii) ensure that each
Continuing Employee receives full credit (including eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but
excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit ABCB Employee Benefit
Plan or any such credit that would result in a duplication of benefits) under
each ABCB Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee becomes or
may become a participant for service with the Surviving Corporation (or any
predecessor to the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates), solely to the
extent such service was credited under the HSB Employee Benefit Plans. As of
the Closing Date, ABCB shall, and shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to,
credit to Continuing Employees the amount of vacation time that such
employees had accrued under any vacation policy or arrangement listed on _HSB
Disclosure Schedule 3.24(a)_ as of the Closing Date. With respect to each
ABCB Employee Benefit Plan that is a health plan in which
Continuing Employees participate after Closing, ABCB shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) cause to be waived any eligibility waiting period,
any evidence of insurability requirement and the application of any pre-
existing condition limitation under such plan to the extent such requirements
or limitations were inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, any HSB Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated prior to the
Closing Date and (B) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit
under such health plan with respect to the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs (" _Closing Date Plan Year_ ") for amounts (such as deductibles
and co-payments) paid under any similar HSB Employee Benefit Plan by such
Continuing Employee, with respect to the Closing Date Plan Year and for which
verification is provided by the insurer or third-party administrator of
such HSB Employee Benefit Plan, as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of any applicable ABCB Employee
Benefit Plan.

  



    

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) ABCB and HSB acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.7_ are included for the sole benefit of ABCB and HSB and
nothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as an amendment to any HSB
Employee Benefit Plan or ABCB Employee Benefit Plan or the creation of any
new employee benefit plan, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any employee or former employee of any
of ABCB or HSB or their respective Subsidiaries, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (iii) otherwise obligate ABCB or any of its
Affiliates to maintain any particular HSB Employee Benefit Plan, ABCB
Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or retain the employment
of any particular employee following the Closing Date. ABCB and HSB further
acknowledge and agree that HSB and its Subsidiaries shall provide to ABCB all
employee books and records relating to Continuing Employees no later than the
Closing Date.

  



  

(e) If requested by ABCB, HSB shall terminate the 401(k) Plan
immediately prior to the Closing by resolution adopted by the board of
directors of HSB, on terms acceptable to ABCB, and simultaneously amend the
401(k) Plan to the extent necessary to comply with all Applicable Laws to the
extent not previously amended. HSB shall notify the 401(k) Plan participants
and beneficiaries of such termination prior to the Closing Date pursuant to
Applicable Law requirements. ABCB will permit rollover of 401(k) plan assets
by Continuing Employees to a defined contribution retirement plan with a
401(k) feature of ABCB or its Subsidiaries.

  



  

5.8 _No Solicitation of Transaction by HSB_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, or, if earlier, the
date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VII_
, HSB shall not, and shall cause all of its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any
action to solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly facilitate or encourage any
inquiries or expressions of interest or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person
(other than ABCB and its Subsidiaries) any nonpublic information or data with
respect to HSB or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition
Proposal (other than the Merger), (iv) enter into any agreement in principle,
arrangement, understanding, contract or agreement (other than a
confidentiality agreement which expressly permits HSB to comply with its
obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ ) relating to an
Acquisition Proposal (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (v) propose or agree
to do any of the foregoing. Upon execution of this Agreement, HSB shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and all of its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or
communications with any party or parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; _provided, however_, that this _Section 5.8_ shall not prohibit
HSB or any of its respective representatives from informing any Person of the
restrictions contained in this _Section 5.8_ (including by providing a copy
hereof to such Person).

  



    

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.8(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, HSB may, provided that it shall comply with the requirements of
_Section 2.14(b)_ , take any of the actions described in _Section 5.8(a)_
with respect to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
received by HSB prior to the HSB Shareholders' Meeting, which Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.8_ , if, but only
if, (i) HSB's board of directors determines in good faith (in accordance with
this Agreement and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B)
it is reasonably necessary to furnish such information or access or enter
into discussions or negotiations in order to comply with HSB's board of
directors' fiduciary duties to HSB and its shareholders under Applicable Law,
(ii) HSB has provided ABCB with at least one (1) Business Day's prior notice
of such determination and (iii) prior to furnishing or affording access to any
information or data with respect to HSB or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise relating to such Acquisition Proposal, HSB receives from such Person
a confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to HSB than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. HSB shall promptly provide to
ABCB any non-public information regarding HSB or its Subsidiaries provided to
any other Person that was not previously provided to ABCB, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

  



  

(c) HSB shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify ABCB in writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers
or proposals) are received by, any information is requested from, or any

5.9 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
ABCB shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director,
officer or employee of HSB or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnitees_ ")
in respect of all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines,
penalties costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (each a
" _Claim_ "), whenever asserted, based on or arising out the fact that the
Indemnitee was an officer, director or employee of HSB or any Subsidiary (or
fiduciary of any benefit plan of HSB or its Subsidiaries) for acts or
omissions by the Indemnitee in such capacity or taken at the request of HSB
or any Subsidiary, at or any time prior to the Effective Time (including any
Claim relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Bank
Merger Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii) assume all
obligations of HSB and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in HSB's Charter
Documents and the organizational documents of HSB's Subsidiaries. In
addition, ABCB, from and after the Effective Time, shall advance any expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) of any Indemnitee under this _Section
5.9_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
_provided_ that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides

(b) ABCB shall maintain in effect for six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by HSB ( _provided_ that ABCB may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to such officers and directors so
long as substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided,
however_, that in no event shall ABCB be required to expend annually in the
aggregate an amount in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual
premium payment on HSB's current policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Premium Cap_ ") and, in the event the cost of such coverage
shall exceed that amount, ABCB shall purchase as much coverage as possible for
such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, ABCB may obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a prepaid "tail" policy providing coverage equivalent to that
described in the preceding sentence for an aggregate price of no more than the
Premium Cap.

  



  

(c) Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
5.9(a)_ shall promptly notify ABCB in writing upon learning of any Claim,
_provided_ that failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of ABCB
under _Section 5.9(b)_ unless, and to the extent that, ABCB is materially
prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the event of any
such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) ABCB
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and ABCB shall not be
liable to such Indemnitees for any legal expenses of other counsel or any
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnitees in connection with
the defense thereof; _provided, however_ , that ABCB shall not have the right
to assume the defense thereof (but will be apprised of the status of such
defense) if ABCB's interests may materially conflict with the
Indemnitees' interests with respect to such Claim, in which case ABCB shall
continue to be liable to such Indemnitees for legal expenses of other counsel
and other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnitees (provided that ABCB
shall only be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one such
counsel, which shall be reasonably acceptable to ABCB); (ii) the Indemnitees
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter in good faith; (iii) ABCB
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); (iv) ABCB shall have no obligation hereunder in the
event that a federal or state banking agency or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an Indemnitee in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by Applicable Law; and (v) without
the prior written consent of the applicable Indemnitee (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), ABCB shall not settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any such Claim
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnitee for all liability arising out of
such Claim.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any Indemnitee
may have under HSB Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. In the event
ABCB or any of its successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of ABCB or the purchaser of its assets and properties shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. This _Section 5.9_
shall survive the Effective Time.

Consideration equals the lesser of the following: (1) an amount equal to the
product of the Starting Price, 0.85 and the Exchange Ratio (as in effect
immediately before any increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this

Ratio, 0.85, the Exchange Ratio (as in effect immediately before any increase
in the Exchange Ratio pursuant to this _Section 7.1(h)_ ) and the

If ABCB so elects within such three (3) Business Day period, then it shall
give prompt written notice to HSB of such election and the revised Exchange
Ratio or the Additional Cash Payment Per Share, as applicable, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this _Section 7.1(h)_ and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms, provided that
any references in this Agreement to the "Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be
deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as increased pursuant to this _Section
7.1(h)_ , if applicable, and any references in this Agreement to the Merger
Consideration shall thereafter include the Additional Cash Payment Per Share
as set forth in this _Section 7.1(h)_ , if applicable.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by a party
pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , written notice thereof shall promptly be given
to the other party hereto, and upon such notice this Agreement shall
terminate. Except as provided under this _Section 7.2_ or otherwise
expressly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, upon termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and of no further force and effect, there shall be no
liability on the part of any party hereto to the other party, and all rights
and obligations of any party hereto shall cease and the parties shall be
released from any and all obligations hereunder; _provided, however_, that
(i) the provisions of _Section 5.4(d)_ , this _Section 7.2_ and _Article

relieve any party from liability for damages resulting from fraud or the
willful breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_
, then HSB shall, within three (3) Business Days of such termination, pay to
ABCB the sum of $14,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
the event that (i) an Acquisition Proposal with respect to HSB shall have been
communicated to or otherwise made known to the shareholders, senior
management or board of directors of HSB, or any Person or group of
Persons shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to HSB after the
date of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by
ABCB pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ or (B) by ABCB or HSB pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ and (iii) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date
of such termination HSB consummates a transaction of a type set forth in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" or enters into an Acquisition Agreement,
then HSB shall, on the earlier of the date such transaction is consummated or
any such Acquisition Agreement is entered into, pay to ABCB the Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

  



  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if HSB fails to pay timely any Termination Fee
payable by it pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , then HSB shall pay to ABCB its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with collecting such Termination Fee, together with interest on
the amount of the fee at the prime annual rate of interest (as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus two percent (2%) as the same is in effect
from time to time from the date such payment was due under this Agreement
until the date of payment.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
other than in connection with fraud or a willful and material breach of this
Agreement, the payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2_
shall fully discharge HSB from, and be the sole and exclusive remedy of ABCB
with respect to, any and all losses that may be suffered by ABCB based upon,
resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to the
termination of this Agreement. In no event shall HSB be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

8.4 _Waivers_. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising,
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement shall operate as a
waiver, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege hereunder preclude the exercise of any other right, power or

remedies under this Agreement or otherwise afforded by Applicable Law to
any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative. Without limiting the
rights of a party hereto to pursue all other legal and equitable rights
available to such party for another party's failure to perform its obligations
under this Agreement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
remedy at law for any failure to perform their respective obligations
hereunder would be inadequate and that each party shall be entitled to
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the
event of any such failure. Each of the parties hereby further waives any
requirement under Applicable Law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

, each party to this Agreement shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the Bank Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, whether or not such transactions are consummated, including all fees
and expenses of such party's Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Party in accordance
with its terms due to a failure to obtain any Regulatory Approval from a
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (provided that such failure is not primarily
related to the financial or regulatory condition of HSB or any of its
Subsidiaries) or due to a failure by ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries to
satisfy any condition contained in any such Regulatory Approval, then ABCB
shall pay HSB $1,500,000 as reimbursement for its internal and external
transaction-related costs and expenses. Such payment shall be made within one
(1) Business Day after such termination event by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified by HSB.

recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, including attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in litigating entitlement to attorneys' fees and costs and
in determining or quantifying the amount of recoverable attorneys' fees and
costs (through both trial and appellate levels) from the nonprevailing party.

  



  

8.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
delivery of which may be by facsimile or other electronic transmission,
including in "portable document format" (.pdf), and each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement other than this _Section
8.12_ shall survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement that by their terms apply or are to be
performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time.

(a) From the date hereof until the earliest to occur of (x) the
Effective Time, (y) the entry without the prior written consent of
such Shareholder into any amendment or modification of the Merger Agreement,

and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof) and (B) the approval of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) against (A) any action or agreement that would be reasonably

that would otherwise be inconsistent with, prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, and (B) other than the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement, any proposal that is in favor of or that would facilitate
an Acquisition Proposal, without regard to the terms of such proposal.

  



  

(b) Each Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any
written consent to rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or
written consent, as a shareholder of HSB, to approve or adopt the Merger
Agreement unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms.

  



  

(c) Each Shareholder represents and warrants and covenants and

entered into, and shall not enter into during the Support Period, any voting
agreement or voting trust with respect to the Owned Shares and (ii) has not
granted, and shall not grant during the Support Period, a proxy, consent or
power of attorney with respect to the Owned Shares except any proxy to carry

Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which ABCB or HSB may be entitled (including monetary damages), each of ABCB and HSB shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof.

contract, direct or indirect, at law or in equity that such party ever had or
now has against any Shareholder Released Party, for or by reason of any
matter, circumstance, event, action, inaction, omission, cause or thing
whatsoever relating to such Person's ownership of Shares or status as a
Shareholder and (ii) expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute which

Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, nothing contained herein
shall operate to release any obligations of any Shareholder arising under
this Agreement.

  



  

14. _Amendments; Waivers_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed (i) in the case of an amendment, by ABCB, HSB and the applicable Shareholder(s), and (ii) in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 _Exhibit C_

  



  

FORM OF

  



  

 _DIRECTOR NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT _

  



  

THIS DIRECTOR NON-SOLICITATION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is entered
into as of the 25th day of January, 2018, by and between Ameris Bancorp, a
Georgia corporation (" _Ameris_ "), which is the holding company of Ameris
Bank, a Georgia state-chartered bank (" _Ameris Bank_ "), and the undersigned
director (" _Director_ ") of Hamilton State Bancshares, Inc., a Georgia
corporation (" _Hamilton_ "), and/or Hamilton State Bank, a Georgia state-
chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of Hamilton (" _Hamilton State
Bank_ "), is conditioned upon consummation of the Merger (as
hereinafter defined) and shall become effective at the Effective Time
provided in the Merger Agreement (as hereinafter defined).

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Ameris and Hamilton
have determined that the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date
hereof, by and between Ameris and Hamilton (as the same may be amended or
supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") and the business combination and
related transactions contemplated thereby are in the best interests of their
respective entities and shareholders;

  



  

WHEREAS, subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Hamilton will merge
with and into Ameris, with Ameris being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_
");

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties hereto acknowledge that Director, as a director of
Hamilton and/or Hamilton State Bank, occupies a unique position of trust and
confidence with respect to Hamilton and Hamilton State Bank;

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties further acknowledge that, by virtue of this position,
Director has acquired significant knowledge relating to the business of
Hamilton and Hamilton State Bank;

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Ameris has determined that it is in the
best interests of Ameris and its shareholders to protect the business and
goodwill associated with the business of Hamilton and Hamilton State Bank by
agreeing to certain restrictions with respect to Director's use and
disclosure of confidential information as well as the solicitation of
customers and employees following the completion of the Merger;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates that, upon the execution and
delivery of the Merger Agreement by Hamilton, as a condition and inducement
to the willingness of Ameris to enter into the Merger Agreement and complete
the Merger, Director will enter into and perform this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Director has agreed to accept such limitations on his ability to
compete with the Ameris and Ameris Bank following the Merger as an inducement
for Ameris to execute the Merger Agreement;

  



    

 | | 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, including, without limitation, the Merger
Consideration to be received by Director, the sufficiency and receipt of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Certain Definitions_. 

  



  

(a) " _Affiliated Company_ " means any company or entity controlled
by, controlling or under common control with Ameris or Hamilton,
including Ameris Bank and Hamilton State Bank.

  



  

(b) " _Confidential Information_ " means all information regarding
Hamilton, Ameris, and their Affiliated Companies and any of their
respective activities, businesses or customers that is not generally known to
persons not employed (whether as employees or independent contractors) by
Hamilton, Ameris or their respective Affiliated Companies, that is not
generally disclosed publicly to persons not employed by Hamilton, Ameris or
their respective Affiliated Companies (except to their regulatory authorities
and pursuant to confidential or other relationships where there is no
expectation of public disclosure or use by third Persons), and that is the
subject of reasonable efforts to keep it confidential, and/or where such
information is subject to limitations on disclosure or use by Applicable Law.
" _Confidential Information_ " shall include, without limitation, all customer
information, customer lists, confidential methods of operation, lending and
credit information, commissions, product/service formulas, information
concerning techniques for use and integration of websites and other
products/services, current and future development and expansion or
contraction plans of Hamilton, Ameris or their respective Affiliated
Companies, sale/acquisition plans and contacts, marketing plans and
contacts, information concerning the legal affairs of Hamilton, Ameris or
their respective Affiliated Companies, and information concerning the pricing
of products and services, strategy, tactics and financial affairs of Hamilton,
Ameris or their respective Affiliated Companies. " _Confidential Information_
" also includes any "confidential information," "trade secrets" or any
equivalent term under any other Applicable Law. " _Confidential Information_ "
shall not include information that (i) has become generally available to the
public other than as a result of Director's breach of this Agreement, (ii) is
obtained by Director from one who has the right to disclose such information
without violating any right or privilege of Hamilton or Ameris or their
respective Affiliated Companies or any duty owed to any of them, (iii) was
rightfully in the possession of a Person prior to receipt of such
Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, from Director or (iv) is
independently developed by a Person without reference to or use of
Confidential Information.

  



  

(c) Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the
respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2. _Nondisclosure of Confidential Information_. 

  



  

(a) Director agrees (i) to maintain the confidentiality of
Confidential Information and (ii) except as required by Law, not to
use, distribute, disclose or otherwise disseminate Confidential Information
or any physical embodiments thereof. In the event that Director is required
by Law to disclose any Confidential Information, Director will: (A) if and to
the extent permitted by Law, provide Ameris with prompt notice of such
requirement prior to the disclosure so that Ameris may waive the requirements
of this Agreement or seek an appropriate protective order at Ameris's sole
expense; and (B) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
assurances that any Confidential Information disclosed will be accorded
confidential treatment. If, in the absence of a waiver or protective order,
Director is nonetheless, in the opinion of his or her counsel, required to
disclose Confidential Information, disclosure may be made only as to that
portion of the Confidential Information that counsel advises Director is
required to be disclosed. Director also acknowledges and agrees that trading
in Ameris securities using material non-public information may violate
federal and state securities Laws and agrees to comply with such securities
Laws.

  



  

The confidentiality obligations under this Agreement shall (x) with regard to
Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under Applicable
Law, remain in effect as long as such information constitutes a trade secret
under Applicable Law, and (y) with regard to all other Confidential
Information, remain in effect for so long as such information constitutes
Confidential Information, or three (3) years, whichever is shorter.

  



  

(b) Director and Ameris agree that Director's obligations under
these nondisclosure covenants are separate and distinct from other
provisions of this Agreement, and a failure or alleged failure of Hamilton
and Ameris to perform their obligations under any provision of this Agreement
or other agreements with Director shall not constitute a defense to, or waiver
of the enforceability of, these nondisclosure covenants. Nothing in this
provision or this Agreement shall limit any rights or remedies otherwise
available to Hamilton, Ameris or any Affiliated Company under Applicable Law.

  



  

3. _Nonrecruitment and Nonsolicitation Covenants_. 

  



  

(a) Director hereby agrees that for one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior written consent
of Ameris, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other Person,
solicit, recruit or hire any employee of Ameris or any of Ameris's Affiliated
Companies who was an employee of Hamilton or Hamilton State Bank during the
two year period ending on the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that
it shall not be a breach of this Section 3(a) if a company on which Director
serves as a member of the board of directors solicits, recruits or hires any
employee of Ameris or any of Ameris's Affiliated Companies without direction
from Director. Nothing in this Section 3(a) is intended to prohibit general
advertising or general solicitation not specifically directed at employees of
Ameris or any of Ameris's Affiliated Companies or the
solicitation, recruitment or hiring of any person that is not an employee of
Ameris at the time of such solicitation, recruitment or hiring.

  



  

(b) Director hereby agrees that for one (1) year following the
Effective Time, Director shall not, without the prior written consent
of Ameris, directly or indirectly, on behalf of himself or any other Person,
solicit or attempt to solicit any customer of Hamilton, Ameris or any of
their Affiliated Companies, in each case, with whom Director had Material
Contact on behalf of Hamilton or Hamilton State Bank in the course of
Director's service as a director of Hamilton or Hamilton State Bank;
_provided_ , _however_ , that it shall not be a breach of this Section 3(b)
if a company on which Director serves as a member of the board of
directors solicits or attempts to solicit any customer of Hamilton, Ameris or
any of their Affiliated Companies without direction from Director. For
purposes of this Section 3(b), "Material Contact" shall mean a meeting or
conversation, in person, in writing (including, but not limited to, email),
or via telephone, with a client of Hamilton or Hamilton State Bank regarding
the client's account or Hamilton's or Hamilton State Bank's products,
services, expertise and/or capabilities.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Director acknowledges that Ameris and each of its Affiliated
Companies has a current and future expectation of business from the
current and proposed customers of Hamilton and Hamilton State Bank as a
result of the acquisition of Hamilton by Ameris. Director acknowledges that
the term and scope of the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable
and agrees that he will not, in any action, suit or other proceeding, deny
the reasonableness of, or assert the unreasonableness of, the premises,
consideration or scope of the covenants set forth herein. Director agrees
that his position as a director of Hamilton and/or Hamilton State Bank
involves information relating to all aspects of the business activities of
Hamilton and/or Hamilton State Bank. Director further acknowledges that
complying with the provisions contained in this Agreement will not preclude
him from engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business, or from becoming
gainfully employed. Director and Ameris agree that if any portion of the
foregoing covenants is deemed to be unenforceable because the time or scope
of activities restricted is deemed to be too broad, then the court shall be
authorized to substitute for the overbroad term an enforceable term that will
enable the enforcement of the covenants to the maximum extent possible under
Applicable Law. Director acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened
breach of this covenant will result in irreparable damage and injury to
Ameris and its Affiliated Companies and that Ameris will be entitled to
exercise all rights, including, without limitation, seeking one or more
temporary restraining orders, injunctive relief and other equitable
relief, including specific performance in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement, in any federal or state court of
competent jurisdiction without the necessity of posting any bond or security
(all of which are waived by Director), and to exercise all other rights or
remedies, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to
damages.

  



  

4. _Successors_. This Agreement is personal to Director and is not assignable by Director, and none of Director's duties hereunder may be delegated. This Agreement may be assigned by, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of, Ameris and any of its Affiliated Companies and their successors and assigns.

  



  

5. _Waiver_. Failure of any party to insist, in one or more instances, on performance by the other in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of any right granted in this Agreement or of the future performance of any such term or condition or of any other term or condition of this Agreement, unless such waiver is contained in a writing signed by the party making the waiver.

  



  

6. _Severability_. If any provision or covenant, or any part thereof, of this Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions or covenants, or any part thereof, of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in full force and effect.

  



  

7. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of laws.
