      made or asserted against either of them relating to Sea-Invest
      International (and any costs or expenses, including legal fees, incurred
      in defending themselves from any of the foregoing). Such indemnity is not
      subject to Clause 6.6.

4.6   One of the Owned Vessels is the VANESSA (the "Vanessa"). Fouquet Sacop
      ("FOUQUET"), the time charterer of the Vanessa, has a call option to
      purchase the Vanessa, which it can exercise in the event that Sea-Invest
      would no longer be a majority shareholder of the Company. FOUQUET is
      entitled to exercise this call option in respect of the Vanessa within 60
      days after being informed in writing of such change in the share capital
      of the Company. The Parties will procure that within one week of the
      Completion the Company informs FOUQUET in writing that such a change in
      the shareholders of the Company has occurred. If FOUQUET exercises its
      call option within the time frame of the said 60 days and purchases the
      Vanessa on the terms agreed between the Company, Sea-Invest and FOUQUET,
      the Buyer shall notify the Sellers in writing thereof. In that case, on
      the date of purchase by FOUQUET of the Vanessa, the Sellers shall pay to
      Buyer an amount equal to 33.99 % of the difference between (i) the price
      paid by FOUQUET to the Company on the occasion of the sale of the Vanessa
      by the Company to FOUQUET and (ii) the book value of the Vanessa as stated
      in the audited financial statements of the Company for the period ended
      December 31, 2006 (cfr. Appendix three) minus the pro rata depreciation
      for the period from January 1, 2007 up to the date of the purchase of the
      Vanessa by FOUQUET at the depreciation percentage of 7% per annum, it
      being understood that the Company has no obligation to reinvest in a new
      vessel. The Buyer shall procure that the Company shall not hinder or delay
      any such sale of the Vanessa to FOUQUET. Each Seller shall be severally
      liable for a proportion of such payment equal to their proportion of the
      Shares that they are selling. If one or more Seller does not pay its
      proportionate part when due, then such Seller shall also pay (i) all costs
      and expenses incurred by the Buyer and its affiliates, including legal
      fees, in collecting such amount plus (ii) interest at the rate identified
      in Clause 15 from the due date until the date actually collected on such
      amount and from the date incurred until the date actually collected on all
      such costs and expenses incurred in collecting such amount. No such
      payment shall be applied against the indemnity cap referred to in Clause
      6.6(c).

      Disclosed Legal Proceedings shall be a Claim made pursuant to Clause 6.8.

      A Claim is CONNECTED with another Claim or Substantiated Claim if they all
      arise out of the occurrence of the same event or relate to the same
      subject matter.

6.2   The provisions of this Agreement set out the limitations on Claims that
      may be made against the Sellers and these limitations replace and exclude
      any and all other recourse to which the Buyer may be entitled, in law or
      otherwise, against the Sellers, their personnel, their advisers and their
      consultants, except for fraud or intentional misconduct ("bedrog / dol").

6.3   The Sellers' liability is subject to the following restrictions and
      limitations:

      (a)   in relation to Claims and any Claims for Losses in respect of
            Disclosed Legal Proceedings, the liability of the Sellers is not
            joint and several so that they shall each only be liable for a
            proportion of the total liability in respect of Claims,
            Substantiated Claims and any Claim for Losses in respect of
            Disclosed Legal Proceedings and all other matters arising under and
            in relation to this Agreement equal to the proportion of the total
            number of Shares owned by each of them;

      (b)   the Sellers give no Warranties as to the future profitability of the
            Company. Without prejudice to Warranties given by the Sellers in
            respect of historic performance of obligations by Third Parties owed
            to the Company or to Bulkinvest under contracts that such Third
            Parties have signed with the Company or with Bulkinvest, the Sellers
            give no Warranties and none of the Sellers shall have any liability
            at all (as the Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees) in respect of
            and/or resulting from:

            (i)   future performance or default by Third Parties of their
                  obligations under contracts that they have signed with the
                  Company or with Bulkinvest, and losses or failure to receive
                  anticipated income resulting from failure by Third Parties to
                  perform, in full or in part, their obligations under contracts
                  that they have signed with the Company or with Bulkinvest,
                  provided that the Sellers represent and warrant that they have
                  no actual knowledge of any fact or circumstance that could
                  reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
                  the near term future operations of the Company, and, provided
                  further that there shall be excluded from this representation
                  and warranty any industry-wide matter which affects the
                  Business as a result of factors which also generally affect
                  other companies which carry out similar businesses, such as
                  changes in shipping rates; or

            (ii)  actual results of performance by the Company or Bulkinvest of
                  their obligations under contracts that they have signed, even
                  if those are different from those estimated by the Company, it
                  being understood and agreed that such estimates and the
                  assumptions on which they have been based are all only
                  estimates made in good faith by the Company in the normal
                  conduct of the Business for its own internal management
                  purposes and not as financial projections on which the Buyer
                  may rely,

      (c)   Except as set forth in Clause 6.8, the Sellers shall not be liable
            in respect of any Claim to the extent that such Claim:

            (i)   relates to any matter specifically and fully disclosed in the
                  Accounts, or

            (ii)  has otherwise been fully disclosed in the annexes to this
                  Agreement.

6.5   Except as set forth in Clause 6.8 and except for any Claim pursuant to
      Clause 7.2(c), the Sellers are not liable for a Claim unless the Buyer has
      given the Sellers notice in writing of the Claim, summarising the nature
      of the Claim as far as it is known to the Buyer and the amount claimed,
      within the period of twenty four (24) months after the Completion Date.

6.6   The Sellers shall not be liable for a Claim:

      (a)   unless the amount of a Substantiated Claim, or of a series of
            connected Substantiated Claims of which that Substantiated Claim is
            one, exceeds $25,000;

      (b)   unless the amount of all Substantiated Claims that are not otherwise
            excluded, when taken together, exceeds $50,000, in which case the
            whole amount (and not just the amount by which the limit in this
            clause 6.6(b) is exceeded) is recoverable by the Buyer; and

      (c)   if and to the extent that the aggregate liability of the Sellers for
            Substantiated Claims shall exceed $20,000,000.

6.7   In relation to the conduct of Claims and any Claim for Losses in respect
      of Disclosed Legal Proceedings, to the extent that these involve bringing
      or continuing proceedings against third parties or defending claims from
      third parties, the Sellers may arrange for all such actions to be taken in
      the name of the Company and/or Bulkinvest and, if the Sellers determine to
      do this, then the Buyer shall procure that everything is done by the
      Company and/or Bulkinvest so as to enable this to be done. If the Sellers
      do not exercise such right then the Buyer shall procure that such action
      is taken and, in such case, the Sellers shall have the right to be kept
      informed of the conduct of such proceedings but the manner in which those
      proceedings are to be conducted shall be determined by the Buyer.

6.8   (a)   Without Prejudice to Clauses 6.6 (a) and (c) the Sellers shall not
            be liable for a Claim for Losses in respect of Disclosed Legal
            Proceedings unless the Losses from all Disclosed Legal Proceedings,
            calculated in the manner as indicated hereunder, exceed $1,000,000,
            in which case only such excess (and not the whole amount) is
            recoverable by Buyer.

      (b)   If, by the date which is twenty-four (24) months after the
            Completion Date, there are Losses on account of Disclosed Legal
            Proceedings for which Buyer is entitled to be indemnified then the
            Buyer shall send Sellers a written notice within 30 days after such
            24th month, indicating that it has a Claim (a "CLAIM FOR LOSSES IN
            RESPECT OF DISCLOSED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS") and providing a reasonably
            detailed calculation for the Claim including supporting documents as
            follows:


                                       11

<PAGE>

            (i)   the amounts paid in settlement or as a result of a judgment or
                  award in respect of Disclosed Legal Proceedings, excluding
                  interest and insured costs and expenses incurred in defending
                  or prosecuting Disclosed Legal Proceedings;

            (ii)  plus the amount of uninsured costs and expenses incurred in
                  defending or prosecuting Disclosed Legal Proceedings,

            (iii) less the amount paid to the Company in respect of Disclosed
                  Legal Proceedings, excluding interest.

            Such Claim for Losses in respect of Disclosed Legal Proceedings
            shall also indicate the amount payable by Sellers after application
            of the limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (c) of Clause 6.6
            and in Clause 6.8 (a).

      (c)   Within 15 days of receipt of such Claim for Losses in respect of
            Disclosed Legal Proceedings, each of the Sellers shall pay to Buyer
            its proportionate share (based on their participation in the
            Purchase Price) of the amount asserted to be due in respect of such
            Claim for Losses in respect of Disclosed Legal Proceedings.

      (d)   In respect to Disclosed Legal Proceedings which are still pending
            twenty-four (24) months after the Completion Date, a Seller may
            elect by written notice to Buyer to continue to bear responsibility
            for Losses from such pending claim until such time as it is
            ultimately resolved or to enter into negotiations with Buyer as to a
            mutually acceptable cash settlement and, if no such mutually
            acceptable settlement is reached, that Seller shall continue to bear
            its share of responsibility for Losses with respect to the pending
            matter in which case both Clauses 6.8(a) and 6.8(b) shall continue
            to apply in respect of the calculation of the amount due.

      (e)   If any Seller fails to pay its share of a Claim for Disclosed Legal
            Proceedings when due, then such Seller shall also pay (i) all costs
            and expenses incurred by the Buyer, and its affiliates, including
            legal fees, in collecting such amount plus (ii) interest at the rate
            specified in Clause 15 from the due date until the date actually
            collected on such amount and from the date incurred until the date
            actually collected on all such costs and expenses of collecting such
            amount. Such costs and expenses of collection and interest shall not
            be subject to the limitations referred to in Clause 6.6 or this
            Clause 6.8.

      (f)   Without prejudice to Clause 6.7 it is mutually understood that the
            conduct of the Disclosed Legal Proceedings is solely at the
            discretion of the management of the Company at that time and will be
            consistent with past practices of the Company and general good
            practice in the business.

7.    INDEMNITIES

7.1   The Sellers' indemnification obligations pursuant to this Clause 7 shall
      be several and not joint, and each Seller shall be liable only for a
      proportion of any liability arising under this Clause equal to the
      proportion of the total number of Shares sold by such Seller.

7.2   Subject to the terms and conditions of this Clause 7 (including without
      limitation the limitations set forth in Clause 6), the Sellers hereby
      agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer and its officers,
      directors, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "BUYER
      INDEMNITEES") from and against all Losses asserted against, resulting to,
      imposed upon, or incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee by reason of, arising
      out of or resulting from:

            (a) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or Warranty of
            Sellers contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, any
            Appendix, Schedule or any certificate delivered by the Sellers to
            Buyer pursuant to this Agreement with respect hereto or thereto in
            connection with the Completion;

            (b) the non-fulfillment or breach of any agreement of the Sellers or
            the Company contained in this Agreement;

            (c) (i) any Taxes with respect to any Tax year or portion thereof
            ending on or before the Completion Date (or for any Tax year
            beginning before and ending after the Completion Date to the extent
            allocable to the portion of such period beginning before and ending
            on the Completion Date) imposed upon the Company or Sellers
            (including any Taxes arising out of this transaction) and (ii)
            without duplication of items covered in clause (i), any breach of
            the representations and warranties in Clause 20 on Appendix 4.
            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
            Agreement, this indemnity obligation as to any Tax shall survive
            until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of
            limitation for that Tax.; or

            (d) Disclosed Legal Proceedings, but only to the extent set out in
            Clause 6.8.

7.3   The Buyer shall notify the Sellers of any Claim for which the Sellers may
      have an indemnification liability under Clause 5.3 of this Agreement as
      soon as reasonably possible, giving reasonable details. In the event that
      (a) the Sellers have not objected to the amount claimed by the Buyer for
      indemnification with respect to any Loss in accordance with the procedures
      set forth in the Bank Guarantees, such objection to be made in writing
      within 15 days after the Sellers have received the Buyer's notice, or (b)
      the Sellers have delivered notice of their disagreement as to the amount
      of any indemnification requested by the Buyer such disagreement to be made
      in writing by the Sellers to the Buyer within 15 days after the Sellers
      have received the Buyer's notice, and either (i) the Sellers and the Buyer
      shall have, subsequent to the Sellers having given such notice, mutually
      agreed a specified amount in respect of the Sellers' liability and


                                       13

<PAGE>

      shall have so jointly notified each of the guaranteeing banks or (ii) a
      final nonappealable judgment shall have been rendered by the court having
      jurisdiction over the matters relating to such claim by the Buyer for
      indemnification from the Sellers and the guaranteeing banks shall have
      received, in the case of clause (i) above, joint written instructions from
      the Seller and the Buyer or, in the case of clause (ii) above, a copy of
      the final nonappealable judgment of the court, the guaraneeing banks shall
      deliver to the Buyer from the Bank Guarantees any amount determined to be
      owed to the Buyer under this Clause 7.3 in accordance with the Bank
      Guarantees. The Buyer shall make demand under all of the Bank Guarantees
      at the same time. Each such demand shall be for the "Relevant Percentage",
      as defined in the Bank Guarantees, of the total amount of the relevant
      Claim.

7.4   As used in this Clause 7, the term "Losses" shall include all direct
      losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders, penalties,
      settlements, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest,
      penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and expenses, but
      excluding any consequential losses, loss of profit or loss of reputation)
      including those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions, costs of
      investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of action,
      proceedings and assessments whether or not made by Third Parties or
      whether or not ultimately determined to be valid. Solely for the purpose
      of determining the amount of any Losses (and not for determining any
      breach) for which any Buyer Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification
      pursuant to Clause 7, any Losses recoverable in respect of a breach of
      representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified
      by a term or terms such as "material" or "materially," or any equivalent
      qualification shall include all Losses that are recoverable in respect of
      such breach, and not only the "material" Losses or the Losses that relate
      to the part which is "material."

7.5   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
      parties' rights and remedies under Clause 6, Clause 7 and Clause 17 shall
      not exclude or limit any other rights or remedies that may be available to
      them under Belgian law, such as (without limitation) the right to apply to
      a court of competent authority in any jurisdiction for relief by way of
      injunction or restraining order or the right to seek specific performance
      of this Agreement, it being however understood and agreed that, except in
      case of fraud or intentional misconduct ("bedrog / dol"), the parties
      hereby to the fullest extent permitted by law waive: (i) the right to seek
      the termination of this Agreement (at any time, including after the
      Completion Date), be it pursuant to the theory of "wilsgebreken / vices de
      consentement", article 1641 et seq. of the Belgian Civil Code, Article
      1184 of the Belgian Civil Code or otherwise; and (ii) the right to seek
      damages otherwise than pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement,
      be it pursuant to pre-contractual or extra-contractual liability, article
      1641 et seq. of the Belgian Civil Code, Article 1184 of the Belgian Civil
      Code or otherwise.

      act done or omitted by the Representative in connection with the
      acceptance or administration of the Representative's duties under this
      Agreement unless such act or omission is found by a court of competent
      jurisdiction not subject to further appeal to involve gross negligence or
      wilful misconduct on the part of the Representative. Further, the Sellers
      shall severally indemnify the Representative and hold him or her harmless
      against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Representative
      arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of

      written notice to each Seller and Buyer. Upon the resignation of the
      Representative, the Sellers holding at least a majority of the Shares held
      by all of the Sellers on the date hereof (determined on a fully-diluted
      basis), shall appoint a replacement Representative to serve in accordance
      with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that such appointment
      shall be subject to such newly-appointed Representative's notifying Buyer
      in writing of his, her or its appointment and appropriate contact
      information for purposes of this Agreement, and Buyer shall be entitled to
      rely upon, without independent investigation, the identity of such
