of Third Avenue Value Fund, ("TAVF") the Whitman High Conviction Fund ("WHCF",
each individually a "Seller" and collectively, the "Sellers") and Cavco
Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Purchaser"). The parties to this
Agreement are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "Party" and
collectively as the "Parties".

WHEREAS, TAVF owns 982.65 shares of common stock of Fleetwood Homes, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Fleetwood"), representing 48.44% of the total issued
and outstanding shares of common stock of Fleetwood;



WHEREAS, WHCF owns 31.63 shares of common stock of Fleetwood, representing
1.56% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Fleetwood
(together with the shares owned by TAVF, the "Shares");



WHEREAS, Purchaser owns 1,014.28 shares of common stock of Fleetwood,
representing 50% of the total issued outstanding shares of common stock of
Fleetwood;



WHEREAS Sellers and Purchaser are parties to that Shareholder's Agreement
dated as of August 17, 2009 and any amendments thereto (the "Shareholders'
Agreement");



WHEREAS, Sellers intend to sell to Purchaser and Purchaser intends to purchase
from Sellers the Shares; and



WHEREAS, capitalized terms used herein without definition have the respective
meanings assigned to them in Article XII.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the terms and provisions set
forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the performance thereof and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as follows:



ARTICLE I - PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES



SECTION 1.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Sellers shall sell, transfer, assign and
deliver to Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall acquire and accept from Sellers,
the Shares, constituting the Sellers' entire interest in Fleetwood stock.











SECTION 1.2 Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Shares shall be the
aggregate sum of Ninety-One Million Four Hundred Three Thousand Six Hundred
Ninety-Six Dollars ($91,403,696) (subject to adjustment below, the "Purchase
Price") which Purchase Price shall be paid to Sellers in accordance with
Schedule 1.02 (the "Closing Payment Schedule") in such aggregate number of
shares (the "Issued Shares") of newly issued common stock of the Purchaser,
issuable to Sellers in accordance with the Closing Payment Schedule in a
number equal to the Purchase Price divided by the average of the volume
weighted average prices on the Principal Market (as defined below) as reported
by Bloomberg, L.P. on each of the sixty (60) consecutive trading days ending
on the last trading day immediately prior to the Closing Date (the "Final VWAP
Calculation"); provided, however, that in no event shall the average of the
volume weighted average trading prices of the Common Stock of the Purchaser
used to determine the amount of Issued Shares (the "VWAP Price") be less than
$45.00 per share or greater than $55.00 per share. For the avoidance of doubt,
where the Final VWAP Calculation is less than $45.00 per share, the Final VWAP
Calculation shall be $45.00, and where the Final VWAP Calculation is greater
than $55.00 per share, the Final VWAP Calculation shall be $55.00. The Issued
Shares shall be delivered to Sellers through certificates, or in book form, at
Sellers' election within ten (10) days of the Closing Date.



SECTION 1.3 Registration of the Issued Shares.



(a) The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to prepare and file with the SEC
a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (unless the Purchaser is not then
eligible to register for resale the Issued Shares on Form S-3, in which case
such registration shall be on another appropriate form in accordance with the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act) relating to the resale of the Issued
Shares by the Sellers on a continuous basis no later than 60 days after the
filing of the Purchaser's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
March 29, 2014 (the "Filing Deadline").



(b) Each Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser such information set forth on
the Registration Statement Questionnaire attached hereto as Exhibit A that
relates to the Registration Statement, or as otherwise reasonably required by
the Purchaser or the managing underwriters, if any, to effect the registration
of such Seller\'s Issued Shares, and if not so furnished to the Purchaser, the
Purchaser shall have the right to rely on the most recent information
available to the Purchaser regarding the Seller and the Issued Shares.



(c) The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement filed pursuant to Section 1.3(a) to become effective as soon as
reasonably practicable after such filing, but in no event later than 60 days
thereafter, and promptly after such Registration has been declared effective,
file a final prospectus to be used for sales of the Issued Shares in
connection with such Registration Statement in accordance with Rule 424 under
the Securities Act (the "Prospectus").









(d) The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to keep each Registration
Statement effective pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act at all times
until the date on which the Sellers shall have sold all of the Issued Shares
(the "Registration Period"), including, without limitation, by filing any
necessary amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement. The
Purchaser shall ensure that any Registration Statement filed pursuant to this
Agreement (including any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses
contained therein) shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein, or necessary
to make the statements therein (in the case of prospectuses, in the light of
the circumstances in which they were made) not misleading.



(e) The Purchaser shall permit the Sellers and/or their legal counsel to
review and comment upon any Registration Statement, Prospectus or amendment or
supplement thereto at least five (5) Business Days prior to its filing with
the SEC and not file any Registration Statement or amendment or supplement
thereto in a form to which the Sellers reasonably objects.



(f) The Purchaser shall notify the Sellers in writing of the happening of any
event, as promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, as a
result of which the Registration Statement or the Prospectus includes an
untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and
promptly prepare a supplement or amendment to such Registration Statement or
Prospectus to correct such untrue statement or omission. In addition, if any
stop order or suspension of the Registration Statement or Prospectus is
issued, the Purchaser shall immediately notify the Sellers and take all
reasonable action to obtain the withdrawal of such order or suspension at the
earliest practicable moment.



(g) The Purchaser shall use its best efforts to cause the Issued Shares
covered by the Registration Statement to be listed on each securities exchange
on which securities of the same class or series issued by the Purchaser are
then listed.



(h) The Purchaser shall not identify any Seller as an underwriter without its
prior written consent in any public disclosure or filing with the SEC or the
Principal Market.



(i) The Purchaser shall enter into such customary agreements for underwritten
secondary offerings and take all such other reasonable actions and deliver or
cause to be delivered such other document and instruments requested by the
Sellers or the lead underwriter in any secondary underwritten offering in
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Cavco Shares.

ARTICLE IX - TERMINATION



SECTION 9.1 Termination. At any time prior to Closing, this Agreement may be
terminated:



(a) by mutual written consent of the parties hereto;

restraining or prohibiting the transaction contemplated by this Agreement and

and nonappealable;



(c) by any of the parties in the event Purchaser does not obtain stockholder
approval of the Proposal, in accordance with Section 1.2(b); and



(d) by any of the parties if any of the conditions in Article V has not been
satisfied or waived as of August 31, 2013 or if satisfaction of such a
condition is or becomes impossible; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) shall not be available to
any party whose material breach of a representation, warranty or covenant in
this Agreement has been a principal cause of the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in Article V to be satisfied by such date or of the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in Article V to be capable of being
satisfied.



SECTION 9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9.1(a) or Section 9.1(b), this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and of no further force or effect, and there shall
be no liability hereunder on the part of any party or its Affiliates,
directors, officers, shareholders, agents or other representatives; provided,

13.8 shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing

ARTICLE XI - RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER



SECTION 11.1 Right of First Offer.



(a) At any time and from time to time during the Standstill Period, and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in this Section 11.1, the
Purchaser shall have a right of first offer if any Seller (the "Offering
Seller") proposes to Transfer all or any portion of any shares of common stock
of the Purchaser that the Seller owns (the "Offered Stock") to any independent
third party. Each time the Offering Seller proposes to Transfer any Offered
Stock (other than Transfers set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of Permitted
Transfers), the Offering Seller shall first make an offering of the Offered
Stock to the Purchaser in accordance with the following provisions of this
Section 11.1.



(b) The Offering Seller shall give written notice (the "ROFO Notice", which
may be in the form of an email) to the Purchaser stating its bona fide
intention to Transfer the Offered Stock and specifying the number of Offered
Stock and the material terms and conditions, including the price, pursuant to
which the Offering Seller proposes to Transfer the Offered Stock. The ROFO
Notice shall constitute a Seller's offer to Transfer all of the Offered Stock
to the Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this Section



11.1, which offer shall be irrevocable until the end of the ROFO Purchaser
Option Period (defined below), and the consummation of any sale of the Offered
Stock to the Purchaser.

(c) The ROFO Notice shall constitute a Seller's offer to Transfer all of the
Offered Stock to the Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 11.1, which offer shall be irrevocable until the end of the Purchaser
Option Period, and the consummation of any sale of the Offered Stock to the
Purchaser.



(d) By delivering the ROFO Notice, a Seller represents and warrants to the
Purchaser that:



(i) Seller has full right, title and interest in and to the Offered Stock
described in the ROFO Notice;



(ii) Seller has all the necessary power and authority and has taken all
necessary action to Transfer the Offered Stock described in the ROFO Notice as
contemplated by this Section 11.1; and



(iii) the Offered Stock described in the ROFO Notice is free and clear of any
and all Liens.



SECTION 11.2 Exercise of Right of First Offer.



(a) Upon receipt of the ROFO Notice, the Purchaser shall have the right to
purchase any or all of the Offered Stock on the terms and at the purchase
price set forth in the ROFO Notice and in accordance with the procedures set
forth herein.



(b) The initial right of the Purchaser to purchase any Offered Stock shall be
exercisable with the delivery of a written notice (the "Purchaser ROFO
Exercise Notice", which may be in the form of an email) by the Purchaser to
the applicable Seller within one (1) day of the Purchaser's receipt of the
ROFO Notice if the amount of the Offered Stock is less than 100,000 shares of
common stock of the Purchaser or within five (5) days of the Purchaser's
receipt of the ROFO Notice if the amount of the Offered Stock is greater than
100,000 shares of common stock of the Purchaser (the "Purchaser Option
Period"), stating the applicable number (including where such number is zero)
of shares of Offered Stock the Purchaser elects to purchase on the terms and
at the purchase price set forth in the ROFO Notice. The Purchaser ROFO
Exercise Notice shall be binding upon delivery and irrevocable by the
Purchaser. If the Purchaser fails to deliver the Purchaser ROFO Exercise
Notice during the Purchaser Option Period, the Purchaser shall be deemed to
have elected not to purchase any of the Offered Stock.



(c) The failure of the Purchaser to deliver a Purchaser ROFO Exercise Notice
by the end of the Purchaser Option Period shall constitute a waiver of its
rights of first refusal under this Article XI with respect to the Transfer of
the Offered Stock, but shall not affect its rights with respect to any future
Transfers.











(d) In the event that the Purchaser shall have exercised its rights to
purchase the Offered Stock, then the applicable Seller shall sell such Offered
Stock to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase such Offered Stock,
within thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Purchaser Option
Period. Seller shall take all actions as may be reasonably necessary to
consummate the sale contemplated by this Article XI including, without
limitation, entering into agreements and delivering certificates and
instruments and consents as may be deemed necessary or appropriate. At the
closing of any sale and purchase pursuant to this Section 11.2(d), Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser certificates (if any) representing the Offered
Stock to be sold, free and clear of any Liens or encumbrances, accompanied by
evidence of transfer and all necessary transfer taxes paid and stamps affixed,
if necessary, against receipt of the purchase price therefor and the amount of
any transfer taxes, if any, from the Purchaser by certified or official bank
check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds.



(e) In the event that the Purchaser shall not have elected to purchase all of
the Offered Stock, then, provided the Seller has also complied with the
provisions of Article XI, the Seller may Transfer such shares of such Offered
Stock that the Purchaser has elected not to buy, at a price per Share for the
Offered Stock not less than that specified in the ROFO Notice and on other
terms and conditions which are not materially more favorable in the aggregate
to the Prospective Transferee than those specified in the ROFO Notice, but
only to the extent that such Transfer occurs within thirty (30) days after
expiration of the Purchaser Option Period. Any Offered Stock not Transferred
within such thirty (30) day period will be subject to the provisions of this
Article XI upon subsequent Transfer.

SCHEDULE 1.2























































SCHEDULE 4.5

As disclosed in the Purchaser's periodic reports filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, on July 8, 2011, the Purchaser filed an
amendment to its current report on Form 8-K/A, which filing included the
consolidated balance sheets of Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., a Florida corporation
and its subsidiaries ("Palm Harbor") as of March 26, 2010 and March 27, 2009
and the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 26, 2010, and the
notes related thereto. These financial statements were previously audited and
included in Palm Harbor's Form 10-K for the year ended March 26, 2010.
However, Palm Harbor's auditor was not able to perform its customary
procedures to its satisfaction to enable it to consent to the inclusion of its
prior audit report in the referenced Form 8-K/A filing due to the untimely and
limited cooperation of Palm Harbor and the bankruptcy estate of Palm Harbor
towards the completion of those procedures. Accordingly, (i) the Palm Harbor
financial statements are considered unaudited, preliminary and subject to
change (ii) the Form 8-K/A filing is incomplete and untimely, and (iii) the
Palm Harbor financial statements are not presented in accordance with
Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission.



As a result, the Company does not satisfy the requirements to provide
financial statements in accordance with Regulation S-X, including, but not
limited to Rule 3-05, in any filing, registration statement or proxy statement
requiring such financial statements, due to the absence of the consent of Palm
Harbor's independent registered public accounting firm with respect to Palm
Harbor's financial statements.



























SCHEDULE 4.6

As disclosed in the Purchaser's periodic reports filed with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, on July 8, 2011, the Purchaser filed an

and its subsidiaries ("Palm Harbor") as of March 26, 2010 and March 27, 2009

However, Palm Harbor's auditor was not able to perform its customary

and Exchange Commission.



As a result, the Company does not satisfy the requirements to provide
financial statements in accordance with Regulation S-X, including, but not
