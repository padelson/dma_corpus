the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL,
at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving

value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each a " _Company Share_ ," and

prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal Shares, Company Shares
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Parent and Company Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case, not held

(the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (ii) 0.6494 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of
a share (the " _Stock Consideration_ ," together with the Cash Consideration,
the " _Merger Consideration_ ") of common stock, par value $5.00 per share, of

At the Effective Time, all of the Company Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly
representing any of the Company Shares, and each non-certificated Company
Share represented by book entry (each, a " _Book Entry Company Share_ "),
other than in each case those representing Excluded Shares, shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive, without interest, (A) the Merger
Consideration, (B) with respect to the Stock Consideration, the right, if any,
to receive (1) pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares into which such Company Shares have been converted
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ and (2) any distribution or dividend

share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



3 4.2 _Exchange of Company Shares_.

 

(a) Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange
agent selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, (i) at
the Effective Time, certificates (or at Parents option, evidence of non-
certificated Parent Shares in book-entry form (" _Book Entry Parent Shares_
")), constituting at least the amounts necessary for the Stock Consideration,
(ii) at the Effective Time, cash in immediately available funds constituting
at least the amounts necessary for the Cash Consideration, plus any cash paid
in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_, and (iii) as necessary from time to time after the Effective Time, if
applicable, any cash and dividends or other distributions with respect to the
Parent Shares to be issued or to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_
or with respect to the Company Shares to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)(C)_, in exchange for Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, deliverable upon due surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) or Book Entry Company Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article IV_ (such cash, certificates for Parent Shares
and evidence of Book Entry Parent Shares, together with the amount of any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to this _Article IV_ with
respect thereto, in the aggregate, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange
Agent shall invest the cash available in the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in obligations, funds or
accounts typical for (including having liquidity typical for) transactions of
this nature. To the extent that there are losses with respect to
such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the
level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate cash portion of
the Cash Consideration plus cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ as contemplated hereby, Parent shall
promptly replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such
investments or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a part
of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent. The Exchange
Agent shall also act as the agent for the Companys stockholders for the
purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and Book Entry Company
Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares represented
thereby.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of Company Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) that are evidenced by Certificates or Book Entry Company
Shares not held through the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") (i) a letter
of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book
Entry Company Shares shall pass only upon delivery of the Certificates (or
affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) or transfer of the Book
Entry Company Shares to the Exchange Agent (including customary provisions
with respect to delivery of an "agents message" with respect to Book Entry
Company Shares) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in
lieu of the Certificates) or transferring the Book Entry Company Shares to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash paid
in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_ and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to which the holder
has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(C)_ or _Section_
__ _ 4.2(d)_. With respect to

 



4  Book Entry Company Shares held through DTC, Parent and the Company shall
cooperate to establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and DTC to ensure
that the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees as soon as
reasonably practicable on or after the Closing Date, upon surrender of Company
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) held of record by DTC or its nominees in
accordance with DTCs customary surrender procedures, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ and any dividends or distributions, in each case, to
which the beneficial owners thereof are entitled pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

(c) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) After the Effective Time, and (A) upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) that are Certificates, by
physical surrender of such Certificates (or affidavit of lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate in lieu of a Certificate, as provided in _Section_ __ _
4.2(h)_) in accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal and
accompanying instructions, (B) upon the transfer of Company Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) that are Book Entry Company Shares not held through DTC, in
accordance with the terms of the letter of transmittal and
accompanying instructions (including the delivery of any other documents the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require), or (C) upon the transfer of Company
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) that are Book Entry Company Shares held
through DTC, including by delivery of an "agents message," in accordance
with DTCs customary procedures and such other procedures as agreed by Parent,
the Exchange Agent and DTC, the holder of such Company Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
thereof as promptly as practicable, (1) the aggregate amount of Cash
Consideration such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)_, (2) the number of Certificates of Parent Shares or Book Entry Parent
Shares representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that such
holder has a right to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, (3) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.1(a)(C)_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_, and (4) any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_, if applicable.

(ii) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that are not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Exchange Agent may make
payment of the proper amount of Merger Consideration to such transferee if (A)
in the case of Book Entry Company Shares, written instructions authorizing
the transfer of the Book Entry Company Shares are presented to the Exchange
Agent, (B) in the case of Certificates, the Certificates formerly representing
such Company Shares are surrendered to the Exchange Agent, and (C) the
written instructions, in the case of _clause_ __ _ (A)_, and Certificates, in
the case of _clause_ __ _ (B)_, are accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable, in each case, in form and
substance, reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent. If any
Parent Shares are to be delivered to a Person other than the holder in whose
name any Company Shares are registered, it shall be a condition of such
exchange that the Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason of the transfer of Parent Shares to
a Person other than the registered holder of any Company Shares, or shall
establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable.

 



5 (iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender
of the Company Shares. Any Certificate that has been surrendered shall be
cancelled by the Exchange Agent.

(d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Company Shares_. All Parent
Shares to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and, whenever a dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Shares, the record
date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall
include dividends or other distributions in respect of all Stock Consideration
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in
respect of the Parent Shares shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or untransferred Book Entry Company Share until such Certificate
(or affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the
Certificate as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) or Book Entry Company
Share is transferred for exchange in accordance with this _Article IV_.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate (or affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) or transfer of such
Book Entry Company Share that has been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Shares (or as applicable, Book Entry
Parent Shares) issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender or transfer, the dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such
whole Parent Shares and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment date
subsequent to surrender or transfer, as applicable.

 

(e) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Company Shares
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, any Certificate or Book Entry Company Share is presented to
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Exchange Agent for transfer, it shall
be cancelled and exchanged for the aggregate Merger Consideration (and to the
extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ and/or any dividends or other distributions
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(C)_ or _Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_) to which
the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article IV_.

 

(f) _Fractional Company Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional Parent Shares will be issued and any holder of
Company Shares entitled to receive a fractional Parent Share but for this
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ shall be entitled to receive a cash payment in lieu
thereof, without interest, rounded down to the nearest whole cent,
which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall be an
amount equal to the product of (i) the average of the closing prices per
Parent Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") (as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ ), for the ten full trading days ending on the
second Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Effective Time
occurs _multiplied by_ (ii) the fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into
account all Company Shares held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to the nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to
dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional
Parent Shares.

 



6 (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund and any
Parent Shares) that remains unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any holder of
Company Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has theretofore not complied
with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of
any Merger Consideration (and to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ and/or
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(C)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 4.2(d)_), payable and/or issuable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
4.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ upon due surrender of their Certificates (or
affidavits of lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates in lieu of the
Certificates as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 4.2(h)_) or transfer of Book
Entry Company Shares, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Shares
immediately prior to the time at which the Exchange Fund would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity, shall, to the
extent permitted by Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Exchange
Agent or any of Parents Subsidiaries with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration, and (to the extent
applicable) any cash pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ or unpaid dividends
or other distributions pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(C)_ or _Section_
__ _ 4.2(d)_, that would have been payable or deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered.

 

4.3 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand
and properly demands appraisal of such Company Shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Appraisal Shares_
") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_, but rather the holders of Appraisal
Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of the "fair
value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with and to the extent provided
in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to Appraisal Shares, then
the right of such holder to seek appraisal of such Company Shares shall cease
and such Company Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)_,
without interest (and to the extent applicable, cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Shares payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_ and/or any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 4.1(a)(C)_ or _Section_ __
_ 4.2(d)_). The Company shall give prompt notice, and in any event within
two Business Days of receipt, to Parent

 



7  of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares
and any withdrawals of such demands, and Parent shall participate in and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

4.4 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and
outstanding Company Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Company Shares or the issued and outstanding Parent Shares or
securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Parent Shares,
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer
tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, then the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to
proportionally reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and after
the date of such event, be the Merger Consideration; _provided_ that nothing
in this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ shall be construed to permit the Company or
Parent to take any of the foregoing actions with respect to its securities to
the extent otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

4.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Company
Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding and unvested as of
the Effective Time (after application of any vesting acceleration provisions
set forth in the terms of such Company Option) (each such Company Option, an "
_Unvested Company Option_ "), shall, automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a cash-settled
stock appreciation right relating to the number of Parent Shares (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the number of Company Shares
subject to the Unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at a base price per share
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per
Company Share of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
divided by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each Unvested Company
Option shall continue to be governed by substantially the same terms and
conditions (including the terms set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter) as were applicable to such Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the base price and
number of Parent Shares subject to this provision shall be determined in a
manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and, in
the case of Company Options that are intended to qualify as incentive stock
options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code; and _further provided_ that, for
clarification, such stock appreciation right shall be settled solely in cash.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time (taking into account the
application of any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the terms of
such Company Option) shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive an amount, solely in cash (without interest and less
applicable withholdings in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.6_), equal to
the number of Company Shares subject to such Company Option as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the excess, if any, of the Equity 

 



8  Award Cash-Out Consideration over the exercise price per share of such
Company Option. Such cash payment shall be paid as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than the end of
the first regular payroll period commencing immediately following the
Effective Time).

 

(b) _Company RSUs_. At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit
entitling the holder thereof to Company Shares or cash equal to the value of
Company Shares with only time-based vesting requirements (each, a " _Company
RSU_ ") that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time (after
application of any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the terms
of such Company RSU) (each such Company RSU, an " _Unvested Company RSU_ ")
shall, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into a restricted stock unit denominated in Parent Shares
entitling the holder thereof to solely cash equal to the value of the number
of Parent Shares (rounded up to the nearest whole number) equal to (i) the
number of Company Shares subject to such Unvested Company RSU immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each such restricted stock unit shall continue to be governed by substantially
the same terms and conditions (including the terms set forth on _Section_ __
_ 4.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) as were applicable to such Unvested
Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time,
each Company RSU that is outstanding and vested as of the Effective Time
(taking into account the application of any vesting acceleration provisions
set forth in the terms of such Company RSU), shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into
only the right to receive an amount solely in cash equal to the Equity Award
Cash-Out Consideration, and an amount solely in cash equal to any accumulated
and unpaid dividend equivalents, in each case, with respect to each Company
Share subject to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
(without interest and less applicable withholdings in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.6_) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than the end of the first regular payroll period
commencing following the Effective Time); _provided_ that, with respect to any
Company RSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to
Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to be paid or settled as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time without triggering a
Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment or settlement
shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such award
that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 

(c) _Company Performance Share Awards and Performance Share Unit Awards_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each award in respect of Company Shares with any
performance-based vesting requirements (other than Company PSUs) (each, a "
_Company PSA_ ") that is unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (after application of any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in
the terms of such Company PSA) (each such Company PSA, an " _Unvested Company
PSA_ "), shall be deemed to be two separate awards consisting of the Company
PSA Portion and the Company PSU Portion to be treated as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)(i) and Section_ __ _ 4.5(c)(ii)_, respectively,
provided that the holder of such Unvested Company PSA shall first have
delivered to Parent a release, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent. A portion of the Company Shares represented by the Company PSA
Portion will become vested in full and free of restrictions based upon actual
performance as determined by the Company

 



9  Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) and reasonably agreed to by the
Parent Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Such vested amount of the Company PSA Portion and each
Company PSA that is vested as of the Effective Time (taking into account the
application of any vesting acceleration provisions set forth in the terms of
such Company PSA) shall be cancelled and converted into only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and an amount in cash equal to any
accumulated and unpaid dividends, with any fractional Parent Share otherwise
issuable settled in cash in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.2(f)_) in each
case, without interest and less applicable withholdings in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 4.6_ and as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time (but in no event later than the end of the first regular payroll period
commencing immediately following the Effective Time). The Company PSU Portion
will be treated as an Unvested Company PSU as set forth in _Section_ __ _
4.5(c)(ii)_ below. The other details of this treatment, if any, will
be reasonably agreed to by the Company and Parent.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each performance share unit in respect of Company
Shares with any performance-based vesting requirements, including the Company
PSU Portions of the Unvested Company PSAs described in _Section_ __ _
4.5(c)(i)_, but otherwise excluding any other portion of the Company PSAs
(each, a " _Company PSU_ ") that is outstanding and unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after application of any vesting
acceleration provisions set forth in the terms of such Company PSU) (each such
Company PSU, an " _Unvested Company PSU_ "), shall, automatically and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a time-based
cash-settled restricted stock unit, denominated in Parent Shares. The number
of Parent Shares subject to such restricted stock unit (rounded up to the
nearest whole number) shall be equal to (x) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio. The number of Company
Shares subject to such Unvested Company PSU shall be based upon actual
performance as determined by the Company Board (or the appropriate committee
thereof) and reasonably agreed to by the Parent Board (or the appropriate
committee thereof) as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time, each such Unvested
Company PSU shall continue to be governed by substantially the same terms
and conditions (including the terms set forth on _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter, but excluding any performance conditions and any
settlement in any form other than in cash) as were applicable to such
Unvested Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iii) At the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is vested as of the
Effective Time (after application of any vesting acceleration provisions set
forth in the terms of such Company PSU) shall, automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into only
the right to receive an amount solely in cash equal to the Equity Award Cash-
Out Consideration, and an amount solely in cash equal to any accumulated and
unpaid dividend equivalents, in each case, with respect to each Company
Share subject to such earned Company PSU immediately prior to the Effective
Time as determined in the accordance with the following sentence. Such Company
PSU will be earned based upon actual performance as determined by the Company
Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) and reasonably agreed to by the
Parent Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. Such Company PSU will be paid without interest and less
applicable withholdings in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
the end of the first regular payroll period commencing

 



10  immediately following the Effective Time). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
with respect to any Company PSUs that constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted
to be paid or settled as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment or settlement shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the
terms of such award that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A
of the Code.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board, Parent, the Parent Board, or the appropriate committees of the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions
and take any actions which are necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary or appropriate to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver
Company Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to
or in settlement of the Company Options, Company RSUs, Company PSUs or Company
PSAs. If necessary, as of no later than the Effective Time, Parent shall file
a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 (or other applicable form)
with respect to the Parent Shares subject to the Company Options, Company
RSUs, Company PSUs and Company PSAs that are converted pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.5_, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such
converted awards remain outstanding.

4.6 _Withholdings_. Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration, or other amounts, payable or otherwise deliverable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amount deducted
or withheld pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.6_, and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Company Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a stockholders

with another event: (A) result in the accelerated vesting or payment of, or

statements or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) (it being
agreed that nothing disclosed in the Parent Reports will be deemed to modify
or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
5.2(b)_, and  _Section_ __ _ 5.2(l)_) or in the corresponding sections or
subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent prior
to entering into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ " and

control over financial reporting (as defined in and meeting the requirements
of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such

Intervening Event occurs and (B) the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure
to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, or

(ii) (A) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change or (B) cause the Company to
enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_, in

_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ that is not withdrawn and (y) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that any purported termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)(ii)(B)_ shall be void and of no
force and effect unless the termination is in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.3(b)_ and the Company pays to Parent the Termination Fee prior to or
concurrently with such termination.

 

(g) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. In addition, nothing contained in this

relating thereto.

 

(h) _Match Rights_. The Company Board shall not take any action set forth in

written notice of its intent to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
cause the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_ (a " _Specified Event Notice_ "),
which notice shall (x) in the case of an action contemplated by _Section_ __
_ 6.2(f)(i)_, specify in reasonable detail the circumstances related to the

or (y) in the case of an action contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)(ii)_,
(A) state that the Company has received an unsolicited Superior Proposal,

 



50  (B) specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, (C)
identify the Person making such Superior Proposal, and (D) enclose the most
recent draft of any agreements intended to be entered into in connection with

itself, constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change);

(ii) caused the Company and its Representatives to negotiate, to the extent
Parent so wishes to negotiate, in good faith during such five Business Day
period following delivery of the Specified Event Notice (the " _Notice Period_
"), with Parent concerning any revisions to the terms of this Agreement that

Proposal, as applicable; and

(iii) following the end of the Notice Period, determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that (x) in
the case of an action contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)(i)_, the failure
to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening
Event continues to be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties
to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law after taking into
account any changes to which Parent has committed in writing to make to this
Agreement, or (y) in the case of an action contemplated by _Section_ __ _
6.2(f)(ii)_, such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior
Proposal after taking into account any changes to which Parent has committed
in writing to make to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in the
case of a Specified Event Notice in response to a Superior Proposal, if,
during the Notice Period, any revisions are made to the financial or
other material terms of the Superior Proposal that is the subject of such
Specified Event Notice, the Company shall deliver to Parent a new notice
describing such revisions (and providing copies of the most recent draft of
any agreements implementing such revisions) and shall comply with the
requirements of _clause_ __ _ (i)_ and _clause_ __ _ (iii)_ of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(h)_ (except that the Notice Period for such Superior
Proposal shall be reduced from five Business Days to three Business Days).

(i) _Notice of Acquisition Proposals_. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, or any request for information relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,

has made within the 12 months preceding the date of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and

request, copies of any material written communications and draft documentation
received relating to such Acquisition Proposal and indicating the name of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request,

informed, on a timely basis, of the status and material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal, offer or request (including any
amendments thereto) and the status of any discussions or negotiations with
such Person or its Representatives (without prejudice to the restrictions set
forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ , _6.2(b)_ and the other provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_) and provide copies of all material written
communications and draft documentation received relating to such Acquisition
Proposal.

 



51 (j) _Representatives_. Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ by any Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries
shall constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ by the Company.

 

6.3 _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall promptly and jointly prepare and file
with the SEC the prospectus/proxy statement relating to the Company
Stockholder Meeting (the " _Prospectus/Proxy Statement_ ") in preliminary
form, and Parent shall as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and file
with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC
by Parent in connection with the issuance of Parent Shares in the Merger,
which shall include the Prospectus/Proxy Statement (the " _S-4 Registration
Statement_"). Parent and the Company each shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Prospectus/Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the S-4 Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after its filing (and keep the S-4
Registration Statement effective for so long as may be necessary to consummate
the Merger), and promptly thereafter the Company shall mail the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to its stockholders. Each of the Parties shall
promptly furnish to the other all non-privileged information concerning such
Party that is required by applicable Law to be included in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement so as to enable
Parent to file the S-4 Registration Statement and the Company and Parent to
file the Prospectus/Proxy Statement. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub shall promptly correct any information provided by it or any of its
Representatives for use in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement if and to the extent that such information is
discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, to be or to
have become false or misleading in any material respect. Each of the Company
and Parent shall, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof,
provide the other Party with copies of any written comments and advise the
other Party of any oral comments with respect to the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement received by such Party from the
SEC, including any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements thereto,
and shall provide the other with copies of all other material or substantive
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, each of the Company and Parent
shall provide the other Party and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to
review such document or response (including the proposed final version of such
document or response) and consider in good faith the comments of the other
Party in connection with any such document or response. None of the Company,
Parent or their respective Representatives shall agree to participate in any
material or substantive meeting or conference (including by telephone) with
the SEC, or any member of the staff thereof, in respect of the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by the
SEC, allows the other Party to participate. Parent shall advise the Company,
promptly after receipt of notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the
S-4 Registration Statement, and the issuance of any stop order relating
thereto or the suspension of the qualification of Parent Shares for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, and each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or suspension lifted,
reversed or otherwise terminated.

 



52 (b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries,
that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it or its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing
to the Company stockholders and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company and Parent will cause the S-4 Registration
Statement to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

(c) If at any time prior to the Requisite Company Vote, any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement, so that either
of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Party
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
promptly be prepared and filed with the SEC and, to the extent required under
applicable Law, disseminated to the Company stockholders.

(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
(to the extent reasonably available to the applicable Party) stockholders and
such other matters as may reasonably be necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, to the SEC or the
NYSE in connection with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4
Registration Statement.

6.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. The Company shall (a) as soon as reasonably
practicable following the date on which the S-4 Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act and the SEC staff advises that it
has no further comments on the Prospectus/Proxy Statement or that the Company
may commence mailing the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, duly call and give notice
of, and commence mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to the holders of
Company Shares as of the record date established for, a meeting of holders of
the Company Shares (the " _Company Stockholders_ _Meeting_ ") to consider and
vote upon the adoption of this Agreement, (b) as soon as reasonably
practicable (but in any event within 35 calendar days) following the
commencement of the mailing of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement pursuant to
_clause_ __ _ (a)_ above, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting,
and (c) unless there has been an Adverse Recommendation Change permitted by
and in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_, use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit proxies from the Company stockholders in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and take all other actions necessary or advisable
to secure the Requisite Company Vote; notwithstanding this _Section_ __ _
6.4_, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to
a later date to the extent the Company believes in good faith, after

 



53  consultation with Parent, that such adjournment or postponement is
reasonably necessary (i) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment
to the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is provided to the holders of Company
Shares within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit
additional proxies necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote, (iii) to
ensure that there are sufficient Company Shares represented (either in person
or by proxy) and voting to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the
business of the Company Stockholders Meeting, or (iv) otherwise where
required to comply with applicable Law. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, the

promptly as the Parties may mutually agree, acting in good faith, (C) execute
and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the

waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act and (B) make the
appropriate filings in connection with the approvals, notices or other
requirements set forth on _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)(ii)(x)_ of the

reasonable best efforts to jointly propose, negotiate, commit to and effect,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the ownership or operation by
Parent and the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries of, any portion
of the business, properties or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries; _provided, however_ , that neither Parent nor the
Company shall be required to propose, commit to or effect any action that is
not conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger;  _provided further_ ,
that Parent shall not be required to propose, commit to or effect any sale,
divestiture, "hold separate" arrangement or similar disposition of, or
behavioral remedy in respect of, any assets or business of either Parent or
the Company (or group of such assets or businesses) that, in the aggregate,
generated net sales (as the term "net sales" is utilized by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, in connection with the preparation of the
Parent Reports or Company Reports, as applicable) in excess of $300,000,000
during the most recently completed fiscal year of Parent or the Company, as
applicable, immediately preceding the date of this Agreement, as reflected
in  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)(ii)(y)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (a "
_Burdensome Condition_ "). The Company, Parent and Merger Sub and any of their
respective Affiliates shall not take any action with the intention to, or
that would reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or under any
other Antitrust Laws, or the obtaining of approval of the DOJ, FTC or any
other applicable Governmental Entity of any jurisdiction of the Other
Required Antitrust Approvals, as necessary (including, in the case of Parent
and Merger Sub, acquiring or merging with any business, Person or division
thereof, or entering into a definitive agreement with respect thereto, if
doing so could reasonably be expected to have such effect).

(iii) Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and implementing
the strategy for obtaining any and all necessary antitrust consents or
approvals and shall have the right to direct all matters with
any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_
that Parent shall consult and cooperate with the Company with respect to such
strategy and shall consider the Companys views in good faith. Each Party
shall permit the other Parties to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each of Parent and the Company will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, any proposed
substantive communication to any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions (including all of the information relating to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the
other Transactions (including the Prospectus/Proxy Statement). In exercising
the foregoing rights, each of the Parties shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. In addition, neither Parent nor the Company shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, commit to or agree with
any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws or enter into a timing
agreement with any Governmental Entity, without the prior written consent of
the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed and Parent shall be permitted to pull and refile any filing made
under the HSR Act, or any other Antitrust Laws, prior to the End Date with the
prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



55 (b) _Information_. The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the
other, use reasonable best efforts to furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may reasonably be necessary or advisable in connection
with the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, the S-4 Registration Statement or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the Transactions;
_provided_ that the limitations set forth in the provisos to _Section_ __ _
6.6_ shall apply to the Companys and Parents obligations, _mutatis
mutandis_. In addition, each of the Company and Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide the information concerning it necessary to
enable the Company and Parent to prepare required pro forma
financial statements and related footnotes in connection with the preparation
of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement and the S-4 Registration Statement.

 

(c) _Status_.

(i) Subject to applicable Law and as required by any Governmental Entity, the
Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the Transactions, including promptly furnishing the
other with copies of written notices or other communications received by
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from
any Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and
Parent each shall give prompt notice to the other of any change, fact or
condition of which it becomes aware that would reasonably be likely to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
respectively, or any breach by such Party of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder that would reasonably be expected to result
in the failure of any condition to the other Partys obligations to effect the
Merger hereunder. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, neither the Company nor
Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents
to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to
the Transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(ii) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_ or _Section_
__ _ 6.5(c)(i)_, the Company and Parent shall each promptly advise the other
Party if it obtains knowledge of (A) any written notice or other written
communication from any counterparty to a Contract with regard to any action,
consent, approval or waiver that is required to be taken or obtained with
respect to such Contract in connection with the consummation of the Merger
(and provide a copy thereof) or (B) any written notice or other written
communication from any other Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with the Merger (and provide a copy
thereof). The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any
written notice or other written communication received after the date of this
Agreement from any party to any Material Contract to the effect that such
Party has terminated or intends to terminate or otherwise materially and
adversely modify its relationship with the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Partys failure to comply with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(c)(ii)_ ( _provided_ that such failure was not in bad
faith) shall not constitute a failure of any condition set forth in _Article
VII_ to be satisfied, or otherwise provide any other Party the right not to
effect the Transactions, except to the extent that any other provision of this
Agreement independently provides such right.

 



56 (d) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_, _6.5(b)_ or _6.5(c)_ or any
other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the
Company take or permit any of its Subsidiaries to take (unless in each case
Parent directs the Company to do so) any action that would result in a
Burdensome Condition. 

6.6 _Access and Reports_. Subject to any applicable Law, upon reasonable
notice, each Party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the
other Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its employees,
properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such period, shall
(and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other Party all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested, _provided_ that no investigation pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require either Party (i) to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of such Party would result in the disclosure of any Trade Secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if such Party shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
to permit any intrusive environmental sampling on, at or in any of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or any of its Subsidiaries, or
(iii) to disclose any privileged information or information subject to
attorney work product protection of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ to the contrary, each
Party shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents of third
parties that are necessary to permit such access or make such disclosure and
shall otherwise use reasonable best efforts to permit such access or
disclosure, including pursuant to the use of "clean team" arrangements
pursuant to which certain Representatives of the other Party could be provided
access to any such information. All requests for information made pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall be directed to the general counsel of or other
Person designated by each Party. All such information shall be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.7 _Stock Exchange Listing and Delisting_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Parent Shares to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
prior to the Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies
of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Shares
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than 10 calendar days after the Closing Date.

 

6.8 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release, and thereafter, unless an Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred, and except with respect to press releases and other
public statements in connection with _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (to the extent
expressly permitted pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 6.2_), the Company and
Parent each shall consult with the other prior to issuing any press releases
or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the
other Transactions and prior to making any filings with any third party
and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange or
interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto, except as may be required
by Law or by obligations

 



57  pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any national securities
exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the request of any
Governmental Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, without prior
consultation, each Party (a) may, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.2_, communicate
information that is not confidential information of any other Party with
financial analysts, investors and media representatives in the ordinary
course of business and in a manner consistent with its past practice in
compliance with applicable Law and (b) may disseminate information included in
a press release or other document already approved for external distribution
by the other Parties.

6.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide
to each Company Employee for so long as such Company Employee remains an
employee of Parent or the Surviving Corporation during the Continuation
Period, (i) base salary or regular hourly wage and annual incentive
opportunities that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the base salary
or regular hourly wage and annual incentive opportunities provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company Employee immediately before the
Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits (including the value of
equity-based awards but excluding defined benefit plan and retiree welfare
benefits) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided by
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company Employee immediately before
the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the requirements of this
sentence shall not apply to Company Employees who are covered by a Company
Labor Agreement.

 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and benefit
entitlement (but excluding benefit accruals under a defined benefit
plan) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_
"), each Company Employee will be credited with his or her years of service
with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to the extent
such service was recognized by the Company and its Subsidiaries under any
similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated or
was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, to the extent such Company Employee is eligible to participate in a
New Plan following the Effective Time, and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, (i) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
(including by directing its third party insurance providers or third party
administrators) to waive any waiting time in any and all New Plans of the
same type as any Company Benefit Plans in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the consummation of the Transactions (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered
dependents, unless such conditions would not have been waived under
the comparable Old Plans. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Employee to be given credit, under the applicable New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits, for amounts
paid prior to the Effective Time during the year in which the Effective Time
occurs under a corresponding Old Plan during the same period for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents as
though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the New Plan.

 



58 (c) Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Companys
Executive Severance Benefit Plan, effective as of July 28, 2014, and shall
honor all obligations there under, in accordance with their terms, and, during
the Continuation Period, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
shall provide or cause to be provided, to each Company Employee for so long
as such Company Employee remains an employee of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation during the Continuation Period, severance benefits that are no
less favorable than severance benefits set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(d) Subject to Section 409A of the Code, Parent and the Company hereby agree
that a "change of control" or "change in control" within the meaning of each
Company Benefit Plan (or an event of similar effect under the terms of such
Company Benefit Plan) will occur upon the Closing.

 

(e) Annual bonuses for the year in which the Closing occurs shall be treated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, will (i) confer upon any
Company Employee or any other Person any right to continue in the employ or
service of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or
will interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Company Employee or
any Person at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, (ii)
constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or any employee benefit
or compensation plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates, (iii) obligate
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent to maintain any
particular compensation or benefit plan, program arrangement, policy
or contract, or (iv) prevent Parent, the Company, or any of their Affiliates
from amending or terminating any of their benefit plans in accordance with
their terms and any applicable Law. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ will create
any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former service provider
of the Company or its Affiliates, or any beneficiaries, dependents, or
collective bargaining representative thereof, or in any other Person.

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall fulfil
any notification and bargaining requirements with respect to the Transactions
under any Company Labor Agreements.

6.10 _Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such expense, except (a)
that expenses incurred in connection with (i) the filing fee for the S-4
Registration Statement and printing and mailing the Prospectus/Proxy Statement
and the S-4 Registration Statement and (ii) all statutory filing fees under
the HSR Act shall be shared equally by Parent and the Company and (b) as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement.

 



59 6.11 _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __ _ _ _Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each other Person who, at the request or for the benefit of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was previously serving as a
director or officer or fiduciary of any other Person or any benefit plan of
the Company or any benefit plan of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company (in
each case, when acting in such capacity), determined as of the Effective Time
(the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, penalties, amounts paid in settlement (including all interest,
assessments and other charges) or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary of the Company would have been permitted under Delaware
law and under its certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other governing
documents in effect on the date of this Agreement to indemnify such Person
(and Parent shall also advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and disbursements) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_ the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides
an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined by a
final and nonappealable judicial determination that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder or thereunder).

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _paragraph
(a)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation
of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

(c) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) regarding elimination of liability
of directors, indemnification of directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries
and agents and advancement of fees, costs and expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
honor and comply with their respective obligations under any indemnification
agreement with any Indemnified Party in effect as of (and disclosed to Parent
prior to) the date of this Agreement, and not amend, repeal or otherwise
modify any such agreement in any manner that would adversely affect any right
of any Indemnified Party thereunder.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies for the extension
of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies with a claims period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related
to any period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage no
less favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified Parties than the
Companys existing

 



60  policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company
expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company and
the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time the DandO
Insurance in place as of the date of this Agreement with benefits and levels
of coverage no less favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified
Parties than that provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date
of this Agreement, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use its reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement), _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of the
amount set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.11(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter;
and, _provided further_ that if the annual premium of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_
shall be in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws.

 

6.12 _Company Debt Arrangements_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, at Parents
written request, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with, and provide all reasonable assistance to, Parent in connection

desirable in order for Parent to terminate, retire, repay, defease,
restructure, exchange, repurchase or redeem, effective at or after the
Effective Time, some or all amounts outstanding under or commitments issued
pursuant to (i) the Company Credit Agreement and/or (ii) the Company
Indenture, and at such time terminate any or all such agreements, which
cooperation and assistance shall include arranging for (A) the optional

Company, or (B) the repayment or prepayment by Parent or any of Parents
Subsidiaries of any amounts outstanding under the Company Credit Agreement on
or after the Closing Date (and in connection therewith, obtaining the
termination of all commitments under and the release of all guarantees and
Liens with respect thereto), _provided_ that the consummation of any

otherwise act to eliminate (or to the extent elimination is not possible,
minimize) the effects of such statute or regulation on such Transactions.

DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
NEGOTIATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE

72  ANY FINANCING SOURCE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS, THE
FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES WITH RESPECT THERETO). EACH PARTY

provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of

a remedy (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity, and
(ii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions
and without that right neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into
this Agreement. The Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, and not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.
The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its
right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under
this Agreement, including, subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(c)_, monetary
damages in the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ are not
available or otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ shall require any Party to institute any proceeding
for (or limit any Partys right to institute any proceeding for) specific
performance under this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ before exercising any
termination right under _Article VIII_ (and pursuing damages after such
termination) nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_ or anything contained in this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_
restrict or limit any Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Article VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.5(c)_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such order or injunction.

Agreement, each of the Parties agrees (i) that all actions, claims, suits or
proceedings in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, directly involving
any of the Financing Sources arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
the Transactions, the Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto (A) shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction and (B) shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction

 



73  of the courts of the State of New York and the federal courts of the United
States of America located in the State, City and County of New York (and each

jurisdiction of such state and federal courts sitting in the State of New
