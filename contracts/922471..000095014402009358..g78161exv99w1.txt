(collectively with Seller, the "Seller Parties"), Cendant Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent") and Cherokee Acquisition Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Buyer").   W
I T N E S S E T H:   WHEREAS, Seller and its Subsidiaries conduct automotive

Caribbean region, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, directly or
through various Franchisees, Dealers, licensees and sub-licensees under the
brand names Budget and Ryder, including the rental of automobiles, trucks and
other vehicles in the daily rental market (excluding any business conducted
in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, collectively, the "Acquired
Business");   WHEREAS, on July 29, 2002, all of Seller Parties filed
voluntary petitions (the "Petitions") for relief commencing cases (the
"Chapter 11 Cases") under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code,
11 U.S.C. sections 101 et seq. (as amended, the "Bankruptcy Code"), in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy
Court"); and   WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase and assume from Seller
Parties, and Seller Parties desire to sell, convey, assign and transfer to
Buyer, the assets and properties of Seller Parties relating to the Acquired
Business specified herein, together with certain specified obligations and
liabilities relating thereto, all in the manner and subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in the Ancillary Agreements and in accordance
with sections 105, 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants herein contained and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:   ARTICLE 1  DEFINITIONS   Section 1.1 Defined Terms. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:   "13-Week Cash Flow Projections" means, with respect to the
relevant 13-week period, a projected statement of cash flow for the
operations of Seller Entities for such period in respect of the Acquired
Business, detailing the sources and uses of such cash flow, in form and scope
consistent with the Initial 13-Week Cash Flow Projections.   "363 Order"
means an order of the Bankruptcy Court, in substance and form satisfactory to
Buyer under this Agreement pursuant to sections 105 and 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code and not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, unless otherwise
agreed among Buyer and Seller Parties. Subject, in the case of clauses
(a)(ii)(A) and (b) below to changes that are reasonably acceptable to Buyer,
the 363 Order shall provide, among other things: (a) that the transfer of the
Acquired Assets by Seller Parties to Buyer and the assumption of the
Assumed  Liabilities by Buyer from Seller Parties: (i) is or will be a
legal, valid and effective transfer of the Acquired Assets; (ii) vests or
will vest Buyer with good title to the Acquired Assets free and clear of all
Liabilities and Encumbrances (including Liabilities and Encumbrances (A) that
purport to give to any Person a right or option to retain any rights in or to
Seller Parties\' Trademarks or Marks and Logos or other Intellectual
Property, (B) that purport to give to any Person a right or option to effect
any forfeiture, modification, right of first refusal, repurchase or
termination of Seller Parties\' or Buyer\'s interest in the Acquired Assets
or any similar rights or (C) in respect of Taxes), except those expressly
assumed or permitted by Buyer hereunder; and (iii) constitutes reasonably
equivalent value and fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under
the laws of the United States, any state, territory, possession, or the
District of Columbia; (b) that all Persons, including, but not limited to,
all debt security holders, equity security holders, governmental, tax and
regulatory authorities, lenders, parties to or beneficiaries under any
Benefit Plan, trade and other creditors, asserting or having Liabilities or
Encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever against any of Seller Parties
or the Acquired Assets (whether legal or equitable, secured or unsecured,
matured or unmatured, contingent or non-contingent, senior or subordinated),
arising under or out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to,
Seller Parties, the Acquired Assets, the operation of Seller Parties\'
businesses prior to the Closing Date, or the transfer of the Acquired Assets
to Buyer, other than the Assumed Liabilities and Permitted
Encumbrances, shall be forever barred, estopped and permanently enjoined from
asserting, prosecuting or otherwise pursuing against Buyer, Parent, their
Affiliates, any of the Acquired Companies or their Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective assets, property, successors or assigns, or the Acquired
Assets, Seller Parties\' Liabilities (other than Assumed Liabilities) to such
Persons or such Person\'s Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances)
against Seller Parties or their respective property; (c) that the Bankruptcy
Court retains jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this Agreement in all
respects, including retaining jurisdiction to protect Buyer and its
Affiliates against any of the Excluded Liabilities; (d) that the provisions
of the 363 Order are nonseverable and mutually dependent; (e) that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are undertaken by Buyer in good
faith, as that term is used in section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code; and
(f)(i) a declaration that no Acquired Company nor any of their respective
assets or properties are directly or indirectly liable for or subject to any
Undisclosed Joint Liability or Liability relating to Taxes that has been or
may be asserted against any Seller Party, their estates, or any Affiliate of
Seller Parties (other than the Acquired Companies) or of the Acquired
Companies to the extent that any such Liability is based in whole or in part
upon the fact that any such Acquired Company was at any time an Affiliate of
Seller Parties or a member of the same affiliated group (within the
meaning of section 1504 of the Code) or state combined, unitary or similar
group of Seller Parties or any of their Affiliates (other than the Acquired
Companies), and enjoin any and all holders of any such Liability from
asserting, prosecuting or otherwise pursuing any such Liability against any
Acquired Company or any of their respective assets or properties; and (ii)
provided, however, that if the Bankruptcy Court will refuse to approve a 363
Order containing the declaration specified above in clause (f)(i) above the
363 Order shall provide that Seller Parties shall jointly and severally
indemnify Buyer, Parent and their successors and assigns, affiliates,
employees, directors, agents and representatives from and against and shall
reimburse the same for and in respect of any and all Liability relating to
Taxes referred to in clause (f)(i) above, including, without limitation, all
penalties, interest, costs and expenses (including attorney fees) incurred
for, in connection with    2  or in respect of such Taxes. The 363 Order
and the 365 Order may be consolidated in a single order of the Bankruptcy
Court.   "365 Order" means an order or orders of the Bankruptcy Court
in substance and form satisfactory to Buyer, approving the assumption by
Seller Parties, and assignment by Seller Parties to Buyer, of all Assumed
Contracts and Assumed Leases pursuant to sections 105 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code and not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, unless
otherwise agreed among Buyer and Seller Parties. The 365 Order shall provide:
(a) that all defaults of Seller Parties under the Assumed Contracts and
Assumed Leases arising or accruing prior to the date of the 365 Order
(without giving effect to any acceleration clauses or any default provisions
in such contracts of a kind specified in section 365(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy
Code) have been cured or will be promptly cured by Seller Parties and that
Buyer shall have no liability or obligation with respect to any default or
obligation arising or accruing prior to Closing; provided, however, that to
the extent such Assumed Contracts or Assumed Leases are in default as a
result of any failure to post, procure, or maintain in an adequate amount
performance or surety bonds or any other form of financial assurance,
including letters of credit and cash deposits, Buyer shall post, procure, and
maintain such performance or surety bonds and (b) that the Assumed Contracts
and Assumed Leases will be assumed and assigned to, and remain in full force
and effect for the benefit of, Buyer, notwithstanding any provision in such
Assumed Contracts or Assumed Leases or in applicable Law (including those of
a type described in sections 365(b)(2) and (f) of the Bankruptcy Code) that
prohibits, restricts, or conditions in any way such assignment or transfer
including, change of control, payment or Liabilities triggered by the sale of
the Acquired Assets or any portion thereof, use and going dark restrictions.
The 365 Order and the 363 Order may be consolidated in a single order of the
Bankruptcy Court.   "A.I. Credit Corporation Premium Finance Arrangement"
means the Premium Finance Agreement, dated June 20, 2002, between Seller
Parties and A.I. Credit Corporation.   "Accounting Firm" means an
independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller
Parties. If Buyer and Seller Parties cannot mutually agree on the identity of
the Accounting Firm, the Accounting Firm shall be selected by lot from
accounting firms of recognized national and international standing, other
than Ernst and Young LLP or any Affiliate thereof or the auditor of Parent,
Buyer, Seller Parties or any of their Affiliates (it being understood that if
there are no accounting firms among the New York offices of one of the "Big

Employee is a party to (or otherwise the beneficiary of) any agreement or
arrangement which could give rise to any such employee becoming entitled to

Section 3.18(c) of the Seller Parties Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true

where applicable, Seller Parties have delivered or made available to Buyer:

any reports or summaries required under applicable Law, (iv) the most recent
determination letter received from the IRS with respect to each Benefit Plan
intended to qualify under section 401 of the Code and (v) any
material communications to employees. Each Benefit Plan has been established,
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code and any analogous
Law of the relevant jurisdictions to the extent applicable. Each Pension Plan
which is intended to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so
qualified, and, to the    48  knowledge of Seller Parties, no
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in revocation
of any such favorable determination letter. The Seller Parties have caused to
be timely filed with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation any required
notice of a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) that has
occurred with respect to each Pension Plan that is intended to be qualified

section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by any Seller Entity or any ERISA
Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that
presents a material risk to Buyer of incurring any liability under Title IV
or section 302 of ERISA in respect of Seller or any ERISA Affiliate, other
than liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(which premiums have been paid when due). Insofar as the representation made
in this Section 3.18(d) applies to sections 4064, 4069 or 4204 of Title IV of
ERISA, it is made with respect to any employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement subject to Title IV of ERISA to which Seller or any
ERISA Affiliate made, or was required to make, contributions during the five-
year period ending on the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior
to the Closing Date. No Benefit Plan is a single-employer plan (as defined in
section 3(41) of ERISA) subject to Title IV or section 302 of ERISA except
the Budget Group, Inc. Employees\' Pension Plan (the " Budget Pension Plan").
With respect to the Budget Pension Plan, as reported in the January 2002
Actuarial Valuation Report as of January 1, 2001 for the Plan Year and
Taxable Year Ending December 31, 2001 (the "Actuarial Valuation Report"), as
of January 1, 2001 the market value of assets held in trust with respect to
the Budget Pension Plan exceeds the actuarial accrued liability thereunder,
based on the actuarial assumptions used for ongoing plan funding purposes in
the Actuarial Valuation Report.   (e) The PBGC has not instituted
proceedings to terminate any Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or
section 302 of ERISA (each, a "Title IV Plan"), and no condition exists that
presents a material risk that such proceedings will be instituted.   (f)
Except as set forth in Section 3.18(f) of the Seller Parties Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of any
Seller Entity to sale or retention bonuses, severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due, any such employee or
officer or (iii) require the immediate funding or financing of
any compensation or benefits which, in each case, could reasonably become
a Liability of Buyer. Except as set forth in Section 3.18(f) of the Seller
Parties Disclosure Schedule, no amounts payable under the Benefit Plans will
fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of section
162(m) or section 280G of the Code.   (g) Section 3.18(g) of the Seller
Parties Disclosure Schedule sets forth each Title IV Plan covering current or
former employees of any Seller Entity that is a "multiemployer plan," as
defined in section 3(37) of ERISA. With respect to each such Title IV Plan
that is a "multiemployer pension plan": (i) no Seller Party nor any ERISA
Affiliate has made or suffered a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial
withdrawal," as such terms are respectively defined in sections 4203 and 4205
of ERISA (or any liability resulting therefrom has been satisfied in full),
(ii) no event has occurred that presents a material risk of a partial
withdrawal, (iii) no Seller Party   49  nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
contingent liability under section 4204 of ERISA and (iv) to the knowledge of
Seller Parties, no circumstances exist that present a material risk that any
such plan will go into reorganization.   (h) Except as set forth in Section
3.18(h) of the Seller Parties Disclosure Schedule, no Benefit Plan provides
medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits (whether or not
insured) for any present or former employees of any Seller Entity for periods
extending beyond their retirement or other termination of service, other than
(i) coverage mandated by applicable Law, (ii) death benefits under any
"pension plan" or (iii) benefits the full cost of which is borne by such
employee of any Seller Entity (or his or her beneficiary). Except as set
forth in Section 3.18(h) of the Seller Parties Disclosure Schedule, no Seller
Entity has ever represented, promised or contracted (whether in oral or
written form) to any employee(s) that such employee(s) would be provided with
retiree health or life benefits which could reasonably be expected to result
in Liability to Buyer.   (i) No Seller Entity, any ERISA Affiliate, or any
Benefit Plan, any trust created thereunder nor any trustee or administrator
thereof has engaged in a transaction or has taken or failed to take any
action in connection with which any such Person or any party dealing with the
Benefit Plans or any such trust could be subject to either a civil penalty
assessed pursuant to section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant
to section 4975 or 4976 of the Code which could reasonably become a Liability
of Buyer.   (j) With respect to each Foreign Benefit Plan: (i) all employer
and employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by
the terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made, or if
applicable, accrued in accordance with GAAP, (ii) the fair market value of
the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of each insurer
for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the book reserve
established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit
obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to all current and former
participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions and
valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to such
Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall
cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than such benefit
obligations and (iii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has
been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
Governmental Bodies.   (k) There has been no material failure of a U.S.
Benefit Plan that is a group health plan (as defined in section 5000(b)(1) of
the Code) to meet the requirements of section 4980B(f) of the Code with
respect to a qualified beneficiary (as defined in section 4980B(g) of the
Code). No Seller Party nor any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to a
nonconforming group health plan (as defined in section 5000(c) of the Code)
and no ERISA Affiliate of any Seller Party has incurred a tax under section
5000(a) of the Code which could reasonably become a liability of Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries.   (l) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(f) of the
Seller Parties Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending or, to the knowledge
of Seller Parties, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any
Benefit Plan, by any employee or beneficiary under any Benefit   50  Plan
or otherwise involving any Benefit Plan (other than routine and
immaterial claims for benefits).   Section 3.19 Labor Relations and
Employment.   (a) Except to the extent set forth in Section 3.19(a) of

extensive process undertaken by Seller Parties to identify and negotiate a

transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors and other interested

the requirements of the Bidding Procedures; provided that such Person
executes a confidentiality agreement in accordance with the Bidding

shall make available to Seller Parties and the Excluded Companies any

premiums have been paid by Seller Entities in respect of any Assumed
Liability, to the extent Seller Parties are determined to be liable therefor
or such Acquired Insurance Contract provides insurance coverage with respect
to any Excluded Liability. Buyer shall submit any claims under each Acquired
Insurance Contract to the relevant insurance company or companies, and Buyer
shall have the sole and absolute authority to manage any and all claims filed
under any Acquired Insurance Contract. Seller Parties shall cooperate with

questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,

or other reproductions in whole or in part of such tangible material. If
requested by Seller, an appropriate officer of Buyer or Parent will certify
to Seller that all such Seller Evaluation Material has been so redelivered or
destroyed. Notwithstanding the delivery or destruction of the Seller
Evaluation Material required by this Section 5.13(e), all duties and
obligations existing under this Section 5.13 (including with respect to any
oral Seller Evaluation Material) will remain in full force and effect.

the foregoing shall not prohibit a solicitation directed at the public in
general, by a professional employment agency or to any employee who

6.1 Benefit and Employment Matters.   (a) Prior to the Closing Date (to be
effective on the Closing Date), Buyer will offer regular full-time or part-
time employment, as applicable, to each full-time and part-time Seller
Parties Employee with comparable compensation, benefits and in the same
geographic area as applicable to such Seller Parties Employee immediately
before the Closing Date. Seller Parties Employees who accept offers of
employment made by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.1(a) and commence
employment with Buyer and its Affiliates immediately upon Closing shall be
referred to herein as the "Affected Employees;" provided, however, that any
Seller Parties Employee who is not actively at work on the Closing Date on
account of sickness, vacation or short-term disability shall be deemed a
"Affected Employee" upon his or her return to active employment with Buyer
after the Closing Date. Except as specifically provided for in
this Agreement, Seller Parties shall be responsible for and shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates from any liabilities
relating to any current or former employee of Seller   81  Parties who is
not an Affected Employee (including, without limitation, any liabilities
arising under any Benefit Plan or other compensation program, arrangement or
agreement of Seller Parties). Seller Parties shall make their employees
available to Buyer, at reasonable times and in a manner intended not to
disrupt ongoing operations, for the purpose of making employment offers
to such employees.   (b) With respect to those employee benefit plans of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries ("Buyer Plans") in which Buyer, in its sole
discretion, shall determine that Affected Employees may participate as of or
following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
credit the prior service of the Affected Employees with Seller Parties for
purposes of eligibility and vesting under such Buyer Plans to the extent that
such service was recognized under the analogous Benefit Plans; provided,
however, that such service need not be credited to the extent it would result
in a duplication of benefits. Affected Employees shall also be given credit
for any deductible or co-payment amounts paid in respect of the Buyer Plan
year in which the Closing occurs, to the extent that, following the Closing,
they participate in any Buyer Plan during such plan year for which
deductibles or co-payments are required. Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, waive (i) any preexisting condition restriction (other than
a restriction to which the Affected Employee is subject immediately prior to
the time of the Closing) under the terms of the analogous Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing or (ii) any waiting period limitation which
would otherwise be applicable to an Affected Employee on or after the Closing
to the extent such Affected Employee had satisfied any similar waiting period
limitation under an analogous Benefit Plan prior to the Closing.   (c) With
respect to any Affected Employees who are given notice of termination of
employment during the first nine months immediately following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall provide each such Affected Employee with severance benefits
equal to those provided as of the date hereof under the applicable Seller
Entity severance plan in which such Affected Employee
currently participates.   (d) Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed
to require that the employment of any Affected Employee be continued for any
specific period of time after the Closing Date. Except as expressly provided
in this Section 6.1, nothing in this Section 6.1, express or implied, shall
be construed to prevent Buyer or its Affiliates from (i) terminating, or
modifying the terms of employment of, any Affected Employee following the
Closing Date or (ii) terminating or modifying to any extent or in any respect
employee benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement that Buyer or its
Affiliates, as applicable, may establish or maintain. Buyer shall be
responsible for and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates from any liabilities arising from the termination, following the
Closing Date, of any Affected Employee.   (e) Prior to Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a list of all employees who have suffered an "employment
loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) during the three months prior to the
Closing Date.   (f) Subject to the consummation of the transaction pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, effective as of Closing, Buyer shall be
obligated to provide, or to cause Parent to provide, the benefits set forth
on Schedule 6.1(f).   82   (g) With respect to the following plans:

relating thereto and shall contribute to such plan with  respect to such
operations for substantially the same number of  contribution base units for
which Seller Parties had an obligation to  contribute to such plan.   (ii)

section 4204(c) of the Employee Retirement Income  Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), Buyer will provide to each  Multiemployer Plan, for a
period of five plan years commencing with the  first plan year beginning
after the Closing, a bond issued by a  corporate surety company that is an
acceptable surety for purposes of  section 412 of ERISA, or an amount held in
escrow by a bank or similar  financial institution satisfactory to such
Multiemployer Plan, or such  other security as may be permitted under section
4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA  or regulations thereunder, in an amount equal to the
greater of:   (A) the average annual contribution required to be  made by
the Seller Parties to the Multiemployer Plan with  respect to the operations
thereunder for the three plan years  preceding the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, or   (B) the annual contribution that the Seller Parties 
were required to make with respect to the operations under the  Multiemployer
Plan for the last plan year before the plan year  in which the Closing
occurs,  which applicable bond or escrow shall be paid to such Multiemployer
Plan if Buyer withdraws from such Multiemployer Plan, or fails to make a
contribution to such Multiemployer Plan when due, at any time during the
first five plan years beginning after the Closing.   (iii) If Buyer
withdraws from a Multiemployer Plan in a  complete withdrawal or a partial
withdrawal with respect to the union  employees within the period referred to
in the preceding subsection  (ii), Buyer will be primarily liable and Seller
Parties agree to be  secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability the
Seller Parties  would have had at the Closing Date to such Multiemployer
Plan, but for  the application of section 4204 of ERISA, if the withdrawal
liability  of Buyer with respect to such Multiemployer Plan is not paid.  
83   (iv) Buyer agrees that any action on its part that causes  withdrawal
liability (either partial or complete) during the period  referred to in
subsection (ii) hereof shall be for valid business  reasons only. In the
event of a subsequent sale of the assets of the  Acquired Business by Buyer
during such period, Buyer agrees to comply  with the provisions of section
4204(a)(1) of ERISA.   (v) If all, or substantially all, of the Seller
Parties\'  assets are distributed, or if the Seller Parties are liquidated
before  the end of the first five plan years beginning after Closing, then, 
except as may otherwise be required by law, Seller Parties shall  provide a
bond, an amount in escrow or such other security as may be  permitted under
section 4204(a)(1)(B) of ERISA or regulations  thereunder, equal to the
present value of the withdrawal liability  Seller Parties would have had but
for the application of section 4204  of ERISA, which bond, amount in escrow
or other security may be applied  toward the satisfaction of Seller\'s
secondary liability described in  subsection (iii) hereof.   (vi) Buyer
agrees to provide the applicable Seller Parties  with reasonable advance
notice of any action or event which could  result in the imposition of
withdrawal liability contemplated by this  Section 6.1(g), and in any event
Buyer shall immediately furnish such  Seller Parties with a copy of any
notice of withdrawal liability it may  receive with respect to a
Multiemployer Plan, together with all the  pertinent details. In the event
that any such withdrawal liability  shall be assessed against Buyer, Buyer
further agrees to provide the  applicable Seller Parties with reasonable
advance notice of any  intention on the part of Buyer not to make full
payment of any  withdrawal liability when the same shall become due.  
Section 6.2 Books and Records; Personnel. For a period of six years after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall maintain all Business Records that are transferred
to Buyer hereunder. At all times during which Buyer maintains such Business
Records (including electronic access to the extent such Business Records are
in electronic form and the information can be provided separate and apart
from all other information relating to Buyer, any of its Affiliates or their
respective businesses), Buyer shall allow Seller Parties and
their accountants and counsel access to all such Business Records, properties
and personnel that are reasonably required in the administration of the
Chapter 11 Cases or anticipation of, or preparation for, any existing or
future Action involving a Seller Party, Tax Return preparation or defense,
litigation or Excluded Liability. Such access shall be afforded during
regular business hours and upon reasonable written notice at Buyer\'s
principal place of business or at any location where such Business Records
are stored; provided, however, that any such access shall not interfere with
the normal conduct of the business or operations of Buyer and its Affiliates.
Seller Parties shall be responsible for any actual out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with granting
Seller Parties access to such Business Records, properties and personnel
pursuant to this Section 6.2. If, prior to the expiration of such six-year
period, Buyer proposes to dispose of any such Business Records, Buyer shall
(and Parent shall cause Buyer to) provide Seller with written notice and, if
requested, shall deliver the same to Seller at Seller\'s expense.   84  
Section 6.3 Section 338(h)(10) Elections.   (a) Seller, in respect of each
or any Seller Party, if so instructed by Buyer, shall jointly make a timely
election under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable elections
under state and local income tax Law) with Buyer with respect to any domestic
Acquired Company (individually, any such election referred to herein as an
"Election" and, collectively, such elections referred to herein as the
"Elections"). On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller (in respect of each
Seller Party that Buyer has instructed Seller to make an Election pursuant to
this Section 6.3(a)) and Buyer shall exchange completed and executed original
copies of IRS Form 8023 and any applicable similar state or local forms with
respect to the Elections. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
required to make an Election with respect to any Acquired Company if the
aggregate tax basis of the assets of such Acquired Company exceeds the
"Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" allocable to such Acquired Company unless such
Election has no adverse Tax effect on Seller or any Seller Party.   (b) In
connection with any Election with respect to an Acquired Company, as promptly
as practicable after the date hereof, Buyer and Seller shall agree to: (i) a
determination of the "Aggregate Deemed Sales Price" and the "Adjusted Grossed
Up Basis" (each, as defined under applicable Treasury Regulations) with
respect to any such Acquired Company and (ii) an allocation of each such
Aggregate Deemed Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed Up Basis among the assets
of any such Acquired Company, which allocations shall be made in accordance
with section 338 of the Code and any applicable Treasury Regulations and the
portion of the Cash Purchase Price, if any, and the Assumed Liabilities, if
any, attributable to such Acquired Company that have been allocated to
such Acquired Company pursuant to Section 5.9 (each, a "Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statement"). If Buyer and Seller cannot agree on the amount(s) and
allocation(s) described in the preceding sentence, such amount(s) and
allocation(s) shall be prepared by the Accounting Firm. Any Section
338(h)(10) Allocation Statement prepared pursuant to this Section 6.3(b)
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Buyer and each Seller Party.  
(c) Buyer and each Seller Party: (i) shall be bound by the determinations of
the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statements determined pursuant to Section
6.3(b) consistently therewith for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii)
shall prepare and file all Tax Returns to be filed with any Tax authority in
a manner consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statements and
(iii) shall take no position inconsistent with the Section 338(h)(10)
Allocation Statements in any Tax Return, any Action before any Tax authority
or otherwise. In the event that a Section 338(h)(10) Allocation Statement is
disputed by any Tax authority, the party receiving notice of such dispute
shall promptly notify and consult with the other party hereto
concerning resolution of such dispute.   (d) Each Seller Party and Buyer
shall cooperate in the preparation and timely filing of (i) Forms 8023 with
respect to any Election and any comparable state or local forms or reports
and (ii) to the extent permissible by or required by Law, any corrections,
amendments, or supplements thereto. To the extent necessary for the valid
filing of any such corrections, amendments, supplements, forms or reports,
each Seller Party and Buyer shall cooperate in the timely execution thereof.
Neither Seller nor Buyer shall, or shall permit any of their Affiliates to,
take any action to modify any of the forms or reports (including any
corrections, amendments,   85  or supplements thereto) that are required
for the making of any Election after their execution or to modify or revoke
any of the Elections following the filing of the Forms 8023 without the prior
written consent of the other party.   (e) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 6.3, the amount, if any, paid by Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.5(b) and allocated to an Acquired Company (for which an
Election has been made pursuant to Section 6.3(a)) pursuant to Section 5.9(d)
shall be: (i) taken into account for purposes of determining Aggregate Deemed
Sales Price and Adjusted Grossed Up Basis and (ii) allocated by Buyer and
Seller among the assets of such Acquired Company in accordance with, and
subject to, the principles and obligations set forth in this Section 6.3.  
Section 6.4 Tax Cooperation. Seller Parties and Buyer agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly
as practicable, such information (including access to books and records)
and assistance relating to the Acquired Assets (including the Acquired
Companies) as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns
(including any Transfer Tax Return required to be filed pursuant to Section
5.10(b)), for the preparation of any audit and for the prosecution or defense
of any Action or other matter related to Taxes or any Tax Return. Any
information obtained under this Section 6.4 shall be kept confidential except
(i) as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding or
(ii) as may be consented to by Seller Parties or Buyer, as applicable.
Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable,
cause the Acquired Companies and their Subsidiaries to prepare and provide to
Seller a package of Tax information materials, including schedules and work
papers (the "Tax Package") required by Seller to enable Seller to prepare and
file its U.S. federal consolidated (and any applicable state unitary,
combined or similar) income Tax Return. The Tax Package shall be completed in
accordance with past practice, including past practice as to providing such
information and as to the method of computation of separate taxable income or
other relevant measure of income of the Acquired Companies.   Section 6.5
Use of Name. Seller Parties agree that promptly following the Closing Date,
Seller and its Affiliates shall, except to the extent provided in the license
agreement to be entered into pursuant to Section 2.11, cease and desist, and

names "Budget" or "Ryder" and any variation or derivation thereof and
any trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress,
logos, business and product names, slogans and registrations and applications
for registration thereof (the "Marks and Logos") and will (i) adopt new Marks
and Logos which are not confusingly similar to the Marks and Logos, (ii)
file amendments to the certificate or articles of incorporation, as the case
may be, of Seller with the Delaware Secretary of State (or other
appropriate Governmental Body) and shall make appropriate filings with any
other applicable registry(ies) changing Seller\'s and its Subsidiaries\'
corporate names and any d/b/a\'s to names that do not include any of the
Marks and Logos or words confusingly similar thereto and (iii) neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make any further use of the Marks and
Logos.   86   Section 6.6 Remittance of Funds.   (a) Any interest,
commissions, fees and other payments, including without limitation, payments
in respect of principal and interest, received by Seller Parties or any
Affiliate thereof relating to the Acquired Business after the Closing Date in
any capacity, whether accrued prior to or on the Closing Date, including with
respect to any TFFC MV Lease, franchise or other Contract included in the
Acquired Business, shall as of the Closing Date be for the account of Buyer.
Any such amounts received by Seller Parties and their Affiliates after the
Closing Date shall be received by Seller Parties and their Affiliates in
trust for Buyer and Seller Parties will, and will cause their Affiliates to,
subject to the consummation of the Closing, immediately pay such amounts to
an accounted designated by Buyer upon receipt thereof.   (b) Any interest,
commissions, fees and other payments, including payments in respect of
principal and interest, received by Buyer in any capacity in respect of any
Excluded Asset or Retained Business (whether because the Closing has not yet
occurred or otherwise) shall be received by Buyer in trust for Seller Parties
and Buyer will immediately pay such amounts to an account designated by
Seller upon receipt thereof.   Section 6.7 Mail Received After the Closing.
Following the Closing, Buyer may receive and open all mail addressed to
Seller or any of its Affiliates and deal with the contents thereof in its
reasonable discretion to the extent that such mail and the contents thereof
relate to the Acquired Business, the Acquired Assets or any of the Assumed
Liabilities. Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller, at
Seller\'s expense, all mail received by Buyer after the Closing addressed to
any Seller Entity which does not relate to the Acquired Business, the
Acquired Assets or the Assumed Liabilities until the earlier of (i) one year
after the Closing and (ii) the entry of a final order in the Chapter 11
Cases.   Section 6.8 Further Assurances.   (a) At any time and from time
to time after Seller Parties shall execute and deliver to Buyer such
instruments of transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, in addition
to those executed and delivered by Seller Parties at Closing, and take such
action as Buyer may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order to more
effectively transfer, convey and assign to Buyer and to confirm Buyer\'s
title to all of the Acquired Assets, to put Buyer in actual possession and
operating control thereof and to permit Buyer to exercise all rights with
respect thereto and otherwise to give full effect to the provisions of this
Agreement.   (b) If, notwithstanding the 363 Order and the 365 Order,
any transfer or assignment by Seller Parties to, or any assumption by Buyer
of, any interest in, or liability, obligation or commitment under, any
Acquired Asset requires a Governmental Consent or a Third Party Consent and
any such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing and Buyer, in its sole
discretion, waives the condition set forth in Section 7.2(d) with respect to
such Governmental Consent or Third Party Consent, then, if Buyer so elects,
such Acquired Asset shall not be transferred to Buyer at the Closing Date and
Seller Parties shall cooperate (at their own expense) in any lawful and
reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer under which Buyer shall
obtain the economic benefits under the asset, claim or right with respect to
which the consent has not been obtained. Such reasonable arrangement may
include (i) the   87  subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer
of any and all rights of Seller Parties against the other party to such

set forth below of an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the "Termination
Amount"):   (i) upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections

(i) notwithstanding the foregoing if Buyer  terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(a), Buyer\'s recovery  shall be limited to 23.34% of
the Termination Amount (i.e., $3,500,000)  if and only if (A) the breaches of
representations and warranties by  Seller Parties giving rise to such
termination do not, individually or  in the aggregate with all other breaches
of representations and  warranties by Seller Parties under this Agreement,
constitute or have a  Material Adverse Effect, (B) the representations or
warranties of  Seller Parties whose breach gives rise to the termination were
true and  correct (to the extent that the condition set forth in Section
7.2(a)  was satisfied on the date of this Agreement) when first given or
made,  (C) such representations and warranties of Seller Parties have
become  untrue or incorrect (to the extent Buyer has a termination right
under  Section 8.3(a)) solely as a result of an event(s) or occurrence(s) 
which was and is outside the control of, and which was not and is not  caused
by or remediable by, any of Seller Parties or their Affiliates  and (D)
Seller Parties have not breached any of their covenants in any  material
respect; (ii) if Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant to  Section 8.3(b),
Buyer\'s recovery shall be limited to 23.34% of the  Termination Amount
(i.e., $3,500,000) if but only if the breaches  giving rise to such
termination do not, individually   94   or in the aggregate with all other
breaches by Seller Parties under  this Agreement, constitute or have (A) a
Material Adverse Effect, (B) a  material adverse effect on the value to Buyer
of the Acquired Business  or the Acquired Assets or of the transactions
contemplated hereby or  (C) a material adverse effect on consummation of the
transactions  contemplated hereby on a timely basis; and (iii) if this
Agreement is  terminated pursuant to Section 8.3(d)(ii) or Section 8.3(g),

(A)  six months after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 
8.3(d)(ii) or (B) one year after the termination of this Agreement  pursuant
to Section 8.3(g), in which case the remaining 76.66% (i.e.,  $11,500,000)
shall be due on the date of closing of such Alternative  Transaction, without
any need of written demand therefor by Buyer; and   (ii) upon termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Sections  8.2(a) (if any of Seller Parties is the
terminating party), 8.3(c),  8.3(e), 8.3(f), 8.3(h), 8.3(j), 8.3(k) or 8.3(l)
Seller Parties shall  pay to Buyer 23.34% of the Termination Amount (i.e.,
$3,500,000) within  two Business Days of such termination; provided, however,
that if Buyer  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(e), Buyer
shall not  be entitled to any portion of the Termination Amount if by October
23,  2002 Seller Parties shall have notified Buyer in writing of their 
desire to extend the October 28, 2002 deadline set forth in Section  8.3(e)
to and including November 28, 2002 and Buyer terminates this  Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(e) prior to November 28, 2002;  provided, further,
that if (A) Buyer terminates this Agreement pursuant  to Section 8.3(e), and
(B) any of Seller Parties obtains approval of  Bankruptcy Court for an
Alternative Transaction within 275 days of the  termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(e) and (C) a  proposal for the Alternative
Transaction so approved was in existence  prior to such termination, then
Seller Parties shall pay to Buyer an  additional amount in cash equal to
76.66% of the Termination Amount  (i.e., $11,500,000) on the date of closing
of such Alternative  Transaction, without need of any written demand therefor
by Buyer.   For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of this Sections 8.6(b),
the closing of an Alternative Transaction shall be deemed to occur on the
earliest of (i) the date any payment in respect thereof or relating thereto
is made, (ii) the date on which any asset or property is transferred,
conveyed, assigned or leased pursuant thereto, (iii) the date on which any
Equity Securities are issued pursuant thereto and (iv) the date of
substantial consummation of any plan of reorganization or liquidation.   
(c) No portion of the Termination Amount shall be payable to Buyer if (i)
this Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to Sections 8.1 or (B) because the
necessary approvals under the applicable Competition Law relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
have been denied and (ii) no event has occurred (or failed to occur) which
has or could at the time of the termination described in clause (B) above,
form the basis for termination of this Agreement by Buyer under any other
provision of this Agreement.   (d) If Buyer terminates or is entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to more than one Section of this Agreement,
Buyer shall be entitled to receive from Seller Parties   95  an amount
equal to the highest percentage of the Termination Amount prescribed by all
such Sections.   (e) The obligations of Seller Parties to pay the
Termination Amount as provided herein shall be, pursuant to section 364(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code, entitled to administrative expense status with priority
over any and all administrative expenses of the kind specified in sections
503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code in each of the Chapter 11 Cases and
senior to all other superpriority administrative expenses in such cases,
except any superpriority administrative expenses granted pursuant to the
interim orders of the Bankruptcy Court dated August 5, 2002 or to be granted
pursuant to Final Orders of the Bankruptcy Court, authorizing and approving
the DIP Financing and the DIP L/C Rollover.   (f) Seller Parties agree and
acknowledge that Buyer\'s due diligence, efforts, negotiation and execution
of this Agreement have involved substantial investment of management time and
have required significant commitment of financial, legal and other resources
by Buyer and its Affiliates and that such due diligence, efforts, negotiation
and execution have provided value to Seller Parties.   ARTICLE 9

party\'s right to appeal any order of the Bankruptcy Court, (a) the
Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this
