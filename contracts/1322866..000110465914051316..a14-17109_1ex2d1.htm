 **WHEREAS,** for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended
that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code, and this Agreement is
intended to be, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

      
 

 



 

 **WHEREAS,** Acquiror, Acquiror Canadian Sub and Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties and covenants in connection with, and to

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound, Acquiror, Acquiror Canadian Sub
and Company agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE ARRANGEMENT**

 



 

Section 1.1. _ Arrangement_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time and as more fully set forth in
the Plan of Arrangement:

 



 

(a) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time held by a shareholder of the Company that has validly exercised
its Dissent Right in respect of the Arrangement will be transferred by such
shareholder to Acquiror Canadian Sub.

 



 

(b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Company Common Shares owned, directly or
indirectly, by Acquiror, Acquiror Canadian Sub and other than Company Common
Shares with respect to which Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement have
been properly exercised and not withdrawn) will be transferred by such
shareholder to Acquiror Canadian Sub in exchange for the Consideration.

 



 

(c) Each outstanding Company Stock Option, each outstanding restricted stock
unit that is measured in relation to, or settleable in, Company Common Shares
(a " _Company RSU_ ") and each award of restricted stock relating to Company
Common Shares (a " _Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") (each such Company
Stock Option, Company RSU and Company Restricted Stock Award, a " _Company
Compensatory Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by
Acquiror and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an option,
restricted stock unit or restricted stock award, as the case may be,
denominated in shares of Acquiror Common Stock based on the Share Exchange
Ratio and subject to terms and conditions substantially identical to those in
effect at the Effective Time (each such assumed Company Compensatory Award, an
" _Assumed Company Award_ "), except that (i) the number of shares of Acquiror
Common Stock that will be subject to each such Assumed Company Award shall be
determined by multiplying the number of Company Common Shares subject to such
Assumed Company Award by the Share Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) and (ii) if applicable, the exercise or purchase price per share
of each such Assumed Company Award shall equal (A) the per share exercise or
purchase price of each such Assumed Company Award divided by (B) the Share
Exchange Ratio (rounded upwards to the nearest whole cent). At the Effective
Time, Acquiror shall assume the Company Stock Plan.

 



 

Section 1.2. _Company Implementation Steps._

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of the SEC Clearance,
Company shall apply, in a manner reasonably acceptable to Acquiror, to the
Court under 291 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the "
_BCBCA_ ") and, in cooperation with

 



      
 

 



 

Acquiror, prepare, file and diligently pursue an application, for the Interim
Order, which shall provide (among other things):

 



 

(i) for the class of persons to whom notice shall be provided in respect of
the proposed arrangement under Section 288 of the BCBCA on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Plan of Arrangement (the "
_Arrangement_ ") and the Company Meeting and for the manner in which such
notice shall be provided;

 



 

(ii) that the requisite approval (the " _Company Requisite Shareholder Vote_
") for the Arrangement Resolution shall be:

 



 

(A) at least two-thirds of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by
those holders of Company Common Shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the Company Meeting, each Company Common Share entitling the holder
thereof to one vote on the Arrangement Resolution; and

 



 

(B) at least two-thirds of the votes cast on the Arrangement Resolution by
those holders of Company Common Shares and holders of Company RSUs, Option
Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards present in person or represented by
proxy at the Company Meeting together voting as a class, each Company Common
Share entitling the holder thereof to one vote on the Arrangement Resolution
and each Company RSU, Option Award and Company Restricted Stock Award
entitling the holder thereof to that number of votes equal to the number of
Company Common Shares issuable upon the valid exercise of a Company Stock
Option, or the valid settlement of a Company RSU or Company Restricted Stock
Award, as applicable, on the Arrangement Resolution;

 



 

(iii) that, in all other respects, the terms, restrictions and conditions of
Companys articles of continuation and by-laws as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement, including quorum requirements and all other matters, shall
apply in respect of the Company Meeting;

 



 

(iv) for the grant of the Dissent Rights in respect of the Arrangement;

 



 

(v) for the notice requirements with respect to the presentation of the
application to the Court for the Final Order;

 



 

(vi) that the Company Meeting may be adjourned or postponed from time to time
by Company (subject to the terms of this Agreement) without the need for
additional approval of the Court;

 



 

(vii) confirmation of the record date for the purposes of determining the
holders of Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs and
Company Restricted Stock Awards, entitled to receive material and vote at the
Company Meeting in accordance with the Interim Order;

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) that the Plan of Arrangement may be amended by the Parties, after the
Interim Order, without the need for additional approval of the Court, to
reflect any comments received by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ "), if any;

 



 

(ix) that it is Acquirors intention to rely upon the exemption from
registration provided by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act with
respect to the issuance of the Acquiror Common Stock, options, restricted
stock units and restricted stock awards of Acquiror (collectively, the "
_Acquiror Issued Securities_ ") to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement,
based on the Courts approval of the Arrangement; and

 



 

(x) that it is Acquirors intention to rely on the prospectus and registration
requirements of applicable Canadian Securities Laws either by virtue of
exemptive relief from the Canadian Securities Authorities or by virtue of
applicable exemptions under Canadian Securities Laws with respect to the
issuance of the Acquiror Issued Securities pursuant to the Arrangement.

 



 

(b) Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the SEC has
informed Acquiror and Company that it has no further comments with respect to
or will not review (" _SEC Clearance_ ") the Proxy Statement / Circular and
consistent with the provisions set forth in _Section 4.7_, duly take all
lawful action to call, give written notice of, convene and hold a meeting of
its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") for the purpose of voting upon
the approval of (i) the Continuance Resolution by the holders of Company
Common Shares and (ii) the Arrangement Resolution by (A) the holders of
Company Common Shares and (B) the holders of Company Common Shares and the
Company RSUs, Option Awards and Company Restricted Stock Awards, voting
together as a class.

 



 

(c) If (i) the Interim Order is obtained, (ii) the Continuance Resolution is
approved at the Company Meeting in accordance with the YBCA and (iii) the
Arrangement Resolution is approved at the Company Meeting as provided for in
the Interim Order, then Company shall, as reasonably practicable thereafter,
and no later than one Business Day thereafter, complete the Company
Continuance.

 



 

(d) Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the completion of
the Company Continuance and no later than two Business Days thereafter,
complete all actions necessary or desirable to submit the Arrangement to the
Court and diligently pursue an application for the Final Order pursuant to
Section 291 of the BCBCA.

 



 

(e) After obtaining the Final Order and subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article 5_ (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions), Company shall, one Business Day prior to the
Effective Date, send an amalgamation application in respect of the Arrangement
(the " _Amalgamation Application_ "), together with such other documents as
may be required in connection therewith under the BCBCA, to the Registrar
appointed pursuant to Section 400 of the BCBCA (the " _Registrar_ "), for
endorsement and filing by the Registrar to give effect to the amalgamation and
the conversion of Amalco to an unlimited liability company which form part

 



      
 

 



 

of the Arrangement. The Amalgamation Application and all such other documents
shall be in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror.

 



 

Section 1.3. _Acquiror Implementation Steps._ Acquiror shall, as soon as
reasonably practicable after SEC Clearance and consistent with the provisions
set forth in _Section 4.7_, duly take all lawful action to call, give written
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Acquiror
Meeting_ ") for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the Stock Issuance
by the holders of Acquiror Common Stock.

 



 

Section 1.4. _Certain Adjustments._ If, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, (a) the outstanding Company Common Shares or Acquiror
Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged
for a different number of shares or different class, in each case, by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, combination
or exchange of shares, (b) a stock dividend or dividend payable in any other
securities of Company or Acquiror shall be declared with a record date within
such period or (c) any similar event shall have occurred, then the Share
Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of
Company Common Shares the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event.

 



 

Section 1.5. _Dissenting Shares._ Prior to the Company Meeting, Company shall
provide Acquiror with prompt (and in no event later than two Business Days
after receipt of notice) written notice of any purported exercise or
withdrawal of Dissent Rights by any shareholder of Company that is received by
Company in relation to the Continuance Resolution, the Arrangement Resolution
or both. Subject to applicable Law, Company shall provide Acquiror with the
opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any exercise of such Dissent Rights. Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, settle or offer to settle, or otherwise negotiate,
any exercise of such Dissent Rights without the prior written consent of
Acquiror.

 



 

Section 1.6. _Amendments to Plan of Arrangement._ Subject to the Interim
Order, the Final Order, Section 6.3, Article 6 of the Plan of Arrangement and
any applicable Law, Company agrees to amend the Plan of Arrangement at any
time prior to the Effective Time to add, remove or amend any steps or terms as
determined to be reasonably necessary or desirable by Acquiror, provided that
the Plan of Arrangement shall not be amended in any manner that is (a)
prejudicial to the holders of Company Common Shares or is inconsistent with
the provisions of this Agreement or (b) creates a reasonable risk of
materially delaying, impairing or impeding in any material respect the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
receipt of any approval under any Regulatory Law or the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in _Article 5_.

 



 

Section 1.7. _Closing._ Subject to satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article 5_, the Arrangement shall be effective at
the Effective Time on the Closing Date and will have all of the effects
provided by applicable Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.8. _U.S. Securities Act Matters._ The Parties agree that the
Arrangement will be carried out with the intention that all Acquiror Issued
Securities issued on completion of the Arrangement will be issued by Acquiror
in reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereunder. In order to ensure the
availability of the exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities
Act, the Parties agree that the Arrangement will be carried out on the
following basis:

 



 

(a) the Arrangement will be subject to the approval of the Court;

 



 

(b) the Court will be advised as to the intention of the Parties to rely on
the exemption under Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act prior to the
hearing required to approve the Arrangement;

 



 

(c) the Court will be required to satisfy itself as to the fairness of the
Arrangement to the holders of Company Common Shares, Option Awards, Company
RSUs and Company Restricted Stock Awards of Company (the " _Company Issued
Securities_ "), subject to the Arrangement;

 



 

(d) Company will ensure that holders of Company Issued Securities entitled to
receive Acquiror Issued Securities on completion of the Arrangement will be
given adequate notice advising them of their right to attend the hearing of
the Court to give approval of the Arrangement and providing them with
sufficient information necessary for them to exercise that right;

 



 

(e) the holders of Company Issued Securities entitled to receive Acquiror
Issued Securities will be advised that the Acquiror Issued Securities issued
pursuant to the Arrangement have not been registered under the U.S. Securities
Act and will be issued by Acquiror in reliance on the exemption under Section
3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act;

 



 

(f) the Final Order approving the Arrangement that is obtained from the Court
will expressly state that the Arrangement is approved by the Court as being
fair to the holders of Company Issued Securities;

 



 

(g) the Interim Order approving the Company Meeting will specify that each
holder of Company Issued Securities will have the right to appear before the
Court at the hearing of the Court to give approval of the Arrangement so long
as they enter an appearance within a reasonable time;

 



 

(h) the Final Order shall include a statement to substantially the following
effect:

 



 

"This Order will serve as a basis of a claim to an exemption, pursuant to
Section 3(a)(10) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, from
the registration requirements otherwise imposed by that act, regarding the
distribution of securities of Acquiror, pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement."

 



      
 

 



 

Section 1.9. _Canadian Securities Laws Matters._ The Parties agree that the
Arrangement will be carried out with the intention that all Acquiror Issued
Securities issued on completion of the Arrangement will be issued by Acquiror
in reliance of the prospectus and registration requirements of applicable
Canadian Securities Laws either by virtue of exemptive relief from the
Canadian Securities Authorities or by virtue of applicable exemptions under
Canadian Securities Laws.

 



 

Section 1.10. _United States Tax Treatment._ It is intended by the Parties
that (a) the transactions included in the Merger shall be treated as a single
integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (b) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.
Except as otherwise required by a final "determination" (within the meaning of
Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code), in any Tax filing or proceeding the parties
shall not take any position inconsistent with the intended U.S. federal income
tax treatment of the Merger that is described in the immediately preceding
sentence (the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ ").

 



 

 **ARTICLE 2 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY**

 



 

Except (a) as set forth in the disclosure schedules (with specific reference
to the section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information stated
in such disclosure relates; provided that any fact or condition disclosed in
any section of such disclosure schedules in such a way as to make its
relevance to a representation or representations made elsewhere in this
Agreement or information called for by another section of such disclosure
letter reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such
representation or representations or to be disclosed on such other section of
such disclosure letter notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto) delivered by the Company to Acquiror prior to the execution
of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), or (b) as disclosed
in Company SEC Reports filed or furnished by the Company after January 1, 2014
and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, but excluding, in
each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factor section or in any
other section to the extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary,
predictive or forward-looking in nature; provided, that the exception provided
for in this _clause (b)_ shall be applied if, and only if, the relevance of
the applicable disclosure in any such Company SEC Report filed prior to the
date hereof to a particular representation is reasonably apparent on the face
of the text of such disclosure, Company represents and warrants to Acquiror

jurisdiction wherein the character of the properties owned or leased by it, or
the nature of its business, makes such licensing or qualification necessary,

Company

 



      
 

 



 

has, prior to the date hereof, made available to Acquiror complete and correct
copies of the articles of continuation and by-laws of Company, including any
amendments thereto, as presently in effect.

(a) The execution and delivery by Company of this Agreement do not, and the

Section 2.6. _Filings with the SEC; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed
Liabilities; Sarbanes-Oxley Act._

 



 

(a) Company has filed or furnished all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC (the " _Company SEC Reports_ ") and
all other applicable securities regulatory authorities and self-regulatory
organizations since January 1, 2011 (collectively, including the Company SEC
Reports and all exhibits thereto, the " _Company Securities Reports_ "). None
of the Company Securities Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. All of the Company Securities Reports, as of their
respective dates (or, as of the date of any amendment to the respective
Company Securities Report), complied, as to form, in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the U.S. Securities Laws and the Canadian
Securities Laws. No Subsidiary of Company is required to file any registration
statement, prospectus, report, schedule, form, statement or other document
with any applicable securities regulatory authority and self-regulatory
organization, including the SEC.

 



 

(b) Each of the financial statements of Company included in the Company
Securities Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date of any
amendment to the respective Company Securities Report), (i) complied, as to
form, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the applicable U.S. Securities
Laws with respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ")
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure)

 



      
 

 



 

applied on a consistent basis during the periods and the dates involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and (iii) fairly present, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position and consolidated
results of operations and cash flows of Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates or for the respective periods set
forth therein.

 



 

(c) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations required to be reflected or reserved, in accordance with GAAP, on
a consolidated balance sheet of Company (including the notes thereto), except
liabilities (i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved on the Company
Recent Balance Sheet, (ii) incurred after the date of the Company Recent
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business, (iii) as a result of the
execution of this Agreement (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Company; or (v) that have been discharged or paid in full.

 



 

(d) Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by Company in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to the management of
Company as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure
and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "). The management of Company has
completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2013,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. The
management of Company has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
its system of internal control over financial reporting prior to the date of
this Agreement, to Companys outside auditors and the audit committee of the
Board of Directors of Company (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any material respect Companys
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Companys internal control over
financial reporting.

 



 

(e) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters of
any Securities Authority or self-regulatory organization received by Company
relating to the Company Securities Reports. The Company has heretofore made
available to Acquiror true, correct and complete copies of all written
correspondence between Company and any Securities Authority occurring since
January 1, 2011. None of the Company Securities Reports is, to the knowledge
of Company, the subject of ongoing Securities Authority review.

 



 

(f) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among

 



      
 

 



 

the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose or
limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where
the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in the Companys financial statements or other Company
Securities Reports.

 



 

Section 2.7. _Tax Matters._

 



 

(a) All Taxes of Company and its Subsidiaries attributable to periods
preceding or ending with the date of the Company Recent Balance Sheet have
been paid or are being contested in good faith through appropriate proceedings
and adequate accruals, reserves or provisions have been made in the Company
Recent Balance Sheet. Since the date of the Company Recent Balance Sheet,
neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any Taxes other than
Taxes incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent in type and
amount with past practices of Company or such Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed, and all such Tax Returns were and are correct and
complete, except for failures to so file or failures to be so correct and
complete that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Company has delivered
to Acquiror true and complete copies of corporate income Tax Returns filed by
Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or after December 31,
2010.

 



 

(c) Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has duly withheld, collected and
timely paid all Taxes that it was required to withhold, collect and pay
relating to amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, shareholder or other Person, except for failures to withhold,

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

 



 

(d) No claim has been made by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where
Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that such entity
is or may be subject to Tax or required to file a Tax Return in such
jurisdiction, except for those instances where neither the imposition of any
such Tax nor the filing of any such Tax Return (and the obligation to pay the
Taxes reflected thereon), individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Since
January 1, 2004, Company is not, and has never been, engaged in the conduct of
a "trade or business within the United States" within the meaning of Section
882 of the Code. There are no outstanding waivers or comparable consents that
have been given by Company or any of its Subsidiaries regarding the
application of the statute of limitations with respect to any Taxes or Tax
Returns, other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Liens
for Taxes, other than Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.

(iii) any notice indicating an intent to commence an audit.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) Since January 1, 2009, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
requested or received a Tax ruling, private letter ruling, technical advice
memorandum, advance pricing agreement, competent authority relief or similar
agreement, or has entered into a closing agreement or contract with any taxing
authority that, in each case, remains outstanding or effective. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to a Tax sharing, allocation,
indemnification or similar Contract (except such Contracts as are solely
between Company and its Subsidiaries) pursuant to which it could have an
obligation to make a payment to any Person in respect of Taxes. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any gain recognition
agreement under Section 367 of the Code.

 



 

(g) Company is not and has never been a "United States person" within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code. At no time has any Subsidiary of
Company been a member of an affiliated group of corporations that filed a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any person other than Company
and its Subsidiaries, whether such liability arises under Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 or under any comparable provision of state, local, or foreign law, or
arises by contract, or as a transferee or successor, or otherwise.

 



 

(h) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is participating or has
participated in a reportable transaction within the meaning of Treas. Reg. §
1.6011-4 or Section 6707A(c) of the Code. Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have disclosed on their U.S. federal income Tax Returns all positions taken
therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement of U.S. federal
income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code. Neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received a Tax opinion with respect to any
transaction relating to Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than a
transaction in the ordinary course of business. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is the direct or indirect beneficiary of a guarantee of Tax
benefits or any other arrangement that has the same economic effect with
respect to any transaction or Tax opinion relating to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(i) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) been the "distributing

of the Code) with respect to a transaction that was purported to be governed
in whole or in part by Section 355 of the Code, (ii) participated in an
international boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of the Code, or (iii)
made or revoked any election under Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-3 regarding
classification as a corporation, as a partnership, or as a disregarded entity.

 



 

(j) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a Tax period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law); (ii)

conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice in all material respects, (b) there has not been any
change, event, development, condition, occurrence or combination of changes,
events, developments, conditions or occurrences that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company and (c) there has not been any action taken by Company or
any of its Subsidiaries that would have required the consent of Acquiror under
Section 4.2(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (x), (xi), (xii),
(xiii), (xv) or (xviii) (to the extent subclause 4.2(b)(xviii) relates to the
foregoing subclauses) if such action was taken after the date of this
Agreement.

arbitration, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened against

authorizations and consents of all Governmental Entities that are necessary
for the operation of their respective businesses as now being conducted
(collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "), and no suspension or cancellation
of any of the Company Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of Company,
threatened. Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of
Company Permits, except for instances of noncompliance where neither the costs

(a) Company and its Subsidiaries, and their respective assets, are in
compliance with all Laws and Orders, except for instances of noncompliance

exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501 of the Code by the
Internal Revenue Service, or such plan is a prototype plan entitled to rely on
a currently effective opinion letter. Each such Company Employee Benefit Plan
has been timely amended since the date of the latest favorable determination

to any Person the right to elect, or to designate or nominate for election, a
director to the Board of Directors of Acquiror or a director of the board of
directors or similar supervisory body of any Subsidiary of Acquiror. There are

Section 3.5. _No Violation._

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery by each of Acquiror and Acquiror Canadian Sub
of this Agreement do not, and the performance by each of Acquiror and Acquiror
Canadian Sub of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation of, or constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of

the properties, assets or business of, Acquiror, Acquiror Canadian Sub or any
of Acquirors other Subsidiaries, except, in the case of this _subclause
(iii)_, as individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. The execution and delivery by
each of Acquiror and Acquiror Canadian Sub of this Agreement do not, and the
performance by each of Acquiror and Acquiror Canadian Sub of this Agreement
will not, result in the creation of any Share Encumbrance upon any Equity
Interests of Acquiror, Acquiror Canadian Sub or any of Acquirors other
Subsidiaries or any Lien upon any of the material properties or assets of
Acquiror, Acquiror Canadian Sub or any of Acquirors other Subsidiaries

consent, approval or

 



      
 

 



 

authorization would not prevent or materially delay the performance by each of
Acquiror and Acquiror Canadian Sub of its obligations under this Agreement or
(B) in connection with any submission described in _subclauses (i)_, _(ii)_
and _(iii)_ above.

 



 

Section 3.6. _Filings with the SEC; Financial Statements; No Undisclosed
Liabilities; Sarbanes-Oxley Act._

 



 

(a) Acquiror has filed or furnished all required registration statements,
prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC (the " _Acquiror SEC Reports_ ") and
all other applicable securities regulatory authorities and self-regulatory
organizations since January 1, 2011 (collectively, including the Acquiror SEC
Reports and all exhibits thereto, the " _Acquiror Securities Reports_ "). None
of the Acquiror Securities Reports, as of their respective dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on
the date of such filing), contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. All of the Acquiror Securities Reports, as of their
respective dates (or, as of the date of any amendment to the respective
Acquiror Securities Report), complied, as to form, in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the U.S. Securities Laws and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. No Subsidiary of
Acquiror is required to file any registration statement, prospectus, report,
schedule, form, statement or other document with any applicable securities
regulatory authority and self-regulatory organization, including the SEC.

 



 

(b) Each of the financial statements of Acquiror included in the Acquiror
Securities Reports, as of their respective dates (and as of the date of any
amendment to the respective Acquiror Securities Report), (i) complied, as to
form, in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and
with the published rules and regulations of the applicable U.S. Securities
Laws with respect thereto, (ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end audit
adjustments and the absence of footnote disclosure) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods and the dates involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and (iii) fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and
cash flows of Acquiror and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates or for the respective periods set forth therein.

 



 

(c) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations required to be reflected or reserved, in accordance with GAAP, on
a consolidated balance sheet of Acquiror (including the notes thereto), except
liabilities (i) as and to the extent reflected or reserved on the Acquiror
Recent Balance Sheet, (ii) incurred after the date of the Acquiror Recent
Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business, (iii) as a result of the
execution of this Agreement (iv) that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not, or would not reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Acquiror; or (v) that have been discharged or paid in full.

 



 

(d) Acquiror has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 under the

 



      
 

 



 

Exchange Act. Acquirors disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
Acquiror in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act are recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such material information is
accumulated and communicated to the management of Acquiror as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. The management of Acquiror has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of Acquirors internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. The management of Acquiror has disclosed, based on
its most recent evaluation of its system of internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to Acquirors outside auditors
and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Acquiror (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any
material respect Acquirors ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
Acquirors internal control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters of
any Securities Authority or self-regulatory organization received by Acquiror
relating to the Acquiror Securities Reports. Acquiror has heretofore made
available to Company true, correct and complete copies of all written
correspondence between Acquiror and any Securities Authority occurring since
January 1, 2011. None of the Acquiror Securities Reports is, to the knowledge
of Acquiror, the subject of ongoing Securities Authority review.

 



 

(f) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Acquiror or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries in Acquirors
financial statements or other Acquiror Securities Reports.

 



 

Section 3.7. _Tax Matters._

 



 

(a) All Taxes of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries attributable to periods
preceding or ending with the date of the Acquiror Recent Balance Sheet have
been paid or have been included in a liability accrual for the specific Taxes
on the Acquiror Recent Balance Sheet. Since the date of the Acquiror Recent
Balance Sheet, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any
Taxes other than Taxes incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
in type and amount with past practices of Acquiror or such Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) Each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has timely filed all Tax Returns
required to be filed, and all such Tax Returns were and are correct and
complete, except for failures to so file

 



      
 

 



 

or failures to be so correct and complete that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Acquiror. Acquiror has delivered to Company true and complete copies of
corporate income Tax Returns filed by Acquiror and its Subsidiaries for Tax
periods ending on or after December 31, 2010.

 



 

(c) Each of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries has duly withheld, collected and
timely paid all Taxes that it was required to withhold, collect and pay
relating to amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, shareholder or other Person, except for failures to withhold,
collect or pay that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror.

 



 

(d) No claim has been made by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that such entity
is or may be subject to Tax or required to file a Tax Return in such
jurisdiction, except for those instances where neither the imposition of any
such Tax nor the filing of any such Tax Return (and the obligation to pay the
Taxes reflected thereon), individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. There
are no outstanding waivers or comparable consents that have been given by
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries regarding the application of the statute
of limitations with respect to any Taxes or Tax Returns, other than in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. Neither Acquiror
nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any Liens for Taxes, other than
Liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable.

 



 

(e) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has received from any Tax
authority with respect to Tax periods ending on or after December 31, 2007:
(i) any notice of underpayment of Taxes or other deficiency, or notice of
proposed adjustment; (ii) any request for information relating to Taxes; or
(iii) any notice indicating an intent to commence an audit.

 



 

(f) Since January 1, 2009, neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has
requested or received a Tax ruling, private letter ruling, technical advice
memorandum, advance pricing agreement, competent authority relief or similar
agreement, or has entered into a closing agreement or contract with any taxing
authority that, in each case, remains outstanding or effective. Neither
Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to a Tax sharing, allocation,
indemnification or similar Contract (except such Contracts as are solely
between Acquiror and its Subsidiaries) pursuant to which it could have an
obligation to make a payment to any Person in respect of Taxes. Neither
Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any gain recognition
agreement under Section 367 of the Code.

 



 

(g) At no time has Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror been a member of an
affiliated group of corporations that filed a consolidated U.S. federal income
tax return, other than a group the common parent of which at such time was
Acquiror or a Subsidiary of Acquiror. No affiliated group of corporations of
which Acquiror or any Subsidiary of Acquiror has been a member has
discontinued filing consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns during the
three years preceding the Closing Date. Neither Acquiror nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any person other than Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries, whether such liability arises under Treas. Reg. §
1.1502-6 or under any comparable provision of state, local, or foreign law, or
arises by contract, or as a transferee or successor, or otherwise.

 



       
 

 



 

(h) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries is participating or has
participated in a reportable or listed transaction within the meaning of
Treas. Reg. §1.6011-4 or Section 6707A(c) of the Code. Acquiror and each of
its Subsidiaries have disclosed on their U.S. federal income Tax Returns all
positions taken therein that could give rise to a substantial understatement
of U.S. federal income Tax within the meaning of Section 6662 of the Code.
Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has received a Tax opinion with
respect to any transaction relating to Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
other than a transaction in the ordinary course of business. Neither Acquiror
nor any of its Subsidiaries is the direct or indirect beneficiary of a
guarantee of Tax benefits or any other arrangement that has the same economic
effect with respect to any transaction or Tax opinion relating to Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(i) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries has (i) been the
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning
of Section 355 of the Code) with respect to a transaction that was purported
to be governed in whole or in part by Section 355 of the Code, (ii)
participated in an international boycott within the meaning of Section 999 of
the Code, or (iii) made or revoked any election under Treas. Reg. § 301.7701-3
regarding classification as a corporation, as a partnership, or as a
disregarded entity.

 



 

(j) Neither Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to include
any item of income in, or exclude any item of deduction from, taxable income
for any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a
result of any: (i) change in method of accounting for a Tax period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law); (ii)
"closing agreement" as described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law)
executed on or prior to the Closing Date; (iii) installment sale or "open

through the date of this Agreement, (a) Acquiror and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice in all material respects, (b) there has not been any
change, event, development, condition, occurrence or combination of changes,
events, developments, conditions or occurrences that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror and (c) there has not been any action taken by Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries that would have required the consent of Company under
_Section 4.3(b)(i)_, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ , _(v)_ , _(vi)_ or _(ix)_ (to the
extent subclause 4.3(b)(ix) relates to the foregoing subclauses) if such
action was taken after the date of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 3.9. _Litigation; Orders._ There is no claim, action, suit,
arbitration, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether civil, criminal or
administrative, pending or, to the knowledge of Acquiror, threatened against
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers or
directors (in such capacity) or any of their respective businesses or assets,
at law or in equity, before or by any Governmental Entity or arbitrator,
except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Acquiror. None of Acquiror, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective businesses or assets

the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Acquiror.

 



 

Section 3.10. _Compliance with Laws._

 



 

(a) Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, and their respective assets, are in
compliance with all Laws and Orders, except for instances of noncompliance
where neither the costs to comply nor the failure to comply, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Acquiror.

 



 

(b) To the knowledge of Acquiror, none of Acquiror, any of its Subsidiaries or
any director, officer, employee, agent or other person associated with or
acting on behalf of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries is an official, agent

materials received by such Party and its Affiliates from any Governmental
Entity in respect of such filings, applications or such transactions and (iii)
cooperate with the other Party in connection with such filings and
applications (including, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, permitting
each Party to review all such documents of the other Party prior to filing and
consulting with the other Party with respect to the content thereof) and in
connection with resolving any investigation or other inquiry of any
Governmental Entity under all such Regulatory Laws, including in connection
with contesting any adverse determination made by a Governmental Entity under
any such Regulatory Law if such adverse determination is reasonably likely to
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) In connection with this _Section 4.5_, each Party shall promptly inform
the other Party of any material communication received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity in connection with any filing
or application with, submission to or investigation or inquiry by any
Governmental Entity under any applicable Regulatory Law. No Party shall
independently participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any such filing, submission, investigation or inquiry without
providing the other Party with reasonable prior notice of the meeting and, to
the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend
and/or participate. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties shall consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals relating
to any such filing, application, submission, investigation or inquiry made or
submitted by or on behalf of either Party. No Party shall be required to share
information related to its valuation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Either Party may, as it deems advisable, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other Party under this
_Section 4.5_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and shall not be disclosed by such outside counsel to directors,
officers, employees or other agents of the recipient, unless express prior
written permission is obtained from the source of the materials.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither
Acquiror nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to grant a license in
respect of, or to dispose or hold separate, or to agree to or to consent to
any request to grant a license, dispose of, hold separate or restrict its
ownership and operation of, all or any portion of the business or assets of
Acquiror

 



      
 

 



 

and its Subsidiaries, including, for this purpose, Company and its
Subsidiaries, for any reason or purpose that would be reasonably likely to
individually or in the aggregate have a material and negative effect on the
business, operations or assets of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries or Company and
its Subsidiaries or Acquirors anticipated benefits from the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. With regard to this _Section 4.5_, Acquiror
shall have the right to take (or decline to take) any steps or actions
Acquiror chooses to minimize the extent or effect of any relief that may be
sought in relation to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and
Company and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate with and assist Acquirer with
regard to the foregoing.

 



 

Section 4.6. _Proxy Statement / Circular._

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement, (i)

after obtaining the Interim Order and SEC Clearance as required in accordance
with applicable Laws. On the date of mailing or delivery thereof, the Proxy
Statement/Circular shall comply in all material respects with all applicable
Laws and shall contain sufficient detail to permit the shareholders of Company
and Acquiror to form a reasoned judgment concerning the matters to be placed
before them at the Company Meeting and the Acquiror Meeting, as applicable.
Upon reasonable request, each Party shall furnish the other Party with all
information reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement / Circular.

 



 

(b) Each Party shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the other Party with copies of all written comments, and advise the
other Party of all oral comments, with respect to the Proxy Statement /
Circular received from the SEC. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information shall be discovered by Acquiror or Company that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement / Circular so that
such documentation would not include any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, then the Party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other Party, and to the extent required
by applicable Law, each of Acquiror and Company shall promptly file an
appropriate amendment with the SEC and relevant Canadian Securities
Authorities to the Proxy Statement / Circular describing such information and
each of Acquiror and Company shall promptly disseminate an appropriate

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the filing, mailing or delivery of
the Proxy Statement / Circular (or of any amendment or supplement to the
foregoing) or responding to any

 



      
 

 



 

comments of the SEC with respect either of the foregoing, each Party shall (i)

document or response all reasonable comments that the other Party proposes. On
the date of their filing or delivery, each Party shall provide the other Party
with a copy of all such filings with, and all such responses delivered to, the
SEC and the relevant Canadian Securities Authorities. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, no amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement / Circular shall be made
without the prior written consent of Acquiror; provided, however, that nothing
in this _Section 4.6(c)_ will limit the Companys ability to exercise its
rights under _Section 4.9_.

 



 

Section 4.7. _Shareholder Meetings._

 



 

(a) Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company
Meeting and the Acquiror Meeting (as applicable) to occur on the same date as
soon as reasonably practicable after the procurement of the Interim Order and
SEC Clearance for the purpose of obtaining the Continuance Requisite
Shareholder Vote and the Company Requisite Shareholder Vote in the case of
Company and the Acquiror Requisite Shareholder Vote in the case of Acquiror.
Except as required by Law or required by its shareholders, neither Acquiror
nor Company shall adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose for adjournment,
postponement or cancellation) its shareholders meeting without the prior
written consent of the other Party except as required for quorum purposes, to
comply with requirements of applicable Law (including any disclosure
obligations under Canadian or U.S. Laws provided that the Company uses
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such Laws in a timely manner),
by the Court or by the shareholders of Company. Company shall take all lawful
action to solicit the approval of the Continuance Resolution by the
Continuance Requisite Shareholder Vote and the Arrangement Resolution by the
Company Requisite Shareholder Vote, and Acquiror shall take all lawful action
to solicit the approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the Acquiror Requisite Shareholder Vote. Each Party will advise the other
Party as it may reasonably request, and at least on a daily basis on each of
the last ten business days prior to the date of the Company Meeting or
Acquiror Meeting (as applicable), as to the aggregate tally of the proxies
received by Company in respect of the Continuance Resolution and the
Arrangement Resolution or Acquiror in respect of the Acquiror Requisite
Shareholder Vote (as applicable).

 



 

(b) The Board of Directors of Company shall unanimously recommend approval of
the Continuance Resolution by the shareholders of the Company and the
Arrangement Resolution by the shareholders of Company and the holders of
Company Compensatory Awards to the effect set forth in _Section 2.21_ (the "
_Company Recommendation_ "), and the Board of Directors of Acquiror shall
unanimously recommend approval of the Share Issuance by the shareholders of
Acquiror to the effect set forth in _Section 3.15_ (the " _Acquiror
Recommendation_ "). The Board of Directors of each Party shall not make an
Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with, and subject to the
limitations set forth in, _Section 4.9_. Absent an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with, and subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 4.9_, the Board of Directors of a Party shall reconfirm its
recommendation to the effect set forth in _Section 2.21_ or _Section 3.15_
(as applicable) within three Business Days after a written request to do so by
the other Party. Notwithstanding any Adverse Recommendation Change or the
existence of any Takeover Proposal or any Superior

 



      
 

 



 

Proposal, Company shall cause this Agreement, the Continuance Resolution and
the Arrangement Resolution to be submitted to its shareholders and holders of
Company Compensatory Awards at the Company Meeting.

 



 

Section 4.8. _Stock Exchange Listing and De-Listing._ Acquiror shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Acquiror Common Stock
to be issued and paid in the Arrangement to be approved for listing on the New
York Stock Exchange prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of
issuance. Acquiror shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Company Common Shares to be de-listed from the New York Stock Exchange and de-
registered under the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 4.9. _No Solicitation._

 



 

(a) The Subject Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries, any of its or their respective directors, officers, employees or
any Representative to, directly or indirectly through another Person, (i)
solicit, initiate, cause, knowingly encourage, or knowingly facilitate, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Takeover Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Takeover Proposal, or furnish to any Person any
information in connection with or in furtherance of any Takeover Proposal;
provided that, so long as the Subject Company and its Representatives have
otherwise complied with this _Section 4.9_, none of the foregoing shall
prohibit the Subject Company and its representatives from contacting in
writing any Person or group of Persons who has made a Takeover Proposal after
the date of this Agreement solely to request the clarification of the terms
and conditions thereof so as to determine whether the Takeover Proposal is a
Superior Proposal, or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of the
Subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this _Section
4.9(a)_ by the Subject Company. The Subject Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and instruct its Representatives to, immediately cease and cause
to be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover Proposal, request the prompt
return or destruction of all confidential information previously furnished and
terminate access to any electronic dataroom. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing in this _Section 4.9(a)_, at any time prior to obtaining the
Subject Company Shareholder Approval (and in no event after obtaining such
Subject Company Shareholder Approval), in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof that the Subject Company
Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and of its outside counsel) constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, the Subject Company may,
if the Subject Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice
of its outside counsel) that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with
its fiduciary duties of the Subject Company under applicable Law, and subject
to compliance with _Section 4.9(c)_, (A) furnish information with respect to
the Subject Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person (and its
Representatives) making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (a copy of which shall be provided to the Other
Party promptly after its execution) not less restrictive of such Person than
the Confidentiality Agreement (the parties agreeing that the confidentiality
agreement shall include a standstill), provided, that all such oral or written

 



      
 

 



 

information (to the extent that such information has not been previously
provided to the Other Party) is provided or made available to the Other Party,
as the case may be, prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided or made available to such Person, as the case may be, and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude
Acquiror from considering, participating in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnishing to any Person any of Acquirors information in
connection with or in furtherance of, or entering into any agreement providing
for or in connection with, any inquiry, proposal or offer that would otherwise
constitute a Takeover Proposal (which, for purposes of this definition of a
Permitted Transaction, (x) the references to "15%" in the definition of
Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be "50%" and (y) clause (d) of such
definition will be excluded), so long as (1) such inquiry, proposal or offer
contemplates a transaction that would not require or be subject to an Adverse
Recommendation Change by Acquiror or a termination of this Agreement and (2)
with respect to the entry into any such agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by such agreement, such entry or consummation would
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair Acquirors ability
to consummate the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to the Termination Date (" _Permitted Transaction_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section 4.9(a)_ shall relieve any party
from its obligations under _Section 4.5_ of this Agreement.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean, with
respect to the Subject Company, any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not
conditional and whether or not withdrawn, (a) for a merger, consolidation,
arrangement, share exchange, dissolution, recapitalization or other business
combination involving the Subject Company, (b) for the issuance of 15% or more
of the equity securities of the Subject Company as consideration for the
assets or securities of another Person, (c) to acquire in any manner, directly
or indirectly, 15% or more of the equity securities of the Subject Company or
assets (including equity securities of any Subsidiary of the Subject Company)
that represent 15% or more of the total consolidated assets or revenues of the
Subject Company, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Permitted Transaction, or (d) any other transaction, the consummation of
which would reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or
materially delay the transactions contemplated hereby or which would
reasonably be expected to dilute materially the aggregate benefits of the
transactions contemplated hereby to the Party that is not the Subject Party.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Other Party_ " shall mean (a) Acquiror,
when used with respect to any Takeover Proposal for the Company, and (b) the
Company, when used with respect to any Takeover Proposal for Acquiror or any
Permitted Transaction.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subject Company_ " shall mean (a) the
Company, when used with respect to any Takeover Proposal for, or Intervening
Event of, the Company, and (b) Acquiror, when used with respect to any
Takeover Proposal for, or Intervening Event of, Acquiror or any Permitted
Transaction.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subject Company Board_ " shall mean (a) the
Board of Directors of Company, when the context refers to Company as the
Subject Company, and (b) the Board of Directors of Acquiror, when the context
refers to Acquiror as the Subject Company.

 



       
 

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Subject Company Shareholder Approval_ "
shall mean obtaining the Company Requisite Shareholder Vote or the Acquiror
Requisite Shareholder Vote, as the case may be.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide written offer made by a third party, that if consummated would result in
such Person (or its shareholders) owning, directly or indirectly, 50% or more
of the Company Common Shares or Acquiror Common Stock (excluding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), as the case may be, then
outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect
parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all or substantially all of the
total consolidated assets of the Subject Company (i) on terms which the
Subject Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice of a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and of its outside
counsel and in light of all relevant circumstances, including, without
limitation, all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement)
to be more favorable to the shareholders of the Subject Company from a
financial point of view than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) which is reasonably likely to be completed, taking into account any
financing and approval requirements and all other financial, legal, regulatory
and other aspects of such proposal and (iii) for which financing, if a cash
transaction (in whole or part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Subject Company Board.

 



 

(b) Neither the Subject Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Other Party), or propose to
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to the Other Party), the Company
Recommendation, where Company is the Subject Company, or the Acquiror
Recommendation, where Acquiror is the Subject Company, (it being understood
that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to a Takeover
Proposal, other than a "stop, look and listen" statement in compliance with
Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall be considered an adverse
modification) or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this _subclause (i)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation
Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
or allow the Subject Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, arrangement agreement, acquisition agreement,
option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other
similar agreement constituting or related to, any Takeover Proposal (other
than a confidentiality agreement pursuant to _Section 4.9(a)_).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Subject Company Board may, prior to
obtaining the Subject Company Shareholder Approval (and in no event after
obtaining such applicable Subject Company Shareholder Approval), if the
Subject Company Board determines in good faith (after receiving advice of its
outside counsel) that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties of the Subject Company under applicable Law, (1) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in light of a Superior Proposal or terminate
this Agreement solely in order to concurrently enter into an agreement with
respect to a Superior Proposal or (2) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
solely in response to an Intervening Event, but, in each case, only at a time
that is after the third Business Day following the Other Partys receipt of
written notice from the Subject Company (an " _Adverse Notice_ ") advising the
Other Party that the Subject Company Board has determined, in the case of the
preceding _subclause (1)_, that a Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal,
that the Subject Company Board intends to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate

 



      
 

 



 

this Agreement and containing all information required by _Section 4.9(c)_,
together with copies of any written offer or proposal in respect of such
Superior Proposal, (it being agreed that any amendment to the financial terms
or other material terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Adverse
Notice and a new three Business Day period), and, in the case of the preceding
_subclause (2)_ , that the Subject Company Board intends to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change, a description of the Intervening Event and the reasons
for the Adverse Recommendation Change (it being agreed that changes in
circumstances shall require a new Adverse Notice and a new three Business Day
period). In determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or to
terminate this Agreement in response to a Superior Proposal, the Subject
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement in a bona fide written proposal by the Other Party (in response to
an Adverse Notice or otherwise) in determining whether such third party
Takeover Proposal still constitutes a Superior Proposal. In determining
whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event, the Subject Company Board shall take into account any changes to the
terms of this Agreement in a bona fide written proposal by the Other Party (in
response to an Adverse Notice or otherwise) in determining whether an Adverse
Recommendation Change ceases to be necessary in order to comply with the
Subject Company Boards fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Subject
Company under applicable Law. In all cases, during the three Business Day
period following delivery of an Adverse Notice, the Subject Company and its
Representatives shall, if requested by the Other Party, negotiate in good
faith with the Other Party and the Other Partys Representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms of this Agreement as would enable the Other Party to
proceed with the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated hereby on
such adjusted terms without effecting an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminating this Agreement, as applicable.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Intervening Event_ " shall mean a material
event, circumstance, change or effect that was not known or reasonably
foreseeable (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the probability or
magnitude of consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable)
to the Subject Company Board on the date of this Agreement, which event,
circumstance, change or effect (including any change in probability or
magnitude of consequences) becomes known to the Subject Company Board before
the Subject Company Shareholder Approval is obtained; provided, that in no
event shall (i) any action taken by either Party pursuant to and in compliance
with the affirmative covenants set forth in _Section 4.5_, and the
consequences of any such action, constitute an Intervening Event, (ii) the
receipt, existence of or terms of a Takeover Proposal for the Subject Company
or any inquiry relating thereto or the consequences thereof constitute an
Intervening Event of the Subject Company, (iii) any decline in the market
price or trading volume of the securities of the Other Party, (iv) any change
in general economic, political, business or other capital market conditions
(including prevailing interest rates and any effects on the economy arising as
a result of acts of terrorism), (v) any change or developments in the market
price for oil, natural gas or other commodity prices or for raw material
inputs and end products, (vi) any change affecting the oil and gas exploration
and production industry generally, (vii) any change in accounting requirements
or principles imposed by GAAP or any change in law after the Effective Date,
(viii) earthquakes, any weather-related or other force majeure event or
natural disasters or outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of war;
except in each of cases (iv), (v), (vi), (vii) and (viii), where such event
disproportionately affects the Subject Company, taken as a whole, relative to
the Other Party, taken as a whole, constitute an Intervening Event of the
Subject Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Subject Company set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 4.9_, the Subject Company shall
promptly advise the Other Party orally and in writing of any request for
information or other inquiry that the Subject Company reasonably believes
could lead to any Takeover Proposal or Permitted Transaction, the financial
and other material terms and conditions of any such request, Takeover
Proposal, Permitted Transaction or inquiry (including any changes thereto),
the identity of the Person making any such request, Takeover Proposal,
Permitted Transaction or inquiry, and copies of any written offer, proposal or
other documentation in respect of such request, Takeover Proposal, Permitted
Transaction or inquiry. The Subject Company shall promptly keep the Other
Party reasonably informed of the status and material details (including any
change to the financial and other material terms thereof) of any such request,
Takeover Proposal, Permitted Transaction or inquiry.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 4.9_ shall prohibit the Subject
Company or the Subject Company Board from (i) complying with the Subject
Companys obligations required under Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required disclosure to the shareholders of
the Subject Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Subject Company
Board (after consultation with outside counsel), failure to so disclose would
constitute a violation of applicable Law; provided, however, that any such
disclosure relating to a Takeover Proposal or Intervening Event (other than a
"stop, look and listen" statement in compliance with Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act) shall be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Subject Company Board reaffirms its recommendation and declaration of
advisability of this Agreement and the Arrangement.

(a) Company shall, if reasonably requested by Acquiror, cooperate in good

Consent Solicitations and deliver such documentation to holders of the Notes.
Acquiror, after having consulted with Company, shall have the sole right to
control decisions with respect to the strategy and conduct of the Consent
Solicitations (including selecting any solicitation agent(s) in connection
with the Consent Solicitations and modifying the terms and structure of the
Consent Solicitations as set forth in _Exhibit D_; provided, however, that
Acquiror shall not be required to modify the terms of the Consent
Solicitations set forth therein). Company shall provide and cause its
Subsidiaries to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Acquiror in
connection with the Consent Solicitations including assisting in the
preparation and execution of all documents required in connection therewith.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of Companys auditor to
the use of its report on the most recently available audited consolidated
financial statements of Company in connection with the registered offering
contemplated by the Consent Solicitations and use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters (providing
"negative assurance" comfort) and drafts thereof to the solicitation agent(s)
in connection with the Consent Solicitation; (ii) make available, at
reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, the necessary employees
and advisors of Company and its Subsidiaries to attend due diligence sessions;
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the reasonable cooperation
and assistance of counsel to Company and its Subsidiaries in providing
customary legal opinions and negative assurance statements; and (iv) provide
customary information, documents, authorization letters and certificates and

customary terms relating to representations and warranties, indemnification
provisions and necessary closing documentation. All documentation for the
Consent Solicitations will be customary for transactions of this nature and
shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and Company.
The Consent Solicitations and other actions taken in connection therewith
shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indentures
and all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and other applicable Laws.
If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information shall be
discovered by Acquiror or Company that should be set forth in an amendment or

 



      
 

 



 

supplement to documents mailed or delivered to Note holders in respect to the
Consent Solicitations so that such documentation would not include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, then
the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
Party, and to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall promptly be prepared and, if
required, filed with the SEC and/or disseminated to the holders of Notes. In
accordance with the terms of the Consent Solicitations, assuming the requisite
consents are received, Company and its Subsidiaries and Acquiror and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall execute supplemental indentures to each of
the Indentures among Company, the guarantors named therein and the trustee
party thereto reflecting the Indenture Amendments, which supplemental
indentures shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to Acquiror and Company
and become operative as set forth in _Exhibit D_.

 



 

(e) Acquiror shall promptly pay, or reimburse Companys payment of, any
consent payment to holders of the Notes in connection with the Consent
Solicitation and pay the fees and out-of-pocket expenses of any dealer
manager, information agent, solicitation agent, tabulation agent, depositary
or other agent retained in connection with the Consent Solicitation upon the
incurrence of such fees and out-of-pocket expenses. Acquiror shall promptly,
upon request by Company, reimburse Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by Company
in connection with the cooperation of Company contemplated by this Section
4.10 and shall indemnify and hold harmless Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the Consent Solicitation and any information used in connection
therewith, except with respect to any information provided by Company.

 



 

Section 4.11. _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance._ From and
after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall, or shall cause Company or Amalco to,
indemnify and hold harmless all current and former officers and directors of
Company and its Subsidiaries to the same extent such Persons may be
indemnified and held harmless as of the date of this Agreement by Company
pursuant to the articles of continuation or by-laws of Company for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including those in
respect of the Arrangement and the other transactions contemplated hereby.
Company shall be permitted, prior to the Effective Time, to obtain and fully
pay for a "tail" insurance policy in respect of Companys current directors
and officers with an extended reporting period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance with benefits and levels of coverage at least as favorable as
Companys existing policy with respect to matters existing or occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions or actions contemplated hereby); provided, however, that in
no event shall Company expend for such policy an annual premium amount in
excess of 300% of the amount paid by Company in its current fiscal year, but
in such case may purchase as much coverage as is available for such amount. If
any person makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this _Section 4.11_ that is denied by Acquiror, Company or Amalco, and
a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such indemnified person is
entitled to such indemnification, then Acquiror, Company and Amalco shall pay
such indemnified persons costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees
and expenses, incurred

 



      
 

 



 

in connection with pursuing such claim against Acquiror, Company or Amalco.
The rights of the indemnified persons under this _Section 4.11_ shall be in
addition to any rights such indemnified persons may have under the constating
documents of Company or Amalco, or under any applicable Law. All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto in favor of any indemnified person as provided in
the constating documents of Company shall survive the Effective Time for a
period of not less than six years and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such indemnified person. The provisions of this _Section
4.11_ shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and are intended for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the indemnified persons, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators
and legal personal representatives and shall be binding on each of Acquiror,
Company and Amalco and its successors and assigns, and, for such purpose only,
Company hereby confirms that it is acting as trustee on their behalf.

 



 

Section 4.12. _Public Announcements._ Each Party shall consult with, and

with respect to Company Common Shares) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by _Section 1.1_ by each officer or director of Company who may
become subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act as an officer or director of Acquiror to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 4.14. _Takeover Laws._ If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or similar Law shall become applicable to
the transactions contemplated hereby, then Company and the Board of Directors
of Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to grant
such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to minimize the effects of any such
statute or similar Law on the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 4.15. _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide the other Party with prompt written
notice of: (a) any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which such Party
is aware and that would be reasonably likely to (i) cause any representation
or warranty made by such Party in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in
any material respect, (ii) cause any covenant made by such Party in this
Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied in all material respects or
(iii) result in any condition set forth in _Article 5_ to be unsatisfied at
any time from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time; (b) any

required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

_Section 4.15_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
under this Agreement to the Party receiving such notice.

 



 

Section 4.16. _Certain Litigation._ Each Party to this Agreement shall
promptly advise the other Parties orally and in writing of any shareholder
litigation against the Party and/or its directors and officers relating to
this Agreement, the Arrangement and/or the transactions contemplated by this

such shareholder litigation. Each party shall give the other Parties the
opportunity to consult with the Party regarding the defense or settlement of
any such shareholder litigation, shall give due consideration to the other
Partys advice with respect to such shareholder litigation and shall not
settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and consideration;
provided, however, that Company further will not, without Acquirors prior
written consent, settle any shareholder litigation.

Subsidiaries as Acquiror shall request with reasonable advance notice.

satisfactory to Company, to deliver an opinion to Company, on the basis of
certain facts, representations and assumptions set

should qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment; provided, however, in no event
shall the delivery of the opinion referred to in this sentence be a condition
to Companys obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Arrangement. Acquiror shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Foley and Lardner LLP, counsel to Acquiror, or such
other Tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror and Company, to deliver
an opinion to Acquiror, on the basis of certain facts, representations and
assumptions set forth in such opinion, dated the Closing Date, to the effect

such opinions, such counsels may require and shall be entitled to rely upon
reasonable and customary representations and covenants, including those
contained in representation letters signed by officers of Acquiror, the
Company and Acquiror Canadian Sub.

 



 

Section 4.21. _Employee Matters._

 



 

(a) Acquiror shall provide, or cause its Subsidiaries or Company or its
Subsidiaries to provide, to employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time who continue employment with Acquiror,

transaction contemplated hereby is consummated, Acquiror shall cause Company

substantially comparable in the aggregate to the level of such benefits
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.
During the calendar year after the calendar year in which the transaction
contemplated hereby is consummated, Acquiror shall provide, or cause its

Continuing Employee becomes a participant, such Continuing Employee shall
receive full credit for service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting, to the same extent
such service was recognized as of the Effective Time under a comparable plan
of the Company and its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee
participated (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined
benefit pension plans, special or early retirement

 



      
 

 



 

programs, window separation programs, or similar plans which may be in effect
from time to time); provided that in no event shall such service recognition
result in any duplication of benefits; and provided further that with respect
to any such plan maintained by Acquiror or any of its subsidiaries that is
insured, the insurance carrier consents to the recognition of such prior
service credit, if required. Company shall provide to Acquiror a list of each
Continuing Employee and his or her service credit under each Company Employee
Benefit Plan as of the Effective Time, and Acquiror shall be entitled to rely
on such information.

 



 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of any insurance
policy, Acquiror shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements under any welfare benefit plan
maintained by Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries in which the Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from
and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable plan of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employee participated.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 4.21_ shall (i) be treated as an amendment of,
or undertaking to amend, any benefit plan, (ii) prohibit Acquiror or any of
its Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan or
(iii) confer any rights or benefits on any person other than the parties to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit Acquiror from terminating or causing the Company to terminate (i) any
Acquiror employee benefit plan following the Effective Time or (ii) the
employment (for any reason or for no reason) of any Continuing Employee
following the Effective Time without the provision of further salary, bonus or
benefits following such termination except to the extent required by
applicable Law.

the failure of any condition set forth in _Article 5_ to be satisfied and the
