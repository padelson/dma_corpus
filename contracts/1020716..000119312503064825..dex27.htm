Consideration Shares determined by  _dividing_ (A) the Dissenters Excess
Reserve Amount (as defined below) by (B) the Average Closing Price (the
"Dissenters Escrow Shares"). After payment of $6,000,000 in aggregate cash

Shares as determined in accordance with Article 13 of Georgia Law. Upon the
earlier of (i) satisfaction in full of all the rights granted to holders of
Dissenting Shares under Article 13 of Georgia Law,  



 

A-5 ##### Table of Contents

   

 or (ii) waiver or withdrawal of dissenters rights by one or more holders of
Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock such that
the number of Dissenting Shares is reduced to ten percent (10%) or less of

Shareholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions of the
Dissenters Escrow. For purposes of this Agreement, "Dissenters Excess
Reserve Amount" means fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which (A) the
Aggregate Dissenting Shares Transaction Value (as defined below) _exceeds_ (B)
$6,000,000. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Aggregate Dissenting Shares
Transaction Value" shall be determined by _multiplying_ (A) the number of
shares of Pumatech Common Stock that would have been issued in the Merger in
consideration of the Dissenting Shares had the holders thereof not exercised
their dissenters rights, in each case based on the Exchange Ratio applicable
to each class and/or series of Synchrologic capital stock comprising the
Dissenting Shares _by_ (B) the Average Closing Price. At the Closing,
Synchrologic shall provide Pumatech a schedule of Dissenting Shares, which
shall reflect the names of the holders of such Dissenting Shares and
Synchrologics calculation of the Aggregate Dissenting Shares Transaction
Value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Pumatech shall not enter into
any settlement of dissenters rights or otherwise make any payment in
consideration of Dissenting Shares without the prior written consent of the
Shareholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.



 Section 2.3 _ Dissenting Shares_.



(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock held by a
holder who has exercised such holders dissenters rights in accordance with
Article 13 of Georgia Law, and who, as of the Effective Time, has not
effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights ("Dissenting Shares"),
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive Pumatech Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, but the holder of the Dissenting Shares shall
only be entitled to such rights as are granted to dissenting shareholders by
Georgia Law.



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.3(a), if any holder of
shares of Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock who
demands his, her or its dissenters rights with respect to such shares shall
effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his,
her or its rights to receive payment for the fair market value of such shares
under Georgia Law, then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive Pumatech Common Stock
as provided in Section 2.1(c) upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares; _provided_ that if such holder
effectively withdraws or loses his, her or its right to receive payment for
the fair market value of such shares after the Effective Time, then, at such
time Pumatech will deposit in the escrow created pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement additional certificates representing such holders Pro Rata Portion
of the Escrow Shares.



(c) Synchrologic shall give Pumatech (i) prompt notice of any written demands
for payment with respect to any shares of capital stock of Synchrologic
pursuant to Article 13 of Georgia Law, withdrawals of such demands, and
any other instruments served pursuant to Georgia Law and received by
Synchrologic and (ii) the opportunity to participate at its own expense in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters rights
under Georgia Law. Synchrologic shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Pumatech, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for dissenters rights with respect to Synchrologic Common Stock or
Synchrologic Preferred Stock or offer to settle or compromise any such
demands.



 Section 2.4 _ Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates ("Certificates") which represented shares of
Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall have the right to surrender each Certificate to an
exchange agent to be appointed by Pumatech (the "Exchange Agent"), and
receive promptly in exchange for all  



 

A-6 ##### Table of Contents

   

 Certificates held by such holder a certificate representing the number of
whole shares of Pumatech Common Stock (other than the Escrow Shares) into
which the Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock evidenced
by the Certificates so surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to the
provisions of Article II of this Agreement. The surrender of Certificates
shall be accompanied by duly completed and executed Letters of Transmittal in
such form as may be reasonably specified by Pumatech. Until surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate, which prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock, shall be deemed
for all corporate purposes from and after the Effective Time to evidence
ownership of the number of whole shares of Pumatech Common Stock into which
the shares of Synchrologic Common Stock have been converted but shall,
subject to applicable dissenters rights under Georgia Law and Section 2.3 of
this Agreement, have no other rights. Subject to applicable dissenters rights
under Georgia Law and Section 2.3 of this Agreement, from and after
the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Synchrologic Common Stock and
Synchrologic Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights in respect of such
shares and their rights shall be solely in respect of the Pumatech Common
Stock into which such shares of Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic
Preferred Stock have been converted. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of Synchrologic
of shares of Synchrologic Common Stock and Synchrologic Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b) If any shares of Pumatech Common Stock are to be issued in the name of a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate(s) surrendered in
exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition to the issuance of
such shares that (i) the Certificate(s) so surrendered shall be transferable,
and shall be properly assigned, endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock
powers, (ii) such transfer shall otherwise be proper and (iii) the person
requesting such transfer shall pay Pumatech, or its exchange agent, any
transfer or other taxes payable by reason of the foregoing or establish to
the satisfaction of Pumatech that such taxes have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Pumatech nor
Synchrologic shall be liable to a holder of shares of Synchrologic Common
Stock or Synchrologic Preferred Stock for shares of Pumatech Common Stock
issuable to such holder pursuant to the provisions of Article II of this
Agreement that are delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.



(c) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Pumatech shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Pumatech Common
Stock issuable in exchange therefor pursuant to the provisions of Article II
of the Agreement. The board of directors of Pumatech may in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to Pumatech an
indemnity agreement or bond against any claim that may be made against
Pumatech with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.



 Section 2.5 _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Pumatech Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect
to the shares of Pumatech Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the
effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Pumatech Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
previously paid with respect to such whole shares of Pumatech Common Stock,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to
such whole shares of Pumatech Common Stock. 



 Section 2.6 _ No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip
representing fractional shares of Pumatech Common Stock shall be issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share

 interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Pumatech. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Synchrologic Common Stock or Synchrologic
Preferred Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Pumatech Common Stock (after
taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive,
in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional
part of a share of Pumatech Common Stock multiplied by the Average Closing
Price.



 Section 2.7 _ Tax and Accounting Consequences_.



(a) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties
hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning

(a) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(a) of the _Pumatech Disclosure
Schedules_ , Pumatech owns all right, title and interest in and to, or
otherwise possesses legally enforceable rights, or is licensed to use in
accordance with the Third Party Licenses, all patents, copyrights, technology,
software, software tools, know-how, processes, trade secrets, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, Internet domain names and other
proprietary rights used in the conduct of Pumatechs business as currently
conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted (the "Pumatech Proprietary
Rights"), including, without limitation, the technology, information,
databases, data lists, data compilations, and all proprietary rights
developed or discovered or used in connection with or contained in all
versions and implementations of Pumatechs World Wide Web sites or any product
which has been or is being distributed or sold by Pumatech or, to the
knowledge of Pumatech, currently is under development by Pumatech
(collectively, the "Pumatech Products"), free and clear of all liens, claims
and encumbrances except for such liens, claims or encumbrances incurred in
the ordinary course of business or which do not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Pumatech. All of Pumatechs patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names or
Internet domain name registrations related to or in the Pumatech Products are
valid, subsisting and in full force and effect, and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not alter or impair any such
rights resulting in a Material Adverse Effect on Pumatech. Except as
set forth on Schedule 4.11(a) of the _Pumatech Disclosure Schedules_ , no
claims have been asserted or, to Pumatechs knowledge, threatened against
Pumatech (and Pumatech is not aware of any claims which are reasonably likely
to be asserted or threatened against Pumatech or which have been asserted or,
to Giants knowledge, threatened against others relating to Pumatech
Proprietary Rights or Pumatech Products) by any person challenging Pumatechs
use, possession, manufacture, sale or distribution of Pumatech Products under
any Pumatech Proprietary Rights (including, without limitation, the Third
Party Technology) or challenging or questioning the validity or effectiveness
of any material license or agreement relating thereto (including, without  



 

A-27 ##### Table of Contents

   

 limitation, the Third Party Licenses) or alleging a violation of any
persons or entitys privacy, personal or confidentiality rights. Except
as set forth on Schedule 4.11(a) of the _Pumatech Disclosure Schedules_ , to
the knowledge of Pumatech, there is no valid basis for any claim of the type
specified in the immediately preceding sentence which could in any material
way relate to or interfere with the continued enhancement and exploitation by
Pumatech of any of the Pumatech Products. To Pumatechs knowledge, none of the
Pumatech Products nor the use or exploitation of any Pumatech Proprietary
Rights in Pumatechs current business infringes on the rights of or
constitutes misappropriation of any proprietary information or intangible
property right of any third person or entity, including without limitation any
patent, trade secret, copyright, trademark or trade name, and except as set
forth on Schedule 4.11(a) of the _Pumatech Disclosure Schedules_ , Pumatech
has not been sued or named in any suit, action or proceeding which involves a
claim of such infringement, misappropriation or unfair competition.



(b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(a) of the _Pumatech Disclosure

distribute, market or exploit any of the Pumatech Products or any adaptations,

portion thereof (the "Pumatech Reseller Agreements") other than in the
ordinary course of business and consistent with standard and customary
practices in its industry. Except with respect to the rights of third parties
to the Third Party Technology or the distribution Agreements, no third party
has any express right to reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any works or
materials of which any of the Pumatech Products are a "derivative work" as
that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act, Title 17, U.S.C.
Section 101.



(c) All material designs, drawings, specifications, source code, object code,
scripts, documentation, flow charts, diagrams, data lists, databases,
compilations and information incorporating, embodying or reflecting any of the
Pumatech Products at any stage of their development excluding the Third Party
Technology (the "Pumatech Components") were written, developed and created
solely and exclusively by employees of Pumatech without the assistance of any
third party or entity or were created by third parties who created Pumatech
components ad "works made for hire" under 17 U.S.C. Section 201(b) or
assigned ownership of their rights to Pumatech by means of valid and
enforceable confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, examples of
which have been delivered to Synchrologic. Pumatech has at all times used
commercially reasonable efforts customary in its industry to treat the
Pumatech Proprietary Rights related to Pumatech Products and Pumatech
Components as containing trade secrets and has not disclosed or otherwise
dealt with such items in a manner intended or reasonably likely to cause the
loss of such trade secrets by release into the public domain which would
result in a Material Adverse Effect on Pumatech.



(d) To Pumatechs knowledge, no employee, contractor or consultant of
Pumatech is in violation in any material respect of any term of any written
employment contract, patent disclosure agreement or any other written contract
or agreement relating to the relationship of any such employee, consultant or
contractor with Pumatech, to Pumatechs knowledge, any other party because of
the nature of the business conducted by Pumatech or proposed to be conducted
by Pumatech excluding Third Party Technology.

independent contractors, if any) has executed a confidentiality, non-
disclosure and proprietary inventions assignment agreement pursuant to the
form of agreement previously provided to Synchrologic or its representatives.



(f) No product liability or warranty claims are pending or, to Pumatechs
knowledge, threatened against Pumatech that would result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Pumatech.

disclosure, infringement or misappropriation of any Pumatech Proprietary
Rights, or any Third Party Technology to the extent licensed by or through
Pumatech, by any third party, including any employee, former employee or
independent contractor of Pumatech. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11(g)
of the _Pumatech Disclosure Schedules_ , Pumatech has not entered into any
agreement to indemnify any other person against any charge of infringement of
any Pumatech Proprietary Rights other than in the ordinary course of business.

protect and preserve the confidentiality and proprietary nature of all
material intellectual property and other Confidential

 information relating to taxes, commitments, contracts, leases, licenses, and

shall cause its accountants to cooperate with Pumatech and its agents in
making available all financial information requested, including without
limitation the right to examine all working papers pertaining to all financial
statements prepared or audited by such accountants. No information or
knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section shall affect

 Section 5.4 _ Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Synchrologic will
use its reasonable commercial efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all

contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, to obtain all consents and authorizations of
third parties and to make all filings with, and give all notices to, third
parties which may be necessary or reasonably required on its part in order to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Synchrologic
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any and all consents
necessary with respect to those Material Contracts listed on Schedule 5.4 of
the _Synchrologic Disclosure Schedules_ required to consummate the Merger (the
"Material Consents").



 Section 5.5 _ No Solicitation_. From the date hereof until the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, Synchrologic will not,
and will not permit or cause any of its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, consultants and other agents to, directly or indirectly,
take any action to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate the making of
any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below) or any inquiry with respect
thereto or engage in discussions or negotiations with any person with respect
thereto, or disclose any nonpublic information relating to Synchrologic
(including this Agreement) or afford access to the properties, books or
records of Synchrologic to, any person that has made any Acquisition
Proposal. Synchrologic will, and will cause the other persons listed in the
first sentence of this Section 5.5 to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated all discussions and negotiations, if any, that have taken place
prior to the date hereof with any parties with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.5
shall prevent Synchrologic from entering into discussions or negotiations
with, or providing any information to, any person or entity in connection with
a bona fide Acquisition Proposal received from such person or entity that the
board of directors of Synchrologic, after consulting with its financial
advisor, if any, and legal counsel, determines in good faith could lead to a
Superior Proposal (as defined below), so long as prior to entering into
discussions or negotiations with such person, Synchrologic receives from such
person an executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to
Synchrologic than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.
Synchrologic will promptly notify (which notice shall be provided orally and
in writing, shall identify the person making such Acquisition Proposal and
shall provide a summary of the proposed terms of the Acquisition Proposal to
the extent known by Synchrologic at such time or any modification to a prior
Acquisition Proposal provided to Synchrologic by such person) Pumatech after
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any such modification, but in no event
more than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of an Acquisition Proposal. If
the board of directors of Synchrologic shall determine that an Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, Synchrologic shall notify Pumatech in writing
of such determination (prior to any communication of such fact to the person
making the Acquisition Proposal). Synchrologic shall provide Pumatech with
at least two (2) business days or forty-eight (48) hours prior written
notice of a meeting of Synchrologics board of directors at which such board
of directors is reasonably expected to consider and approve a Superior
Proposal and together with such notice a summary of the terms of the Superior
Proposal that is to be presented to the board of directors at such meeting.
Nothing contained in this Section 5.5 shall limit Synchrologics obligation
under Section 7.11(b) to convene the Synchrologic Shareholders Meeting.



For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any bona fide
offer or proposal for, or any indication of interest in, a merger or other
business combination involving Synchrologic, the acquisition of a majority of
the equity in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, Synchrologic, in
one transaction or series of related transactions, or an exclusive license of
a material portion of Synchrologics Proprietary Rights, in each  



 

A-35 ##### Table of Contents

   

 case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona
fide Acquisition Proposal on terms that the board of directors of
Synchrologic determines in its good faith judgment, taking into account all
the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal, including any break-up
fees, expense reimbursement provisions, financing requirements and
contingencies (including availability of financing) and conditions to
consummation, are more favorable to the Synchrologic shareholders than this
Agreement and the Merger taken as a whole.

PRECLOSING AND OTHER COVENANTS OF PUMATECH AND SUB



 Section 6.1 _ Reservation of Pumatech Common Stock_. Pumatech shall
prior to the Effective Time reserve for issuance, out of its authorized but
unissued capital stock, the maximum number of shares of Pumatech Common Stock
as may be issuable upon consummation of the Merger.



 Section 6.2 _ Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Pumatech and Sub
will use their reasonable commercial efforts to satisfy or cause to be
satisfied all the conditions precedent which are set forth in Sections 8.1
and 8.3, and Pumatech and Sub will use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated, and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to obtain all consents and
authorizations of third parties and to make all filings with, and give all
notices to, third parties which may be necessary or reasonably required on its
part in order to effect the transactions contemplated hereby.



 Section 6.3 _ Stock Options_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each Synchrologic Option outstanding at the
Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Pumatech and
deemed to constitute an option (a "Pumatech Option") to acquire, on the same
terms and conditions as were applicable under the Synchrologic Option (except
for any right of first refusal or repurchase provisions contained in the
Synchrologic Option which shall cease to apply after the Effective Time), the
same number of shares of Pumatech Common Stock as the holder of such
Synchrologic Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger
had such holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole number), at a price per
share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (i) the aggregate
exercise price for the shares of Synchrologic Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Synchrologic Option _divided_ by (ii) the number
of full shares of Pumatech Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such
Pumatech Option in accordance with the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the case of any Synchrologic Option to which Section 422 of the Code
applies ("incentive stock options"), the option price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise
of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of
the Code. Concurrently with the assumption of the Synchrologic Options by
Pumatech at the Effective Time, all Synchrologic Options that then remain
unvested will immediately and fully vest, with no further action required by
Synchrologic, Pumatech or the holders of such Synchrologic Options. In
connection with the assumption by Pumatech of the Synchrologic Options
pursuant to this Section 6.3(a), Synchrologic shall be deemed to have assigned
to Pumatech, effective at the Effective Time, Synchrologics right, if any,
to repurchase unvested shares of Synchrologic Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of the Synchrologic Options or previously issued upon the exercise of
options granted under the Synchrologic Option Plan, in accordance with the
terms of the Synchrologic Option Plan and the related stock option agreements
and stock purchase agreements entered into under the Synchrologic Option Plan.



(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any event no
later than the date required by the applicable Synchrologic Option Plan,
Pumatech shall deliver to the participants in the Synchrologic Option Plan
appropriate notice setting forth such participants rights pursuant thereto
and the grants pursuant to the Synchrologic Option Plans shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (subject  



 

A-36 ##### Table of Contents

   

 to the adjustments required by this Section 6.4 after giving effect to the
Merger). Pumatech shall comply with the terms of the Synchrologic Option Plans
and the parties intend that, to the extent required by, and subject to the
provisions of, such Synchrologic Option Plan and Sections 422 and 424(a) of
the Code, that Synchrologic Options which qualified as incentive stock options
prior the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options after
the Effective Time, and this provision shall be interpreted consistent with
that intent.



(c) Prior to the Closing Date, Pumatech shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Pumatech
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Synchrologic Options assumed in
accordance with this Section 6.3. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time and in any event no later than ten (10) business days after the Closing
Date, Pumatech shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate forms) under the Securities Act or another
appropriate form with respect to the shares of Pumatech Common Stock subject
to such options and shall use its best efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such options remain outstanding. 



 Section 6.4 _ Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Synchrologic
Warrant outstanding at the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall
be assumed by Pumatech and deemed to constitute a warrant (a "Pumatech
Warrant") to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under the Synchrologic Warrant, the same number of shares of Pumatech Common
Stock as the holder of such Synchrologic Warrant would have been entitled to
receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such warrant in full
immediately prior to the Effective Time (rounded down to the nearest whole
number), at a price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to
(i) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of Synchrologic Common Stock
or Synchrologic Preferred Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such
Synchrologic Warrant _divided_ by (ii) the number of full shares of Pumatech
Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such Pumatech Warrant in
accordance with the foregoing.



 Section 6.5 _ Certain Employee Benefit Matters_. From and after the
Effective Time, all employees of Synchrologic who continue as employees of
Pumatech or a Subsidiary of Pumatech at the Effective Time will be provided
with employee benefits by the Surviving Corporation or Pumatech which in the
aggregate are no less favorable to such employees than those provided from
time to time by Pumatech to its similarly situated employees. Each employee
of Synchrologic that becomes a participant in any employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement of Pumatech, shall be given credit for all
service prior to the Effective Time with Synchrologic to the
extent permissible under such plan, program, policy or arrangement and any
waiting period for participation shall be waived to the extent permissible
under such plan, program, policy or arrangement.



 Section 6.6 _ Conduct of Pumatech Business Prior to Effective Time_.
Except (i) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) as described in
Section 6.6 of the _Pumatech Disclosure Schedules_ , or (iii) to the extent
that Synchrologic shall otherwise consent in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably delayed or withheld), during the period from the date hereof to
the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Pumatech shall, and shall cause each of its

consistent with past practices and, to the extent consistent therewith, and
with no less diligence and effort than would be applied in the absence of this
Agreement, seek to preserve intact its current business organizations, keep
available the service of its current officers and employees and preserve
its relationships with customers, suppliers, distributors, lessors,
creditors, employees, contractors and others having business dealings with it
with the intention that its goodwill and ongoing businesses shall be
unimpaired at the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement and except
as described in Section 6.6 of the _Pumatech Disclosure Schedules_ , between
the date hereof and the Effective Time, neither Pumatech nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably delayed or withheld) of Synchrologic:

or bylaws (or other similar governing instrument);

division, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets with

(vi) fail to file any material Tax Returns when due, fail to cause such Tax
Returns when filed to be materially true, correct and complete, prepare or
fail to file any Tax Return in a manner inconsistent with past practices in

Return of the Pumatech, take any position, make any election, or adopt any
method that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or methods
used in preparing or filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods, in each
case, except to the extent required by Applicable Law, or fail to pay any
material Taxes when due; or

with another business, corporation, partnership or other business

 Section 6.7 _ Access to Information_. Until the Closing, Pumatech shall
allow Synchrologic and its agents and representatives reasonable free access

Section 10.1 above) that the Synchrologic Indemnified Parties have incurred
by reason of the untruth, inaccuracy, breach or alleged breach by Pumatech of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Pumatech contained in
this Agreement or in the certificates to be delivered pursuant to Section
8.3(a) and (b) (all such calculations of Damages shall take into account any
offset benefits or insurance proceeds received in connection with the matter
out of which such Damages shall arise).



 Section 10.3 _ Escrow Fund and Exclusive Remedies_.



(a) As security and the sole and exclusive recourse against the Former
Synchrologic Shareholders for the indemnities in Section 10.1, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Escrow Shares shall be deposited
with U.S. Bank Trust, National Association (or such other institution selected
by Pumatech with the reasonable consent of Synchrologic) as escrow agent
(the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to constitute the Escrow Fund (the "Escrow
Fund") and to be governed by the terms set forth in this Article X and in the
Escrow Agreement. Pumatech and Sub agree that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary under this Agreement, the indemnification provisions of this Article
X shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Pumatech Indemnified Parties
for any claim for Damages, absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation
on the part of Synchrologic. The parties acknowledge and agree that
rescission shall not be a remedy available to any party hereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and
absent fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of Pumatech, the
sole and exclusive remedy of any Synchrologic Indemnified Party in respect of
any claim for indemnification or reimbursement for the indemnities in Section
10.2 hereof, and Pumatechs and the Surviving Corporations maximum aggregate
liability for indemnification or reimbursement of Damages with respect to
claims for indemnification under this Agreement by the Synchrologic
Indemnified Parties shall be limited to and shall not exceed the aggregate
cash value of the Escrow Shares initially placed in the Escrow Fund (with such
value determined by multiplying the total number of Escrow Shares placed in
the Escrow Fund by the Average Closing Price). 



 Section 10.4 _ Damage Threshold_.



(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Former Synchrologic
Shareholders shall have any liability under Section 10.1 and Pumatech may not
receive any shares from the Escrow Fund unless and until an Officers
Certificate or Certificates (as defined in Section 10.6 below) for an
aggregate amount of Pumatechs Damages in excess of $500,000 (the
"Damages Threshold") has been delivered to the Shareholders Agent and to the
Escrow Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that after an Officers Certificate or
Certificates for an aggregate of $500,000 in Damages has been
delivered, Pumatech shall be entitled (subject to the provisions of this
Article X) to receive Escrow Shares equal in value to the full amount of
Damages identified in such Officers Certificate or Certificates; and
_provided_ _further_ ,  _however_ , that the $500,000 threshold amount
contemplated by this Section 10.4 shall not be applicable to claims made
against the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 10.1(b) above, which claims shall
be subject to indemnification and reimbursement on a first dollar basis.
Additionally, claims made against the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 10.1(b)
shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether the aggregate amount
of Pumatechs Damages exceeds the Damages Threshold. 



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Pumatech nor the Surviving
Corporation shall have any liability under Section 10.2 and the Synchrologic
Indemnified Parties may not receive any indemnification or reimbursement of
Damages unless and until an Agents Certificate or Certificates (as defined
in Section 10.6 below) for an aggregate amount of Damages suffered by the
Synchrologic Indemnified Parties in excess of the Damages Threshold have been
delivered to Pumatech; _provided_ , _however_ , that after an Agents
Certificate or Certificates for an aggregate amount exceeding the Damages
Threshold has been delivered, the Synchrologic Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled (subject to the provisions of this Article X) to receive
indemnification or reimbursement in cash equal to the full amount of Damages
identified in such Agents Certificate or Certificates.



 Section 10.5 _ Escrow Periods_. The Escrow Fund and the indemnification
obligations set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall terminate upon the first
anniversary date of the Closing Date (the period from the Closing Date to the
first anniversary of the Closing Date referred to as the "Escrow Period"),
_provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the number of Escrow Shares, which, in the
reasonable and good faith judgment of Pumatech, subject to the objection of
the Shareholders Agent and the subsequent resolution of the matter in the
manner provided in Section 10.9, are necessary to satisfy any unsatisfied
claims specified in any Officers Certificate theretofore delivered to the
Escrow Agent and the Shareholders Agent prior to termination of the Escrow
Period with respect to Damages incurred or litigation pending prior to
expiration of the Escrow Period, shall remain in the Escrow Fund until such
claims have been finally resolved, and (b) the Synchrologic Indemnified
Parties shall continue to be entitled to indemnification by Pumatech and the
Surviving Corporation in such amount as may be necessary to satisfy any
unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate theretofore
delivered to Pumatech prior to termination of the Escrow Period with respect
to Damages incurred or litigation pending prior to the expiration of the
Escrow Period, and such amounts shall remain readily available for
reimbursement to the Synchrologic Indemnified Parties and shall remain free of
encumbrances until such claims have been finally resolved.



 Section 10.6 _ Claims Procedures_. If the Escrow Agent receives, on or
before the last day of the Escrow Period, a certificate signed by any
appropriately authorized officer of Pumatech (an "Officers Certificate"), in
the case of claims made by the Pumatech Indemnified Parties, or if Pumatech
receives, on or before the last day  



 

A-48 ##### Table of Contents

   

 of the Escrow Period, a certificate signed by the Shareholders Agent, in
the case of claims made by the Synchrologic Indemnified Parties (an "Agents
Certificate"):



(a) Stating the aggregate amount of Damages or an estimate thereof, in each
case to the extent known or determinable at such time; and



(b) Specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of such Damages
included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or
properly accrued or arose, and the nature of the misrepresentation, breach or
claim to which such item is related, (i) in the case of claims made by the
Pumatech Indemnified Parties, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the
provisions of Sections 10.4, 10.7, 10.8 (including, without limitation, the
objection period specified therein) and 10.9 hereof and of the Escrow
Agreement, deliver to Pumatech out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as
practicable following the expiration of the Escrow Period, Escrow Shares
having a value equal to such Damages all in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement and Sections 10.7, 10.8 and 10.9 below (with all amounts paid or
distributed from the Escrow Fund being paid or distributed pro rata among the
Holders (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) based upon their respective
percentage interests therein at the time), and (ii) in the case of claims made
by the Synchrologic Indemnified Parties, Pumatech and the Surviving
Corporation shall deliver to the Synchrologic Indemnified Parties, as
promptly as practicable following the expiration of the Escrow Period, a cash
amount in readily available funds equal to such Damages all in accordance with
Sections 10.7, 10.8 (including, without limitation, the objection period
specified therein) and 10.9 below.



 Section 10.7 _ Valuation_. For the purpose of compensating the
Indemnified Parties for their Damages pursuant to this Agreement, the value
per share of the Escrow Shares which shall be released to the Pumatech
Indemnified Parties in respect of a claim for Damages shall be the Average
Closing Price.



 Section 10.8 _ Objections to Claims_.



(a) With respect to claims for Damages made by a Pumatech Indemnified Party,
at the time of delivery of any Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a
duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate shall concurrently be delivered
to the Shareholders Agent (as defined in Section 10.10 below) and for a
period of at least thirty (30) days after such delivery, the Escrow Agent
shall make no delivery of Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 10.5 or 10.6, as
applicable, unless the Escrow Agent shall have received written authorization
from the Shareholders Agent to make such delivery. After the later of (i)
the expiration of the Escrow Period or (ii) the expiration of such minimum
thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent shall make delivery of the Escrow
Shares in the Escrow Fund in accordance with Section 10.6. If the
Shareholders Agent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in
the Officers Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent and to Pumatech prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day
period following delivery of the Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent
and the Shareholders Agent, the disputed claim shall be resolved pursuant to
Section 10.9 hereof.



 

(b) With respect to claims for Damages made by a Synchrologic Indemnified
Party, after the later of (i) the expiration of the Escrow Period or (ii) the
expiration of thirty (30) days following delivery of any Agents Certificate
to Pumatech, Pumatech shall reimburse the Damages in accordance with Section
10.6. If Pumatech shall object in a written statement to the claim made in
the Agents Certificate, and such statement shall have been delivered to the
Shareholders Agent prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period
following delivery of the Agents Certificate to Pumatech, the disputed claim
shall be resolved pursuant to Section 10.9 hereof.



 Section 10.9 _ Resolution of Conflicts_.



(a) In case the Shareholders Agent or Pumatech shall so object in writing to
any claim or claims by Pumatech made in any Officers Certificate or by any
Synchrologic Indemnified Party made in any Agents Certificate, Pumatech or
the Shareholders Agent, as applicable, shall have thirty (30) days following
the expiration of the Escrow Period to respond in a written statement to such
objection. If after such thirty (30) day period there remains a dispute as to
any claims, the Shareholders Agent and Pumatech shall attempt in  



 

A-49 ##### Table of Contents

   

 good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Shareholders Agent
and Pumatech should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall
be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of claims against the
Escrow Fund, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. In the case of claims by
a Pumatech Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and shall distribute the Escrow Shares from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms of the memorandum. In the case of claims by
a Synchrologic Indemnified Party, Pumatech shall pay or cause to be paid the
agreed amount of such claim within two (2) business days of the parties
execution of the memorandum.



(b) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Pumatech or the Shareholders Agent may, by written notice to the other,
demand arbitration of the matter. The parties agree that all disputed claims
for Damages shall be resolved in a single arbitration commenced promptly
following the date the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section
10.9(a) above have been exhausted, unless the amount of the damage or loss is
at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree
to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after the
date the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 10.9(a) above have
been exhausted, Pumatech (on the one hand) and the Shareholders Agent (on
the other hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so
selected shall select a third arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as
to the validity and amount of any claim in such Officers Certificate or
Agents Certificate, as applicable, shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 10.5, the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such decision and
make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance with such
decision.



(c) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Wilmington,
Delaware under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own
expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American
Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including, without limitation, the
reasonable attorneys fees and costs, incurred by the prevailing party to the
arbitration.



 Section 10.10 _ Shareholders Agent_.



(a) In the event that the Merger is approved by the shareholders of
Synchrologic, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any
stockholder of Synchrologic, Grotech Advisory Services, Inc. shall be
appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "Shareholders Agent") for each
stockholder of Synchrologic (except such shareholders of Synchrologic, if
any, as shall have perfected their appraisal or dissenters rights under
Georgia Law). The Shareholders Agent shall have the authority to act for and
on behalf of the Former Synchrologic Shareholders, including,
without limitation, to give and receive notices and communications, to act on
behalf of the Former Synchrologic Shareholders with respect to any matters
arising under this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, to authorize
delivery to Pumatech of the Escrow Shares or other property, including shares
of Pumatech Common Stock, from the Escrow Fund, and any other funds and
property in its possession in satisfaction of claims by Pumatech, to object to
such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and commence, prosecute, participate in, settle, dismiss or
otherwise terminate, as applicable, lawsuits and claims, mediation and
arbitration proceedings, and to comply with orders of courts and awards
of courts, mediators and arbitrators with respect to such suits, claims or
proceedings, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment
of the Shareholders Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Shareholders Agent shall for all purposes be deemed the sole authorized
agent of the Former Synchrologic Shareholders until such time as the agency is
terminated. Such agency may be changed by the Former Synchrologic Shareholders
from time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to
Pumatech; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Shareholders Agent may not be
removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest in the Escrow Fund agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted Shareholders Agent. Any
vacancy in the position of Shareholders Agent may be filled by  



 

A-50 ##### Table of Contents

   

 approval of the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No
bond shall be required of the Shareholders Agent, and the
Shareholders Agent shall not receive compensation for its services. Notices
or communications to or from the Shareholders Agent shall constitute notice
to or from each of the Former Synchrologic Shareholders during the term of the
agency.



(b) The Shareholders Agent shall not incur any liability with respect to
any action taken or suffered by it or omitted hereunder as Shareholders
Agent. The Shareholders Agent may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely
on the advice of counsel and other professionals and for anything done,
omitted or suffered by the Shareholders Agent based on such advice and the
Shareholders Agent shall not be liable to anyone. The Shareholders Agent
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement and no other covenants or obligations shall be
implied under this Agreement against the Shareholders Agent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not act as a limitation on the powers of
the Shareholders Agent determined by it to be reasonably necessary to carry
out the purposes of its obligations. The Former Synchrologic Shareholders
shall severally and pro rata, in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Portions, indemnify the Shareholders Agent and hold him or her harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred on the part of the
Shareholders Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his or her duties under this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement.



(c) The Shareholders Agent shall have reasonable access to information about
Synchrologic and Pumatech and the reasonable assistance of Synchrologics and
Pumatechs officers and employees for purposes of performing its duties and
exercising its rights hereunder, provided that the Shareholders Agent shall
treat confidentially and not disclose any nonpublic information from or about
Synchrologic or Pumatech to anyone (except on a need to know basis to
individuals who agree to treat such information confidentially).



(d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholders Agent shall
constitute a decision, act, consent or instruction of all of the Former
Synchrologic Shareholders for whom shares of Pumatech Common Stock otherwise
issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each such Former Synchrologic Stockholder, and the Escrow
Agent. Pumatech may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Shareholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of every such stockholder of Synchrologic. The Escrow Agent and Pumatech are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholders Agent.



(e) The Shareholders Agent shall be reimbursed for any fees or expenses
payable or incurred by the Shareholders Agent in connection with the Merger
Agreement or any claim for indemnification under the Merger Agreement
(including any disputes with respect to such claims) and any loss, liability
or expense of the Shareholders Agent that is subject to the indemnification
obligations of the Former Synchrologic Shareholders pursuant to Section
10.10(b) hereof, up to an aggregate amount of $500,000, and such fees and
expenses shall be payable to the Shareholders Agent by the delivery of the
number of Escrow Shares having a value, based on the Average Closing Price,
equal to the amount of such fees, losses, liabilities or expenses, and such
delivery shall rank senior to the delivery of any Escrow Shares to
the Pumatech Indemnified Parties. Any such fees, losses, liabilities or
expenses in excess of $500,000 shall be payable to the Shareholders Agent
directly by the Former Synchrologic Shareholders in accordance with the
provisions of Sections 10.9(c) and 10.10(b) hereof.



 Section 10.11 _ Claims_.



(a) In the event Pumatech becomes aware of a third-party claim which Pumatech
believes may result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Pumatech shall
promptly notify the Shareholders Agent of such claim, and the Shareholders
Agent and the Former Synchrologic Shareholders for whom shares of Pumatech
Common Stock otherwise issuable to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund shall
be entitled, at their expense, to participate in any defense of such claim.
Pumatech shall have the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Pumatech may not effect the settlement of any
such claim  



 

A-51 ##### Table of Contents

   

 without the written consent of the Shareholders Agent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. In the event that the Shareholders Agent has
consented in writing to any such settlement, the Shareholders Agent shall
have no power or authority to object to the amount of any claim by Pumatech
against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement in the
amount agreed to.



(b) In the event the Shareholders Agent becomes aware of a third-party
claim which the Shareholders Agent or any Synchrologic Indemnified Party
believes may result in Damages indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2, the
Shareholders Agent shall promptly notify Pumatech of such claim, and
Pumatech or the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. The Shareholders Agent shall have
the right in its sole discretion to settle any such claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Shareholders Agent may not effect the settlement of any
such claim without the written consent of Pumatech or the Surviving
Corporation, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
