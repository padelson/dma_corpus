approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Merger Sub to commence
(within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Exchange Act) an offer (as it may be amended from time
to time as permitted under this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to purchase for cash all of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $.01 per share (the
&#147;<U>Common Stock</U>&#148;), at a price of $105.00 per share (such price, or any higher price per share
of Common Stock paid by Merger Sub pursuant to the terms of the Offer for shares of Common Stock
tendered pursuant to the Offer, the &#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged

the Special Committee, has (i)&nbsp;determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other

covenants and agreements contained herein, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;1.1 <U>The Offer</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section&nbsp;9.1
and no event set forth in paragraphs (a)&nbsp;through (h)&nbsp;in Annex A hereto shall have occurred and be
continuing, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of
Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and
in any event no later than January&nbsp;18, 2008. The Offer Price shall be net to the seller of shares
of Common Stock in the Offer in cash, without interest, subject to reduction for applicable amounts
withheld pursuant to paragraph&nbsp;(f) below. The Company agrees that no shares of Common Stock held
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered pursuant to the Offer. The obligation
of Merger Sub to accept for payment and to pay for any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject only to those conditions set forth in Annex&nbsp;A hereto (as they may be
amended in accordance with this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Offer Conditions</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive any of the Offer
Conditions and make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer, <I>provided that</I>,
without the prior written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i)&nbsp;decrease the Offer Price
or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii)&nbsp;decrease the number of shares of
Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii)&nbsp;amend the number of shares of Common Stock
required to satisfy the Minimum Condition except in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.2(e) hereof or waive

Documents</U>&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of Common
Stock as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company agrees to furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by applicable Law to be set forth in the
Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary
to cause the Schedule&nbsp;TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of Common Stock, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities laws. Parent will provide the
Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents, and any amendments
thereto, before they are filed with the SEC or disseminated to the holders of Common Stock. Parent
and Merger Sub shall respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from
the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents and provide copies of such comments to the Company
promptly upon receipt and copies of proposed responses to the Company a reasonable time prior to
filing or disseminating to allow meaningful comment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;The Offer shall remain open until that date that is twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days following
(and including the day of) the commencement of the Offer (such date, or such subsequent date to
which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the &#147;<U>Expiration Date</U>&#148;). Unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with Section&nbsp;9.1, if at any scheduled Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions shall not have
been satisfied or earlier waived by Merger Sub, or, even if all of the Offer Conditions shall have
been satisfied or waived, if the Financing Documentation Deadline shall not have occurred, then
Merger Sub shall extend the Offer and the Expiration Date on one or more occasions for periods of
up to twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days as Merger Sub shall determine; <I>provided, however</I>, that (i)&nbsp;if all
of the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived by Merger Sub for at least ten (10)&nbsp;Business
Days other than the Minimum Condition, then Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the
Expiration Date beyond the four (4)&nbsp;month anniversary of the day of the commencement of the Offer
and (ii)&nbsp;in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer or the Expiration Date beyond
the Outside Date. Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, elect to provide a subsequent offering
period for the Offer in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act
(&#147;<U>Subsequent Offering Period</U>&#148;) if as of the commencement of the Subsequent Offering Period,
there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number of
shares of Common Stock necessary to permit the Merger to be effected without a meeting of
stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section&nbsp;253 of the Act. Nothing contained in this
Section&nbsp;1.1(d) shall be construed to affect any termination rights set forth in Article&nbsp;IX hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(e)&nbsp;Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver by
Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date, following the occurrence of the
Financing Documentation Deadline and in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-11, Merger Sub shall (i)&nbsp;accept
for payment (&#147;<U>Acceptance</U>&#148; and the time and date of such Acceptance, the &#147;<U>Acceptance
Date</U>&#148;) and pay for shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date and (ii)&nbsp;as promptly as practicable, accept for
payment and pay for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered into any Subsequent Offering
Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(f)&nbsp;Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Common Stock such amounts as Merger Sub is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate Tax authority by Merger Sub, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of the Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding were made by Merger Sub.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any next scheduled Expiration Date
without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section&nbsp;9.1.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;1.2 <U>Company Action</U>.

any amendments or supplements thereto, and including the exhibits thereto, the
&#147;<U>Schedule&nbsp;14D-9</U>&#148;) reflecting, subject to the provisions of Section&nbsp;7.4(e), the

to holders of the Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law.
Subject to Section&nbsp;7.4(e), the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 will set forth, and the Company hereby represents,

contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders (other than Affiliates of Parent), (ii)&nbsp;approved the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with applicable Law,
(iii)&nbsp;resolved to recommend that the holders of Common Stock accept the Offer, tender their shares

discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Company Schedule&nbsp;13E-3 or the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9, so that the Company Schedule&nbsp;13E-3
or the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party which

Offer and the deposit of funds sufficient to fund such payment with the depositary for the Offer
(the &#147;<U>Director Effective Time</U>&#148;), Parent shall be entitled to designate all but one of the
directors to the Company Board of Directors and all of the directors of each Subsidiary of the
Company and Company Joint Venture (or, in the case of Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures as to
which the Company is entitled to appoint less than all of the directors pursuant to contractual
arrangements with third parties, then such number of directors as the Company is entitled to
appoint), and the Company shall take all actions necessary to cause Parent&#146;s designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board of Directors including using its commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain resignations from incumbent directors, provided however that the Remaining
Director (as defined below) shall not be required to resign from the Company Board of Directors and
shall not be removed from the Company Board of Directors until the Effective Time, until which time
such Remaining Director shall be constituted as a one-person committee of the Company Board of
Directors with the authority to act as expressly provided in this Agreement. The &#147;<U>Remaining
Director</U>&#148; means one of the members of the Company Board of Directors serving as a member of the
Special Committee as of the date of this Agreement chosen in the following manner: the Special
Committee shall propose two of such directors as candidates to serve as the Remaining Director and
Parent shall choose one of the two proposed directors, which director shall be the Remaining
Director. Immediately following the Director Effective Time, subject to the provisions of the
previous sentence, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause individuals designated by
Parent to constitute (i)&nbsp;a majority of each committee (other than the Special Committee, which
shall be terminated as of the Director Effective Time) of the Company Board of Directors and (ii)
all members of each board of directors (and each committee thereof) of each Subsidiary of the
Company and Company Joint Venture (or, in the case of Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures as to
which the Company is entitled to appoint less than all of the directors pursuant to contractual
arrangements with third parties, then such number of directors as the Company is entitled to
appoint), in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;The Company&#146;s obligations to appoint Parent&#146;s designees to the Board of Directors of the
Company shall be subject to Section&nbsp;14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule&nbsp;14f-1 thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to such Section&nbsp;and Rule&nbsp;in order to
fulfill its obligations under this Section&nbsp;1.3, including the mailing to the holders of Common
Stock of an information statement containing the information required by such Section&nbsp;and Rule, as
promptly as practicable following the mailing of the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 (or together with the
Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 if Parent has then provided the required information) and shall include in such
information statement all information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as
is required under such Section&nbsp;and Rule&nbsp;in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section&nbsp;1.3.
Parent will supply to the Company any information with respect to itself and its officers,
directors and Affiliates required by such Section&nbsp;and Rule.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;Following the election or appointment of Parent&#146;s designees pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.3(a) and
until the Effective Time, the approval of the Remaining Director shall be required to authorize
(and such authorization shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, constitute the
authorization of the Company Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the Company,
including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be required to authorize) any
termination of this Agreement by the Company, any amendment of this Agreement, including any
decrease in or change of form of the Merger Consideration, any extension of time for performance of
any obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, and any amendment or
change to Section&nbsp;7.5. Following the election or appointment of Parent&#146;s designees pursuant to
Section&nbsp;1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement of this
Agreement by the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be effected only
by the action of the Remaining Director; provided, however that the initiation of any Proceeding
shall require approval of both the Remaining Director and a majority of the entire Company Board of
Directors, unless such Proceeding is brought in response to a stockholder demand, in which event
initiation of such Proceeding shall require approval of only the Remaining Director. If requested
by the Remaining Director, a committee of the Company Board of Directors which shall include the
Remaining Director and one or more independent outside directors shall be constituted, to consider
and approve the initiation of any Proceeding.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;1.4 <U>Top-Up Option</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Immediately following Acceptance, the Company shall grant to Merger Sub an irrevocable
option (the &#147;<U>Top-Up Option</U>&#148;) to purchase, at a price per share equal to the Offer Price, a
number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (the &#147;<U>Top-Up Option Shares</U>&#148;) that, when added
to the number of shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub at
the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Common Stock more than 90% of
the number of shares of Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time on or
after any Expiration Date hereunder and on or prior to the fifth (5<sup>th</sup>) Business Day
after the Expiration Date or the expiration date of any subsequent offering period; <I>provided,
however</I>, that the obligation of the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of
the Top-Up Option is subject to the conditions that (A)&nbsp;prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option,
Parent and Merger Sub own at least 80% of the total number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding, (B)&nbsp;no provision of any applicable Law and no Restraint shall prohibit the exercise of
the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (C)&nbsp;the
issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require approval of the
Company&#146;s stockholders under the Act or any rule or regulation of the Nasdaq Global Select Market
and would not obligate the Company to issue or deliver any Company Securities pursuant to
preemptive rights provisions contained in any agreement to which the Company is a party, (D)&nbsp;upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly,
by Parent or Merger Sub constitutes one share of Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares
of Common Stock that will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares, (E)&nbsp;the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall in no
event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock not otherwise reserved
for issuance for outstanding Company Equity Awards or other obligations of the Company and (F)&nbsp;the
Acceptance shall have occurred.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the shares of Common Stock which Merger Sub may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the 1933 Act and will be
issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering.
Parent and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or will be upon the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an &#147;accredited investor&#148;, as defined in Rule&nbsp;501 of
Regulation&nbsp;D under the 1933 Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option
Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the 1933 Act) in violation of the 1933 Act. The
parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished
consistent with all applicable Laws, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with Section&nbsp;1.4(a), Merger Sub shall
so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (i)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common Stock
that will be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately preceding the
purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii)&nbsp;a place and time for the closing of the purchase of
the Top-Up Option Shares.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt of such
notice, notify Merger Sub of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and the number
of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub
shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares, which
shall equal the Offer Price multiplied by the number of Top-Up Option Shares, and the Company shall
cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The
aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid by Merger Sub by payment of
cash, executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Shares or a combination thereof as
Parent shall determine. Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 7% per annum,
shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note
and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
after the Top-Up Option is exercised and prior to the Effective Time, all amounts then owing
pursuant to the promissory note (including all interest) shall thereupon become immediately due and
payable and, at the election of Parent, the Top-Up Shares may be returned to the Company in full
satisfaction of the amount owed on the promissory note.

Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent to which Merger Sub&#146;s rights and
obligations are assigned pursuant to Section&nbsp;10.6 immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any,
shall be, by virtue of the Merger, canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment of
consideration or distribution shall be made or delivered with respect thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;Each Merger Sub Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be converted into and become one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,

to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such share of Common
Stock (a &#147;<U>Certificate</U>&#148;) in the manner provided in Section&nbsp;2.4. Such shares of Common Stock
(including any Company Restricted Shares), other than those canceled pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.2(a),
sometimes are referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Merger Shares</U>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of shares of
outstanding Common Stock is changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the Offer Price
(with respect to any such event that becomes effective prior to the Expiration Date) and the Merger
Consideration payable per share of Common Stock shall be correspondingly adjusted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(e)&nbsp;The Company Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated as provided in Section&nbsp;2.5.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;2.3 <U>Dissenting Shares</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that are held by a holder who was entitled to and has validly demanded appraisal rights in
accordance with Section&nbsp;262 of the Act (&#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holder&#146;s appraisal rights under the Act,
but instead shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the Act. If any such holder shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal right pursuant to the
Act, each Dissenting Share of such holder shall be treated as a share of Common Stock that had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section&nbsp;2.2(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Act received by the
Company for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to serve as the disbursing agent for the Merger Consideration and
payments in respect of the Vested Company Equity Awards, unless another agent is designated as
provided in Section&nbsp;2.5(a) (the &#147;<U>Disbursing Agent</U>&#148;). Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent will cause to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent (or such other agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to the Effective Time) cash in the
aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time plus any cash necessary to pay for Vested
Company Equity Awards and Company Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.5. Such funds may be invested by the Disbursing Agent as directed by
Parent or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation; provided, that such investments
shall be in: (i)&nbsp;obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or (ii)&nbsp;money market
accounts, certificates of deposit or demand deposits with commercial banks having assets in excess
of $100,000,000,000. Any profit or loss resulting from, or interest and other income produced by,
such investments shall be for the account of Parent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event no more than seven
(7)&nbsp;Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Disbursing
Agent to mail, to each record holder of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
a letter of transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the Merger
Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will
specify that delivery of Certificates will be effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates and a duly executed letter of transmittal to the Disbursing
Agent. Upon surrender of such Certificate or Certificates to the Disbursing Agent together with a
properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal and any other documentation that the
Disbursing Agent may reasonably require pursuant to the instructions, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor, without
interest and the Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged,
each such Certificate shall, after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall be paid to
the holder of such outstanding Certificate in respect thereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of the Merger Shares
formerly represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall
be a condition to such payment that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable stock transfer taxes required as a result
of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to
the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such stock transfer taxes have been paid or are
not payable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(d)&nbsp;After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Disbursing Agent, such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article&nbsp;II.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(e)&nbsp;If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed nine months after the
Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and
any holder who has not surrendered such holder&#146;s Certificates for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of
Certificates for an amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed property
laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to
such time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(f)&nbsp;From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Stock, other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(g)&nbsp;In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, upon the posting by such
holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation or the
Disbursing Agent with respect to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect thereof entitled to
be received pursuant to this Agreement.

withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable hereunder any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so deducted and
withheld, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder from whose Merger Consideration the amounts were so deducted and
withheld.

2005 Stock Appreciation Rights Bonus Plan) (&#147;<U>Company Equity Award</U>&#148;) which is vested and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (&#147;<U>Vested Company Equity Award</U>&#148;)
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Equity Award multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the
excess, if any, of (x)&nbsp;the Merger Consideration over (y)&nbsp;the exercise or the strike price of the
Vested Company Equity Award, as the case may be (as adjusted on any vesting date pursuant to its
terms or an applicable Company Benefit Plan with respect to all or any portion of the shares
covered thereby), without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under
any applicable Law except that with respect to any stock appreciation right that has been frozen by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be $53.80. In
the event that the per share exercise or strike price of any Vested Company Equity Award, as
adjusted, is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Equity Award
shall be canceled without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect. All payments
with respect to such Vested Company Equity Awards shall be made by the Disbursing Agent (or such
other agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to the Effective
Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at
the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.4.

which award shall be deemed a Vested Company Equity Award) shall be converted into the right to
receive an amount in cash on each of the applicable vesting dates and subject to the other terms
and conditions applicable to such Unvested Company Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the portion of
such Unvested Company Equity Award which becomes vested on such date multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the excess,

an applicable Company Benefit Plan with respect to all or any portion of the shares covered
thereby), without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Law except that with respect to any stock appreciation right that has been frozen by the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be $53.80. In the
event that the per share exercise or strike price of any Unvested Company Equity Award, as
adjusted, is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Unvested Company Equity Award
shall be canceled without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the applicable amounts which become due under
this Section&nbsp;2.5(b) as soon as reasonably practicable following the applicable vesting date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(c)&nbsp;Each outstanding Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall vest and become free of restrictions as of the Effective Time and be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
2.2, without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Law. All payments with respect to such Company Restricted Shares shall be made by the
Disbursing Agent (or such other agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall

Equity Awards and Company Restricted Shares amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.2 <U>Survival of Representations and Warranties</U>. None of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time, except for those covenants and agreements
contained herein and therein which by their terms apply in whole or in part after the Effective
Time and then only to such extent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.3 <U>Expenses</U>. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section&nbsp;9.2, all costs
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
cost or expense.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.4 <U>Amendment</U>. This Agreement may be amended by written agreement of all of the
parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors (in the case
of the Company, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, (x)&nbsp;acting through the Special Committee if
such action is taken before the Acceptance Date and (y)&nbsp;acting through the Remaining Director, if
such action is taken on or after the Acceptance Date, so long as the Remaining Director is serving
on the Company Board of Directors) at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
approval of this Agreement by the Company stockholders; provided, however, that, after the
Acceptance Date but prior to approval of this Agreement by the Company stockholders, this Agreement
may not be amended in a manner that would adversely affect the right of the Company&#146;s stockholders
to receive the Merger Consideration; and, provided, further, that, after approval of this Agreement
by the Company stockholders, no amendment may be made which under applicable Law requires the
further approval of the stockholders of the Company without such further approval. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.5 <U>Waiver</U>. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may
(i)&nbsp;extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other

or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii)&nbsp;subject to the requirements of applicable
Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in

upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns,
provided that no party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement without the consent of the other parties hereto (and any purported assignment

to modify the terms of this Agreement to reflect such assignment or removal.

accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.8 <U>Counterparts; Third Party Beneficiaries</U>. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile signatures and in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with
the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. No
provision of this Agreement is intended to nor shall it confer upon any Person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder or with respect hereto, except as otherwise
expressly provided in Section&nbsp;7.5.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.9 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by virtue of any Law, or due to any public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so
long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely
as possible in an acceptable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.10 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement, together with the <U>Company Disclosure
Letter</U> and the Parent Disclosure Letter, constitute the entire agreement of the parties hereto
with respect to its subject matter and supersedes all oral or written prior or contemporaneous
agreements and understandings among the parties with respect to such subject matter. None of the
parties shall be liable or bound to any other party in any manner by any representations,
warranties or covenants relating to such subject matter hereof except as specifically set forth
herein, in the <U>Company Disclosure Letter</U> or the Parent Disclosure Letter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.11 <U>Jurisdiction</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(a)&nbsp;Each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of (i)&nbsp;the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware, and (ii)&nbsp;in the event that exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is vested in
such court under applicable Law, any Federal court of the United States sitting in the State of
Delaware, solely for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding between any of the
parties hereto arising out of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby. Each party
agrees to commence any suit, action or proceeding relating hereto in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, in the event that exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is vested in such
court under applicable Law, any Federal court of the United States sitting in the State of
Delaware. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue
of any suit, action or proceeding between any of the parties hereto arising out of this Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby in (i)&nbsp;the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, and
(ii)&nbsp;in the event that exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is vested in such court under
applicable Law, any Federal court of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware, and hereby
further irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any
of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by registered mail to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such service
of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail; provided that
nothing in this Section&nbsp;10.11 shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section&nbsp;10.11 shall
not constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have no
effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section&nbsp;10.11. The parties agree that a final
judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(b)&nbsp;EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.12 <U>Authorship</U>. The parties agree that the terms and language of this Agreement
were the result of negotiations between the parties and their respective advisors and, as a result,
there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any
party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to
events of authorship or negotiation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">Section&nbsp;10.13 <U>Remedies of Parent and Merger Sub</U>. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur to Parent and Merger
Sub, damages would be difficult to determine and would be an insufficient remedy and no other
adequate remedy would exist at law or in equity, in each case in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their specific
terms or were otherwise breached by the Company (or the Company threatens such a breach). It is
accordingly agreed that in the event of a breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement against the Company, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity and it is further agreed that no bond shall be required to be posted by Parent or
Merger Sub in connection with the issuance of any injunctive relief. The Company irrevocably
waives any defenses based on adequacy of any other remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might
be asserted as a bar to the remedy of specific performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof
or injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by Parent or Merger Sub. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company or any person acting on behalf of, or claiming rights through,
the Company be entitled to seek specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief
to enforce any obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or any other Person under
any other agreement or arrangement relating to or arising from the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to
enforce the Confidentiality Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, but only to the extent and in
the circumstances that such agreements specifically provide for such relief.
