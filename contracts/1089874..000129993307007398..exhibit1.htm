AGREEMENT    

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, intending to be
legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I    

THE TENDER OFFER    

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.   

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with Section 9.1 and no event set forth in paragraphs (a) through (h) in
Annex A hereto shall have occurred and be continuing, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, and in any event no later than January 18, 2008. The Offer Price
shall be net to the seller of shares of Common Stock in the Offer in cash,
without interest, subject to reduction for applicable amounts withheld
pursuant to paragraph (f) below. The Company agrees that no shares of Common
Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and
to pay for any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be
subject only to those conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (as they may
be amended in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_
").   

(b) Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive
any of the Offer Conditions and make any other changes in the terms and
conditions of the Offer, _provided that_ , without the prior written consent
of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price or change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of
shares of Common Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend the
number of shares of Common Stock required to satisfy the Minimum Condition
except in accordance with Section 7.2(e) hereof or waive satisfaction of the
Minimum Condition, (iv) impose additional conditions on the Offer or (v)
amend any other term of the Offer in any manner adverse in any material
respect to the holders of shares of Common Stock.   

(c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i)
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a combined Schedule 13E-3 and Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed under cover of Schedule TO (together
with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") and
related offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and summary advertisement
and other ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the
Offer will be made (collectively, and including any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the holders of Common Stock as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. The Company agrees to furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all
information concerning the Company required by applicable Law to be set forth
in the Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees
promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and Merger Sub shall take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the
SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be
disseminated to holders of Common Stock, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable Federal securities laws. Parent will provide
the Company a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer
Documents, and any amendments thereto, before they are filed with the SEC or
disseminated to the holders of Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received
from the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents and provide copies of such
comments to the Company promptly upon receipt and copies of proposed
responses to the Company a reasonable time prior to filing or disseminating
to allow meaningful comment.   

(d) The Offer shall remain open until that date that is twenty (20) Business
Days following (and including the day of) the commencement of the Offer (such
date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is
extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
" _Expiration Date_ "). Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with Section 9.1, if at any scheduled Expiration Date, any of the
Offer Conditions shall not have been satisfied or earlier waived by Merger
Sub, or, even if all of the Offer Conditions shall have been satisfied or
waived, if the Financing Documentation Deadline shall not have occurred,
then Merger Sub shall extend the Offer and the Expiration Date on one or more
occasions for periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days as Merger Sub shall
determine; _provided, however_ , that (i) if all of the Offer Conditions have
been satisfied or waived by Merger Sub for at least ten (10) Business Days
other than the Minimum Condition, then Merger Sub shall not be required to
extend the Expiration Date beyond the four (4) month anniversary of the day
of the commencement of the Offer and (ii) in no event shall Merger Sub be
required to extend the Offer or the Expiration Date beyond the Outside Date.
Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, elect to provide a subsequent
offering period for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 promulgated
under the Exchange Act (" _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") if as of the
commencement of the Subsequent Offering Period, there shall not have been
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that number
of shares of Common Stock necessary to permit the Merger to be effected
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with Section
253 of the Act. Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(d) shall be construed
to affect any termination rights set forth in Article IX hereof.   

(e) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction
or waiver by Merger Sub of the Offer Conditions as of the Expiration Date,
following the occurrence of the Financing Documentation Deadline and in
accordance with Rule 14d-11, Merger Sub shall (i) accept for payment ("
_Acceptance_ " and the time and date of such Acceptance, the "
_Acceptance Date_ ") and pay for shares of Common Stock validly tendered and
not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration
Date and (ii) as promptly as practicable, accept for payment and pay for all
shares of Common Stock validly tendered into any Subsequent
Offering Period.   

(f) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Common
Stock such amounts as Merger Sub is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority by Merger Sub, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of the Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made by Merger Sub.   

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any next scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company except in
the event the Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 9.1.   

Section 1.2 _Company Action_.   

(a) The Company shall, after affording Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable on the date of the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer
Documents, a Schedule 13E-3 (the " _Company Schedule 13E-3_") and a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, and including the exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_") reflecting, subject to the provisions of Section 7.4(e),
the recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that holders of
shares of Common Stock tender their shares of Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to holders of the Common
Stock, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. Subject
to Section 7.4(e), the Schedule 14D-9 will set forth, and the Company hereby
represents, that the Board of Directors of the Company, acting upon the
unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, at a duly held meeting has
(i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and fair to and in the
best interests of the Company and its stockholders (other than Affiliates of
Parent), (ii) approved the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with applicable Law, (iii)
resolved to recommend that the holders of Common Stock accept the Offer,
tender their shares of Common Stock into the Offer, and approve the Merger
and this Agreement (to the extent such approval is required by applicable Law
for the consummation of the Merger) (such recommendations, together with the
determinations set forth in clause (i), the " _Recommendation_ "), (iv)
directed that the approval of the Merger and this Agreement be submitted for
consideration of the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholder
Meeting (to the extent required by applicable Law) and (v) approved the
acquisition of shares of Common Stock by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
the Offer, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement for purposes of Section 203 of the Act (the " _Takeover Statute_ ")
(such actions by the Board of Directors of the Company described in the
preceding clauses (i) through (v), collectively, the " _Board Actions_ ").
Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly furnish to the Company
in writing all information concerning Parent or Merger Sub that may be
required by applicable securities laws for inclusion in the Company Schedule
13E-3 or Schedule 14D-9. Subject to Section 7.4(e), the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Board Actions. If at
any time prior to the Closing, any information relating to the Offer, the
Merger, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Company Schedule 13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9, so that the Company
Schedule 13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9 shall not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed by the Company with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company, as and to the extent required by applicable Law or any applicable
rule or regulation of any stock exchange. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Company
Schedule 13E-3 and Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments to the Company Schedule
13E-3 and the Schedule 14D-9 before they are filed with the SEC or
disseminated to the holders of Common Stock. The Company shall respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with
respect to the Company Schedule 13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9 and provide
copies of such comments to Parent and Merger Sub promptly upon receipt and
copies of proposed responses to Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable time prior
to filing or disseminating to allow meaningful comment.   

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company will promptly furnish or cause
to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub mailing labels, security position
listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists, and any available listing or
computer list containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the
shares of Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and shall
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available information
(including, without limitation, updated lists of holders of shares of Common
Stock and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists as they become available) and such other
assistance as Parent and Merger Sub and their agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of the Common
Stock in accordance with this Agreement and applicable U.S. federal
securities Laws.   

Section 1.3 _Directors of the Company_.   

(a) Effective upon the acceptance for payment of any shares of Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer and the deposit of funds sufficient to fund such
payment with the depositary for the Offer (the " _Director Effective Time_
"), Parent shall be entitled to designate all but one of the directors to the
Company Board of Directors and all of the directors of each Subsidiary of
the Company and Company Joint Venture (or, in the case of Subsidiaries or
Company Joint Ventures as to which the Company is entitled to appoint less
than all of the directors pursuant to contractual arrangements with third
parties, then such number of directors as the Company is entitled
to appoint), and the Company shall take all actions necessary to cause
ParentÂ’s designees to be elected or appointed to the Company Board of
Directors including using its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain
resignations from incumbent directors, provided however that the
Remaining Director (as defined below) shall not be required to resign from
the Company Board of Directors and shall not be removed from the Company
Board of Directors until the Effective Time, until which time such Remaining
Director shall be constituted as a one-person committee of the Company Board
of Directors with the authority to act as expressly provided in this
Agreement. The " _Remaining Director_ " means one of the members of the
Company Board of Directors serving as a member of the Special Committee as of
the date of this Agreement chosen in the following manner: the
Special Committee shall propose two of such directors as candidates to serve
as the Remaining Director and Parent shall choose one of the two proposed
directors, which director shall be the Remaining Director. Immediately
following the Director Effective Time, subject to the provisions of
the previous sentence, the Company shall take all action necessary to cause
individuals designated by Parent to constitute (i) a majority of each
committee (other than the Special Committee, which shall be terminated as of
the Director Effective Time) of the Company Board of Directors and (ii) all
members of each board of directors (and each committee thereof) of each
Subsidiary of the Company and Company Joint Venture (or, in the case of
Subsidiaries or Company Joint Ventures as to which the Company is entitled to
appoint less than all of the directors pursuant to contractual arrangements
with third parties, then such number of directors as the Company is entitled
to appoint), in each case to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law.   

(b) The CompanyÂ’s obligations to appoint ParentÂ’s designees to the Board of
Directors of the Company shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange
Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3, including the mailing to the holders of
Common Stock of an information statement containing the information required
by such Section and Rule, as promptly as practicable following the mailing of
the Schedule 14D-9 (or together with the Schedule 14D-9 if Parent has then
provided the required information) and shall include in such information
statement all information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors as is required under such Section and Rule in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3. Parent will supply to the Company any
information with respect to itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates
required by such Section and Rule.   

(c) Following the election or appointment of ParentÂ’s designees pursuant to
Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the approval of the Remaining
Director shall be required to authorize (and such authorization shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, constitute the authorization of
the Company Board of Directors and no other action on the part of the
Company, including any action by any other director of the Company, shall be
required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any
amendment of this Agreement, including any decrease in or change of form of
the Merger Consideration, any extension of time for performance of any
obligation or action hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub, any waiver of
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein for the
benefit of the Company, and any amendment or change to Section 7.5. Following
the election or appointment of ParentÂ’s designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a)
and until the Effective Time, any actions with respect to the enforcement of
this Agreement by the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, be effected only by the action of the Remaining Director;
provided, however that the initiation of any Proceeding shall require
approval of both the Remaining Director and a majority of the entire Company
Board of Directors, unless such Proceeding is brought in response to a
stockholder demand, in which event initiation of such Proceeding shall
require approval of only the Remaining Director. If requested by the
Remaining Director, a committee of the Company Board of Directors which shall
include the Remaining Director and one or more independent outside directors
shall be constituted, to consider and approve the initiation of any
Proceeding.   

Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.   

(a) Immediately following Acceptance, the Company shall grant to Merger Sub an
irrevocable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase, at a price per
share equal to the Offer Price, a number of newly issued shares of Common
Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of
shares of Common Stock owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub
at the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Common
Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Common Stock that will be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The
Top-Up Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time on or after
any Expiration Date hereunder and on or prior to the fifth (5th) Business
Day after the Expiration Date or the expiration date of any subsequent
offering period; _provided, however_ , that the obligation of the Company to
deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option is
subject to the conditions that (A) prior to the exercise of the Top-Up
Option, Parent and Merger Sub own at least 80% of the total number of shares
of Common Stock then outstanding, (B) no provision of any applicable Law and
no Restraint shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery
of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (C) the issuance of
Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not require approval
of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders under the Act or any rule or regulation of the
Nasdaq Global Select Market and would not obligate the Company to issue or
deliver any Company Securities pursuant to preemptive rights provisions
contained in any agreement to which the Company is a party, (D) upon exercise
of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Common Stock owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub constitutes one share of Common Stock
more than 90% of the number of shares of Common Stock that will be
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares, (E)
the number of Top-Up Option Shares issued pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall
in no event exceed the number of authorized and unissued shares of Common
Stock not otherwise reserved for issuance for outstanding Company Equity
Awards or other obligations of the Company and (F) the Acceptance shall have
occurred.   

(b) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the shares of Common Stock which
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the 1933 Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited
investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the 1933 Act. Merger
Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for
resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the 1933 Act) in violation of the 1933 Act. The parties shall cooperate to
ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is
accomplished consistent with all applicable Laws, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Option Shares under
the Securities Act.   

(c) Upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option in accordance with Section 1.4(a),
Merger Sub shall so notify the Company and shall set forth in such notice (i)
the number of shares of Common Stock that will be owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the
Top-Up Option Shares and (ii) a place and time for the closing of the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following receipt of such notice, notify Merger Sub of the number of shares
of Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At
the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay
the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option
Shares, which shall equal the Offer Price multiplied by the number of Top-Up
Option Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a
certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase
price payable for the Top-Up Shares may be paid by Merger Sub by payment
of cash, executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the
Top-Up Shares or a combination thereof as Parent shall determine. Any such
promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 7% per annum, shall mature
on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. In the event
that this Agreement is terminated after the Top-Up Option is exercised and
prior to the Effective Time, all amounts then owing pursuant to the
promissory note (including all interest) shall thereupon become immediately
due and payable and, at the election of Parent, the Top-Up Shares may be
returned to the Company in full satisfaction of the amount owed on the
promissory note.   

ARTICLE II    

THE MERGER    

Section 2.1 _The Merger_.   

(a) At the Effective Time, in accordance with the Act, and upon the terms and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, at which
time the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the Surviving Corporation and, immediately after the Effective
Time, a Subsidiary of Parent or VimpelCom.   

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, on the Closing Date, the
Company and/or Merger Sub, as appropriate, shall file a Certificate of Merger
or Certificate of Ownership and Merger, as applicable (in either case, the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), meeting the requirements of the Act for
acceptance of record by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such later
time as the Company and Merger Sub may agree and specify in the Certificate
of Merger (such time as the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_
").   

(c) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, all
property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and
authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties
of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   

(d) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the
offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP located in New York, New York,
as soon as reasonably practicable (but in any event, no later than the second
Business Day) after the day on which the last condition to the Merger set
forth in Article VIII is satisfied or validly waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but subject to the satisfaction or valid waiver of such conditions) or (ii)
at such other place and time or on such other date as the Company and Parent
may agree in writing (the actual date of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_
").   

Section 2.2 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, pursuant to
this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of Common Stock:   

(a) Each share of Common Stock owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Parent or Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent to which Merger SubÂ’s rights and obligations are assigned pursuant to
Section 10.6 immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be, by
virtue of the Merger, canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
payment of consideration or distribution shall be made or delivered with
respect thereto.   

(b) Each Merger Sub Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.   

(c) Each share of Common Stock (including any Company Restricted Shares)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(a)),
automatically shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive the
Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable to the holder thereof upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such share of Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") in the manner
provided in Section 2.4. Such shares of Common Stock (including any Company
Restricted Shares), other than those canceled pursuant to Section
2.2(a), sometimes are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_."   

(d) If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of
shares of outstanding Common Stock is changed into a different number of
shares or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or the like, other than pursuant to the Merger, the Offer Price (with respect
to any such event that becomes effective prior to the Expiration Date) and the
Merger Consideration payable per share of Common Stock shall be
correspondingly adjusted.   

(e) The Company Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be treated as provided in Section 2.5.   

Section 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who was
entitled to and has validly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of the Act (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such holderÂ’s appraisal rights under the Act, but instead shall be
converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
Act. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal right pursuant to the Act, each
Dissenting Share of such holder shall be treated as a share of Common Stock
that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2(c). The Company shall
give prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the Act received by
the Company for appraisal of shares of Common Stock, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.   

Section 2.4 _Payment of Cash for Merger Shares_.   

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to the Company to serve as the disbursing agent for the
Merger Consideration and payments in respect of the Vested Company Equity
Awards, unless another agent is designated as provided in Section 2.5(a) (the
" _Disbursing Agent_ "). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
to be deposited with the Disbursing Agent (or such other agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to the
Effective Time) cash in the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of all Merger Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time plus any cash necessary to pay for Vested Company
Equity Awards and Company Restricted Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.5. Such funds may be invested by the
Disbursing Agent as directed by Parent or, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation; provided, that such investments shall be in: (i)
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or (ii) money
market accounts, certificates of deposit or demand deposits with commercial
banks having assets in excess of $100,000,000,000. Any profit or loss
resulting from, or interest and other income produced by, such investments
shall be for the account of Parent.   

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event no
more than seven (7) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Disbursing Agent to mail, to each record holder
of Merger Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions for exchanging their Merger Shares for the
Merger Consideration payable therefor. The letter of transmittal will be in
customary form and will specify that delivery of Certificates will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates and a duly executed letter of transmittal to the
Disbursing Agent. Upon surrender of such Certificate or Certificates to the
Disbursing Agent together with a properly completed and duly executed letter
of transmittal and any other documentation that the Disbursing Agent may
reasonably require pursuant to the instructions, the record holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
exchange therefor, without interest and the Certificate so surrendered shall
be canceled. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each such Certificate shall,
after the Effective Time, be deemed to represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, and until such surrender and exchange, no cash shall
be paid to the holder of such outstanding Certificate in respect
thereof.   

(c) If payment is to be made to a Person other than the registered holder of
the Merger Shares formerly represented by the Certificate or Certificates
surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Disbursing Agent any applicable
stock transfer taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Merger Shares or establish to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not payable.   

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the
Disbursing Agent, such shares shall be canceled and exchanged for
the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth, in this Article II.   

(e) If any cash deposited with the Disbursing Agent remains unclaimed nine
months after the Effective Time, such cash shall be returned to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holder who has not surrendered
such holderÂ’s Certificates for the Merger Consideration payable in respect
thereof prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Disbursing Agent shall be liable to any holder of Certificates for an
amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable unclaimed
property laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates as
of a date immediately prior to such time that such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation on such date, free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.   

(f) From and after the Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such Common Stock, other than the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement.   

(g) In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent, upon the posting by
such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
or the Disbursing Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Surviving Corporation or the Disbursing Agent with respect
to such Certificate, the Disbursing Agent will issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration in respect
thereof entitled to be received pursuant to this Agreement.   

(h) Parent, Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable
hereunder any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under any
applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so deducted and withheld,
such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder from whose Merger Consideration
the amounts were so deducted and withheld.   

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.   

(a) As of the Effective Time, each stock option, stock appreciation right or
other equity award that is settled in, or relates to, Common Stock (other
than Company Restricted Shares) held by any Company Employee under any
Company Benefit Plan (including awards under the EDN Sovintel 2005 Stock
Appreciation Rights Bonus Plan) (" _Company Equity Award_ ") which is vested
and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Vested
Company Equity Award_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to such Vested Company Equity Award multiplied by (ii)
the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise or
the strike price of the Vested Company Equity Award, as the case may be (as
adjusted on any vesting date pursuant to its terms or an applicable Company
Benefit Plan with respect to all or any portion of the shares covered
thereby), without interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and
withheld under any applicable Law except that with respect to any stock
appreciation right that has been frozen by the Company prior to the Effective
Time, the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be $53.80. In the event
that the per share exercise or strike price of any Vested Company Equity
Award, as adjusted, is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Vested Company Equity Award shall be canceled without payment therefor
and shall have no further force or effect. All payments with respect to such
Vested Company Equity Awards shall be made by the Disbursing Agent (or
such other agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall
designate prior to the Effective Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time from funds deposited by or at the direction of the
Surviving Corporation to pay such amounts in accordance with Section
2.4.   

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Company Equity Award which is unvested and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Unvested
Company Equity Award_ ") (except to the extent the applicable Company Benefit
Plan provides for automatic vesting as of the Effective Time, which award
shall be deemed a Vested Company Equity Award) shall be converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash on each of the applicable vesting dates
and subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to such Unvested
Company Equity Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the portion
of such Unvested Company Equity Award which becomes vested on such date
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over
(y) the exercise or the strike price of such Unvested Company Equity Award,
as the case may be (as adjusted on any vesting date pursuant to its terms
or an applicable Company Benefit Plan with respect to all or any portion of
the shares covered thereby), without interest and less any amounts required
to be deducted and withheld under any applicable Law except that with respect
to any stock appreciation right that has been frozen by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be deemed to be $53.80. In
the event that the per share exercise or strike price of any Unvested Company
Equity Award, as adjusted, is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Unvested Company Equity Award shall be canceled without
payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect as of
the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay the applicable
amounts which become due under this Section 2.5(b) as soon as reasonably
practicable following the applicable vesting date.   

(c) Each outstanding Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest and become free of restrictions as of the
Effective Time and be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash
equal to the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.2, without
interest and less any amounts required to be deducted and withheld under
any applicable Law. All payments with respect to such Company Restricted
Shares shall be made by the Disbursing Agent (or such other agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to the Effective
Time) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time from
funds deposited by or at the direction of the Surviving Corporation to pay
such amounts in accordance with Section 2.4.   

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will adopt such resolutions as
shall be necessary, and will take all such other actions as may be required,
to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.5, without paying
any consideration or incurring any debts or obligations on behalf of the
Company or the Surviving Corporation.   

(e) Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Disbursing Agent (or such other
agent reasonably acceptable to the Company as Parent shall designate prior to
the Effective Time) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
to be paid under this Section 2.5 in respect of Company Equity Awards and
Company Restricted Shares amounts required to be deducted and withheld under
any applicable Tax Law. To the extent any amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the
holder of Company Equity Awards and Company Restricted Shares from whose
payments in respect of Company Equity Awards and Company Restricted Shares
the amounts were so deducted and withheld.   

Section 2.6 _Merger Without Meeting or Vote of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, following the Offer and any
subsequent offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option,
the requirements for a Short Form Merger are satisfied such that the Merger
may be effected without a meeting or vote of the stockholders of the Company,
the parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate action to
consummate the Merger as a Short Form Merger as soon as practicable after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to Closing set forth in Article VIII
hereof.

(a) Section 4.17(a) of the _Company Disclosure Letter_ contains a true and
complete list of each Company Benefit Plan (other than any multiemployer plan
within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)) sponsored, maintained or
contributed to by the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, which together with the Company would be deemed
a "single employer" within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA (" _ERISA Affiliate_ "). With respect
to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made available to Merger Sub a
true, correct and complete copy of such Company Benefit Plan, and, to the
extent applicable, trust agreements, insurance contracts and other
funding vehicles, the most recent annual reports (Form 5500 series) and
accompanying schedules, summary plan descriptions, and the most recent
determination, advisory, opinion or notification letter as the case may be
from the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ").   

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (i) that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) or Section 401(k) of the Code, such Company Benefit Plan
satisfies the requirements of such section(s) and has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS with respect to its qualification, and its
related trust has been determined to be exempt from Tax under Code
Section 501(a), and to the Knowledge of the Company, its Subsidiaries and any
ERISA Affiliate, nothing has occurred to adversely affect such qualification
or exemption; (ii) each Company Benefit Plan has been operated, funded and
administered in compliance with its terms, the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement and with all applicable
requirements of Law, including ERISA and the Code, except as would not
subject the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate to any liability
that has had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the Company, its
Subsidiaries, nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in, and to the Knowledge of
the Company and any ERISA Affiliate, no transaction or act or failure to act
has occurred that would subject the Company, its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate to any liability for a breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA that
would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect; (iv) no disputes are pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate, threatened, other than ordinary claims
for benefits, which would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; (v) neither the Company, its
Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any transaction that
violates, and to the Knowledge of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
no violation exists with respect to Section 406(a) or (b) of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code (for which an exemption under such sections exists) that
would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect; and (vi) all contributions due have been made on a
timely basis. Except as would not subject the Company and its Subsidiaries to
any liability that would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, all contributions made or required to
have been made under any Company Benefit Plan for which a tax deduction under
U.S. Law is available meet the requirements for deductibility under the Code,
and all contributions that are required and which have not been made have been
properly recorded on the books of the Company or, as applicable, an ERISA
Affiliate.   

(c) No Company Benefit Plan (including for such purpose, any employee benefit
plan described in ERISA Section 3(3) that the Company, any Subsidiary or any
ERISA Affiliate maintained, sponsored or contributed to within the six-year
period preceding the Effective Time) is (i) a "multiemployer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA), (ii) a "multiple employer plan"
(within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code), or (iii) subject to Title
IV or Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Except as has not had
and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect, no "accumulated funding deficiency" (as such term
is defined in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code (whether or
not waived)) has occurred with respect to any Company Benefit Plan. Except as
has not had and would not be reasonably likely to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, no event has occurred with respect
to the Company, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate in connection with
which the Company, any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate could be subject to
liability, lien or encumbrance with respect to any Company Benefit Plan,
except for regular contributions and benefit payments in the ordinary course
of plan business.   

(d) Except as required by applicable Law, since the date hereof, there has
been no amendment to any Company Benefit Plan that would increase materially
the expense to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred by such
party therefor for the most recently completed fiscal year. Except as set
forth in Section 4.17(d) of the _Company Disclosure Letter_ , the execution
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not (either alone or together with any other related event) (i)
result in any payment by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
Affiliate to any Company Employee of any money or other property under any
Company Benefit Plan or (ii) result in the accelerated vesting or funding
through a trust or otherwise of an amount of compensation or benefits under
any Company Benefit Plan. Except as set forth in Section 4.17(d) of the
_Company Disclosure Letter_ , the execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in
payments under any Company Benefit Plan which would not be deductible under
Section 280G of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 4.17(d) of the
_Company Disclosure Letter_ or as required by applicable Law, no present
or former employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any ERISA Affiliate
are covered by any Company Benefit Plan that provides or will provide any
severance pay, post-termination health or life insurance benefits (except as
required pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA)
or similar benefits.   

(e) Except as set forth in Section 4.17(e) of the _Company Disclosure Letter_
, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any contractual obligation to
make any Tax gross up payments as a result of the golden parachute excise
taxes of Section 4999 of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
any obligation to make any Tax gross up payments as a result of the interest
and penalty provisions of Section 409A of the Code to any individual.   

(f) Except as would not subject the Company and its Subsidiaries to any
liability that would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,
each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code subject to Section 409A
of the Code has been operated in compliance with Section 409A of the
Code since January 1, 2005, based upon a good faith, reasonable
interpretation of (i) Section 409A of the Code and (ii)(A) the proposed
regulations issued thereunder, or (B) Internal Revenue Service Notice 2005-1,
and to the extent required in compliance with the final regulations
issued thereunder.   

(g) All amounts payable pursuant to any employment compensation, severance or
other Company Benefit Plan or other equity-based plan sponsored by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or payable in respect of Company Equity
Awards in accordance with this Agreement to Persons who are holders of Common
Stock or other securities of the Company (i) are being paid or granted
as compensation for past services performed, future services to be performed,
or future services to be refrained from performing, by such Persons (and
matters incidental thereto) and (ii) are not calculated based on the number
of shares tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Person.
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (A) at
a meeting duly called and held at which all members of such committee were
present, duly adopted resolutions approving as an "employment compensation,
severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule
14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act the Compensation Arrangements and the

forth in this Agreement, which resolutions have not been rescinded, modified
or withdrawn in any way and (B) has taken all other actions necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing
arrangements. Immediately prior to the Expiration Date, there will be no
Compensation Arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any stockholder of the Company that has tendered shares of
Common Stock into the Offer, on the other hand, other than those
Compensation Arrangements that have been approved by the such Compensation
Committee, prior to the Expiration Date, in accordance with the preceding
sentence and with respect to which such committee has taken all other
actions, prior to the Expiration Date, necessary to satisfy the requirements
of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act.

the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, and at all times since January

Contract_ "), except for those "material contracts" that have been filed as
exhibits to any Company SEC Reports filed by the Company.   

(b) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in breach of or default (with or

VimpelCom and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto. The
Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded

Commitment Letter or VimpelCom with respect to the Merger Sub Commitment
Letter to reduce the total amount of the Financing or impose any additional

the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute or
may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or

Date, (i) the Company or any of its Representatives has received a written
Company Acquisition Proposal from any Person that the Board of Directors of
the Company (acting through the Special Committee) determines in good
faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside
counsel) to be bona fide and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company
(acting through the Special Committee) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside counsel)
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would be reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal from such Person and (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure to take action with
respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) and (B)
participate in discussions and negotiations with the Person making
such Company Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such

information to such Person without entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, and (y) will promptly provide to Merger Sub any
non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to

two calendar days) notify Parent and Merger Sub orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in
negotiations concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal.   

(c) Subject to Section 7.4(d), neither the Board of Directors of the Company
nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to withdraw

Company Stockholder Meeting adverse to such Recommendation or approve or
recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, a Company Acquisition Proposal.

time prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company receives a Company Acquisition
Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company (acting through the
Special Committee) concludes in good faith (after consultation with its
independent financial advisor and outside counsel) constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (after consultation with its outside counsel) that the failure
to take action with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee) may withdraw
or modify its Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent and Merger Sub (a
" _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "); provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of the Company (acting through the Special Committee) may not
effect a Recommendation Withdrawal pursuant to this Section 7.4(d) unless the
Company has provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub, at least
two Business Days in advance, of its intention to effect a Recommendation
Withdrawal in response to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify

Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors (acting through the
Special Committee), after receipt of advice from its outside legal counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its disclosure obligations
under applicable Law.   

(f) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 7.4 by its Subsidiaries or any Representative of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 7.4
by the Company.   

Section 7.5 _Director and Officer Liability_.   

(a) From and after the Director Effective Time, the Company (and following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) shall to the greatest extent
permitted by Law indemnify and hold harmless and comply with all of the
CompanyÂ’s and its respective SubsidiariesÂ’ obligations to indemnify and hold
harmless (including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) (i)
the present and former officers and directors thereof (the " _Indemnified
Persons_ ") against any and all costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (" _Damages_ "), arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any acts or omissions occurring or alleged
to occur prior to or at the Acceptance Date to the extent provided under the
CompanyÂ’s or such SubsidiariesÂ’ respective organizational and
governing documents or agreements in effect on the date hereof, and (ii) such
persons against any and all Damages arising out of acts or omissions in
connection with such persons serving as an officer or director of the
Company. For a period of six (6) years after the Director Effective Time,
the Company or Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect
the current policies of officersÂ’ and directorsÂ’ liability insurance
maintained on the date hereof by the Company and its respective Subsidiaries
(the " _Current Policies_ "); provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation may, and in the event of the cancellation or
termination of such policies shall, substitute therefor policies with
reputable and financially sound carriers (with a Standard and PoorÂ’s rating of
at least A) providing at least the same coverage and amount and containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the covered persons (the "
_Replacement Policies_ ") in respect of claims arising from facts or events
that existed or occurred prior to or at the Director Effective Time under the
Current Policies; provided, further, however, that in no event will the
Company or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in excess
of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company under the Current
Policies (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") (in which event, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the
Insurance Amount); provided, further, however, that in lieu of the foregoing
insurance coverage, Parent may direct the Company to purchase
"tail" insurance coverage that provides coverage not materially less
favorable than the coverage described above, provided that the Company shall
not be required to pay any amounts in respect of such coverage prior to the
Director Effective Time.   

(b) Merger Sub agrees that, for the period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the sixth anniversary thereof, the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws shall (except to the extent reflected
in _Exhibits A_ and _B_ ) contain provisions no less favorable with respect
to exculpation from liabilities and indemnification of the
Indemnified Persons of the Company than are currently provided in the
CompanyÂ’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, which provisions shall not
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any such individual. Any amendment of
the exculpation or indemnification provisions of the CompanyÂ’s Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, as reflected in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
certificate of incorporation and bylaws, will be prospective only, and will
not in any way diminish or adversely affect any rights or protections of any
Person under the CompanyÂ’s existing Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws in
respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the Effective Time.   

(c) This Section 7.5 shall survive the consummation of the Offer and the
Merger and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
the Indemnified Persons, their respective heirs and personal representatives
and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its successors. In the
event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all its properties and assets to
any person (including by dissolution), then, and in each such case, Parent
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors of
the Surviving Corporation assume and honor the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.5.   

(d) The agreements and covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be
exclusive of any other rights to which any such Indemnified Persons are
entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. The provisions of
this Section 7.5 are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
contract or otherwise.   

Section 7.6 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or becomes
applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the parties shall take all reasonable action requested by
Parent to exclude the applicability to the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement of any Takeover Statute and the
parties shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so that such transactions may be
consummated as promptly as possible.   

Section 7.7 _Public Announcements_. Except with respect to any Recommendation
Withdrawal or any action taken by the Company or its Board of Directors
pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 7.4, so long as this Agreement
is in effect, the parties will consult with each other before issuing any
press release or making any public statement or taking any action that
would require a filing obligation under the Exchange Act, with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except for any
press release or public statement as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or any listing agreement with the New York Stock Exchange and the
Nasdaq Global Select Market, will not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the consent of the other parties hereto (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   

Section 7.8 _Confidentiality Agreement_. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that this Agreement does not in any manner modify or limit the rights
and obligations of the parties under the Confidentiality Agreement, except
that the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to allow the
taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement. The
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon the Acceptance Date.   

Section 7.9 _Notice of Current Events_. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Acceptance Date, the Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other orally and in writing of (i) the occurrence, or non-
occurrence, of any event that, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not to be satisfied, (ii) the failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to result in
any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be
satisfied (iii) any notice or communication from FAS or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, or (iv) knowledge of any suits, actions, claims or investigations or
proceedings commenced or threatened against the Company, its
Subsidiaries, Parent, or its Subsidiaries, that if pending on the date of
this Agreement would have been required to be disclosed under this Agreement
or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 7.9 is
for informational purposes, shall not cure any breach of any representation
or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this
Agreement and shall not otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any party or parties receiving such notice.   

Section 7.10 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_.   

(a) If any outstanding Company Equity Award has an exercise price that is less
than the fair market value of the Shares underlying such Company Equity Award
on the date such Company Equity Award was granted, the Company shall, in
consultation with Parent, take such steps as are approved in writing by
Parent to amend, prior to December 31, 2008, or such later date as is
permitted under the applicable regulations or guidance issued by the Internal
Revenue Service, the terms of such Company Equity Award to the extent
reasonably required to avoid the imposition of a tax under Section 409A of
the Code.   

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the first
anniversary thereof, maintain for the individuals employed by the Company on
the Acceptance Date (the " _Current Employees_ ") compensation and benefits
provided under employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation that are
at least as favorable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits
maintained for and provided to Current Employees immediately prior to the
Acceptance (excluding, for this purpose, equity-based compensation);
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.10 shall prevent
the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan or interfere with
the Surviving CorporationÂ’s right or obligation to make such changes as are
necessary to conform with applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 7.10 shall
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Current Employee at any
time.   

(c) The Surviving Corporation will cause service rendered by Current Employees
of the Company prior to the Acceptance Date to be taken into account for
vesting and eligibility purposes (but not for accrual purposes, except for
vacation and severance, if required by applicable law) under employee benefit
plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, to the same extent
as such service was taken into account under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plans of the Company for those purposes. The Surviving Corporation
will use reasonable efforts to cause Current Employees not to be subject to
any pre-existing condition limitation under any health employee benefit plan
of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries for any condition for which
they would have been entitled to coverage under the corresponding Company
Benefit Plan in which they participated prior to the Acceptance Date. The
Surviving Corporation will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, give such
Current Employees credit under such employee benefit plans for co-payments
made and deductibles satisfied prior to the Acceptance Date.   

(d) No later than five Business Days prior to its distribution, the Company
shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with a copy of any communication intended
to be made to any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and will provide an opportunity for
Parent and Merger Sub to make reasonable revisions thereto.   

(e) This Section 7.10 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of
each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 7.10,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 7.10 or
is intended to be, shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to
or modification of any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Company,
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates or limit in any
way the right of the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any of its respective employee
benefit plans or arrangements.   

Section 7.11 _Financing_.   

(a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts
to: (i) arrange for the Merger Sub Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Merger Sub Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into the Definitive
Merger Sub Loan Documents with respect to the Merger Sub Financing no later
than the Financing Documentation Deadline; (iii) deliver Evidence of Funding
in respect of the Definitive Merger Sub Loan Documents to the Company no
later than the Financing Documentation Deadline; (iv) satisfy all conditions
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Definitive Merger Sub Loan
Documents; (v) consummate the Merger Sub Financing (to the extent required to
pay for shares of Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and
not withdrawn) as of the Expiration Date following the date as of which all
of the Offer Conditions are satisfied or waived and after Vimpelcom and
Merger Sub have entered into the Definitive Merger Sub Loan Documents with
respect to the Merger Sub Financing and (vi) consummate the Merger
Sub Financing (to the extent, following the Acceptance Date, required to pay
for shares of Common Stock validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering
Period, and as required to consummate the Merger). Merger Sub shall not
approve, agree to, or enter into any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Merger Sub Commitment
Letter.   

(b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts
to procure that VimpelCom shall: (i) arrange for the Financing on the terms
and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into the
Definitive VimpelCom Loan Documents with respect to the Financing no later
than the Financing Documentation Deadline; (iii) deliver Evidence of Funding
in respect of the Definitive VimpelCom Loan Documents to the Company no later
than the Financing Documentation Deadline, (iv) satisfy all conditions
applicable to VimpelCom in the Definitive VimpelCom Loan Documents; (v)
consummate the Financing (to the extent required to pay for shares of Common
Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn) as of the
Expiration Date following the date as of which all of the Offer Conditions
are satisfied or waived and after VimpelCom and the lenders party to the Debt
Commitment Letter have entered into the Definitive VimpelCom Loan Documents
with respect to the Financing; (vi) consummate the Financing (to the extent,
following the Acceptance Date, required to pay for shares of Common Stock
validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period, and as required to
consummate the Merger) and (vii) call a meeting to seek the VimpelCom
Shareholder Approval to the extent such approval is determined to be required
(in the reasonable judgment of VimpelCom after taking advice from external
legal counsel) under applicable Law to approve VimpelCom entering into the
Definitive Merger Sub Loan Documents with respect to the Merger Sub
Financing. Parent and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to procure that VimpelCom not approve, agree to, or enter into any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under,
the Debt Commitment Letter.   

(c) In the event that VimpelCom procures alternative Financing to the Debt
Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly provide the Company with copies of
any documentation evidencing such alternative sources of Financing and shall
give the Company prompt notice (but in any event within two Business Days) of
any material breach by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or
any termination of the Debt Commitment Letter. In such event, Parent shall
keep the Company informed on a current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of efforts to arrange for the Financing (or replacements thereof). For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Financing (or any replacement or alternative
financing) and the Merger Sub Financing has not been obtained, Parent and
Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated to consummate the Offer and the
Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto
(including the occurrence of the Financing Documentation Deadline).   

Section 7.12 _Delivery of Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to Parent
and Merger Sub certificates, dated within thirty (30) days prior to the
Acceptance Date and the Effective Time, respectively, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and consistent with the Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1.1445-2(c)(3), certifying that the Offer
(in the case of the certificate delivered prior to the Acceptance Date) and
the Merger (in the case of the certificate delivered prior to the Effective
Time) is exempt from withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real
Property Tax Act.

(i) after the Outside Date (as it may be extended), if the Acceptance Date
shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date (as it may be extended)

principally the result of, or caused by, the failure of the party seeking to
exercise such termination right to perform or observe any of the covenants or
agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement; or    

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 8.1(b) shall be

not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
is the principal cause of or resulted in the application or imposition of
such Restraint.   

(c) by the Company, prior to the Acceptance Date:    

(i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred

change to the Offer in material violation of Section 1.1(b) of this Agreement
but, in the case of clause (iv) and/or (v) of Section 1.1(b), only if Merger
Sub shall have failed to cure such actions within three (3) Business Days
after having received written notice from the Company stating its intention
to terminate and detailing the actions giving rise to such right to
terminate; provided, however, in the case of the foregoing clause (A), (B) or

and such breach is incapable of being cured by the Outside Date; provided,
however, that neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of
this Agreement; or    

(ii) if prior to the Acceptance Date, the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof (A) shall have effected a Recommendation Withdrawal or

contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

Section 10.11 _Jurisdiction_.   

(a) Each party irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of (i) the Court of

subject matter jurisdiction is vested in such court under applicable Law, any
Federal court of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware, solely
for the purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding between any of
the parties hereto arising out of this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated hereby. Each party agrees to commence any suit, action or
proceeding relating hereto in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
or, in the event that exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is vested in
such court under applicable Law, any Federal court of the United States
sitting in the State of Delaware. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
between any of the parties hereto arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby in (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, and (ii) in the event that exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is
vested in such court under applicable Law, any Federal court of the United
States sitting in the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such
court that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has

consents to the service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in
any such suit, action or other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by
registered mail to such party at its address set forth in this Agreement, such
service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such
registered mail; provided that nothing in this Section 10.11 shall affect the
right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
law. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 10.11 shall not
constitute a general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware
and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section
10.11. The parties agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.   

(b) EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.   

Section 10.12 _Authorship_. The parties agree that the terms and language of
this Agreement were the result of negotiations between the parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any party. Any
controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without
regard to events of authorship or negotiation.   

Section 10.13 _Remedies of Parent and Merger Sub_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur to Parent and Merger Sub, damages would be difficult to determine
and would be an insufficient remedy and no other adequate remedy would exist
at law or in equity, in each case in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached by the Company (or the Company
threatens such a breach). It is accordingly agreed that in the event of a
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement against the Company, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity and it is
further agreed that no bond shall be required to be posted by Parent
or Merger Sub in connection with the issuance of any injunctive relief. The
Company irrevocably waives any defenses based on adequacy of any other
remedy, whether at law or in equity, that might be asserted as a bar to the
remedy of specific performance of any of the terms or provisions hereof or
injunctive relief in any action brought therefor by Parent or Merger Sub. For
the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company or any person acting on
behalf of, or claiming rights through, the Company be entitled to seek
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief to enforce
any obligations of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement or any other
Person under any other agreement or arrangement relating to or arising from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce the
Confidentiality Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement, but only to the extent
and in the circumstances that such agreements specifically provide for such
relief.
