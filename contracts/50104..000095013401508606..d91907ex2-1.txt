Assets remain located at the Pipelines  or any other owned or leased real
property constituting part of the  Purchased Assets after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall grant to Seller  and other members of the BP Group and their
respective representatives  reasonable access to such property from and after
the Closing Date for  a reasonable period of time not to exceed 180 days in
order to permit  Seller and such persons to review and remove such Excluded
Assets and  make any other appropriate arrangements with respect thereto.
Seller  agrees that it will consult with Buyer in advance of taking any
such  actions following the Closing Date with a view towards establishing a 
mutually agreeable plan for such review and removal so that these  actions

Interest.   3. DEPOSIT AND PURCHASE PRICE.   (a) Deposit. On the date
hereof, Buyer shall pay to Seller (or  Seller\'s designee) in immediately
available funds, by wire transfer to  an account designated by Seller, a non-
refundable deposit against the  Purchase Price of certain of the Purchased
Assets (excluding all  interests in real property) in an amount equal to Five
Million Dollars  ($5,000,000) (the "Deposit"). The Deposit shall be non-
refundable in  that it shall not be returned to Buyer under any
circumstances, unless  this Agreement shall be terminated by Buyer or by
Seller, the Closing  shall not have occurred and a Deposit Return Event has
occurred in  which event Seller shall transfer to Buyer, in immediately
available  funds by wire transfer to an account designated by Buyer, a cash
amount  equal to the Deposit plus interest thereon from the date on which
the  Deposit was received by Seller through and including the date on which 
such payment is made at a rate of 4% per annum. As used herein, the  term
"Deposit Return Event" means the occurrence of any of the  following:   (i)
between the date hereof and the Closing Date, there shall  have occurred any
damage, destruction or other casualty losses with  respect to the Purchased
Assets that (A) cause the Purchased Assets to  become unusable or inoperable
and not capable of repair for a period of  at least ninety (90) days or (B)
individually or in the aggregate, have  an estimated cost (as determined by
Seller in good faith) to repair or  replace of more than Seventeen Million
Two Hundred    5     Thousand Dollars ($17,200,000), that has not been
substantially  repaired or rectified by Seller by the later of the Closing
Date or  within ninety (90) days after Seller becomes aware of the existence
of  such matter (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that if Seller 
elects to repair or rectify any such damage, destruction or other  casualty
losses, Seller shall bear the cost of any such repair or  replacement);  
(ii) each of Buyer and Seller mutually agree that the closing  condition set
forth in Sections 12(d) and 13(d) has become incapable of  fulfillment and
each of Buyer and Seller have complied with the  obligations of Section
10(c)(i);   (iii) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 
18(a)(i);   (iv) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 
18(a)(ii) (other than pursuant to Section 12(d) which is covered under 
Section 3(a)(ii) above); provided, however, that at the time of such 
termination, Buyer is not in material breach of its representations, 
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, except  with
respect to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in Section  12(e) for
which the material breach of Buyer\'s representations,  warranties, covenants
or agreements contained herein shall be ignored;   (v) this Agreement is
terminated by Seller pursuant to Section  18(a)(iv), provided, however, that
at the time of such termination,  Buyer is not in material breach of its
representations, warranties,  covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or   (vi) this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to
Section  18(a)(v); provided, however, that at the time of such termination, 
Buyer is not in material breach of its representations, warranties, 
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.   (b) Purchase Price.
In consideration for the Purchased Assets, Buyer shall pay, transfer and
undertake to Seller as follows:   (i) Buyer shall pay to Seller (or
Seller\'s designee) in cash a  price of Ninety Million Dollars ($90,000,000),
representing the value  of the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date (the
"Purchase Price");  and   (ii) Buyer shall assume and agree to pay and
perform and  discharge when due the Assumed Liabilities.   (c) Closing Date
Payments. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall  pay to Seller (or Seller\'s
designee), in immediately available funds by  wire transfer to an account
designated by Seller, the Purchase Price  minus an amount equal to the
Deposit specified in Section 3(a) above  (which amount shall already have
been paid by Buyer to Seller upon the  execution of this Agreement) plus
interest thereon from the date on  which the deposit was received by Seller
through and including the  Closing Date at a rate of 4% per annum.   
6     4. ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES.   (a) Assumed Liabilities. As of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall,  without any further action on the part of Buyer
or Seller, assume and  agree to pay, perform and discharge, and indemnify,
defend and hold  Seller and the other members of the BP Group harmless from,
each of the  following liabilities (collectively, the "Assumed
Liabilities")  (provided that the Assumed Liabilities shall not include the
Excluded  Liabilities):   (i) all obligations, responsibilities,
liabilities,  costs and expenses of whatever kind and nature, primary or 
secondary, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, whether  based in
common law or statute or arising under written  contract or otherwise, known
or unknown, liquidated or  unliquidated, real or potential, tangible or
intangible,  whether or not accrued, caused by, arising out of, incurred in 
connection with or relating in any way to the ownership of the  Purchased
Assets or the operation of the Pipeline Interest now  existing or arising at
any time prior to, on or after the  Closing Date as heretofore, currently or
hereafter conducted.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing in
this  subparagraph (i), the Assumed Liabilities shall include all 
obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, costs and expenses  of Seller
and/or any other member of the BP Group caused by,  arising out of, incurred
in connection with or relating in any  way to any of the following, prior to,
on or after the Closing  Date:   (A) the Pipelines, the Pipeline Real
Property  and the Personal Property;   (B) all of the agreements,
contracts, leases,  permits or similar instruments, including  the Pipeline
Agreements, easements,  rights-of-way and other rights of access, 
constituting part of the Purchased Assets;   (C) the Permits;   (D) all
accounts payable and accrued liabilities  relating to goods and/or services

10. COVENANTS.   (a) Covenants of Seller. Seller covenants and agrees as 
follows:   (i) Access and Information. Subject to the provisions  of the
letter agreement between Buyer and Seller with respect  to confidentiality
dated on or about December 12, 2000 (the  "Confidentiality Agreement") and
upon reasonable notice,  Seller shall grant, or cause to be granted to, Buyer
access  during normal business hours throughout the period between the  date
of this Agreement and the Closing Date to the Purchased  Assets and the books
and records and other information  relating to the operations of the Pipeline
Interest. During  this period, Seller shall use all commercially reasonable 
efforts to furnish, or cause to be furnished to, Buyer and its 
representatives all data and information concerning the  Purchased Assets and
the operation of the Pipeline Interest  (the "Data") which may reasonably be
requested by Buyer and  shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to
make  available, or cause to be made available, such personnel of  Seller as
may reasonably be requested for the furnishing of  such Data. During this
period, Buyer shall not contact or  communicate with any employees, customers
of or suppliers to  the Pipeline Interest without Seller\'s prior written
consent.  Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and its affiliates  harmless
against any and all Losses suffered in connection  with the exercise of
Buyer\'s rights under this Section  10(a)(i). Notwithstanding any provision
in this Agreement to  the contrary, Buyer\'s obligations under this Section
10(a)(i)  shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (ii) Conduct of
Business. Except as provided on the  Schedules attached hereto, Seller shall:
operate the Pipeline  Interest in the ordinary course of business consistent
with  past practice or as described in the Offering Memorandum; use 
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain satisfactory  relationships with
employees, suppliers, distributors,  customers and others having business
relationships with the  Pipeline Interest; use commercially reasonable
efforts to      19    maintain the Purchased Assets in reasonably good
operating  condition, normal wear and tear excepted; maintain its  inventory
of supplies, parts and other materials and  inventories and keep its books of
account records and files,  in each case in the ordinary course of business
consistent  with past practice; refrain from (A) amending, modifying, 
waiving any rights under or terminating (or allowing to  terminate) any
material contract, except in the ordinary  course of business, (B) disposing
of, encumbering, selling or  otherwise transferring any of the material
assets constituting  Purchased Assets or other rights of the Pipeline
Interest, (C)  commencing any new capital projects or making any additional 
commitments for capital expenditures relating to the Pipeline  Interest in
excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)  in the aggregate, or (D)
granting or agreeing to grant any  bonus to any employees of the Pipeline
Interest, except for  any bonus approved prior to the date hereof or made in
the  ordinary course of business, or enter into any contract of  employment,
involving aggregate annual salary in excess of Two  Hundred Thousand Dollars
($200,000), collective bargaining  agreement or other labor contract with
respect to any such  employees outside of the ordinary course of business;
provided  that Seller may take any action to which Buyer consents (which 
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld taking account of  Buyer\'s and
Seller\'s commercial objectives with respect to the  Purchased Assets).  
(iii) Schedules.   (A) Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall  notify
Buyer of additions or changes to the  Schedules to this Agreement required
to  reflect events since the date of this  Agreement or facts discovered by
Seller  after the date hereof, so as to cause  Seller\'s representations and
warranties  contained herein (other than any which speak  as to a particular
date) to be true and  correct in all material respects as of the  Closing
Date. Notices given by Seller  pursuant to this Section 10(a)(iii) will be 
deemed to have amended the Schedules, to  have qualified the representations
and  warranties contained in Sections 6 and 7,  and to have corrected any
misrepresentation  or breach of warranty that otherwise might  have existed
hereunder by reason of the  fact, circumstance, event or development  (with
the result that no misrepresentation  or breach shall be deemed to have
occurred),  in each case to the extent of the disclosure  contained in such
notice, including for  purposes of Section 12(b).   (B) If such additions
or changes would have a  material adverse effect on the Pipeline  Interest,
taken as a whole, as it is  currently operated by Seller, the parties  shall
negotiate in good faith to determine a  reasonable adjustment to the Purchase
Price  to fully reflect any Losses actually  incurred by Buyer resulting
from such  matters. For purposes of this Section  10(a)(iii) only, such
additions or changes  shall be deemed to have a material adverse  effect on
the Pipeline      20    Interest only if such adverse effect exceeds 
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000).   (C) In the event that the parties
hereto are  unable to agree upon on an adjustment to the  Purchase Price
prior to the Closing Date,  each party agrees that the Closing will take 
place without delay as set forth in this  Agreement and the Buyer shall pay
the full  purchase price. The Parties further agree,  upon the demand of any
party, to submit the  need for, and size of, any adjustment to the  Purchase
Price to binding arbitration. A  party desiring to submit to arbitration
any  such matter shall furnish its demand for  arbitration in writing to the
other party  within a ten (10) day period commencing on  the closing date.
The arbitration shall be  conducted before three (3) arbitrators who  are
experienced in matters pertaining to the  pipeline industry. The arbitrators
shall not  be a past or present officer, director or  employee of any party
or any of its  affiliates. The arbitration shall be  governed by the
Commercial Arbitration Rules  of the American Arbitration Association. 
Should the arbitrators render a decision in  favor of the Buyer for an
adjustment in the  Purchase Price, Seller shall pay to Buyer  such amount
plus interest from the Closing  Date through and including the date payment 
is made at a rate of 4% per annum.   (iv) Confidentiality. After the
Closing, Seller shall  maintain the confidentiality of all information,
documents and  materials relating exclusively to the Pipeline Interest, 
including all such materials which remain in the possession of  Seller,
except to the extent that disclosure of any such  information is requested or
required by law (by oral  questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or other  documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil
investigative  demand or any other similar legal process) or legal or 
administrative process or authorized by Buyer or reasonably  occurs in
connection with disputes over the terms of this  Agreement. The provisions of
this Section 10(a)(iv) shall not  apply to any information, documents or
materials which are in  the public domain or shall come into public domain,
other than  by reason of a breach by the Seller of its obligations 
hereunder. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller  shall be
permitted to disclose any confidential information  (i) to any other member
of the BP Group or (ii) as required to  operate Seller\'s ongoing business,
provided such member shall  comply with the terms of this Section
10(a)(iv).   (b) Covenants of Buyer. Buyer covenants and agrees as
follows:   (i) Confidentiality.   (A) Buyer acknowledges that all
information  provided to any of it and its affiliates,  directors, officers,
employees, counsel,  auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and  other
representatives by Seller and other  members of the BP Group and their
respective  directors,       21    officers, employees, counsel,
auditors,  accountants, agents, advisors and other  representatives is
subject to the terms of  the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of  which
are hereby incorporated herein by  reference. Effective upon, and only
upon,  the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement  shall terminate only with
respect to  information provided to any of Buyer and its  affiliates,
directors, officers, employees,  counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, 
advisors and other representatives that  relates solely to the Purchased
Assets and  the Assumed Liabilities; provided that Buyer  acknowledges that
any and all information  provided or made available to any of it and  its
affiliates, directors, officers,  employees, counsel, auditors,
accountants,  agents, advisors and other representatives  by or on behalf of
Seller (other than  information relating solely to the Purchased  Assets and
the Assumed Liabilities) shall  remain subject to the terms and conditions 
of the Confidentiality Agreement on and  after the Closing Date.   (B)
Buyer agrees that, from and after the  Closing Date, Buyer shall, and shall
cause  its affiliates, directors, officers,  employees, counsel, auditors,
accountants,  agents, advisors and other representatives  to, keep the
Seller Information confidential  following the Closing Date, except to the 
extent that disclosure of any such Seller  Information is requested or
required by law  (by oral questions, interrogatories,  requests for
information or other documents  in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil 
investigative demand or any other similar  legal process) or legal or
administrative  process or authorized by Seller or  reasonably occurs in
connection with  disputes over the terms of this Agreement.  The provisions
of this Section 10(b)(i)(B)  shall not apply to any information,  documents
or materials which are in the  public domain or shall come into the public 
domain, other than by reason of a breach by  Buyer of its obligations
hereunder or under  the Confidentiality Agreement. Furthermore, 
notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall  be permitted to disclose the
Seller  Information to any of its affiliates,  provided such affiliate shall
comply with  the terms of this Section 10(b)(i)(B). In  connection with the
Transferred Employees,  Buyer shall use commercially reasonable  efforts, at
Seller\'s request and at Buyer\'s  expense, to enforce existing
confidentiality  agreements and rights requiring employees to  keep trade
secrets confidential. For  purposes of this Agreement, "Seller  Information"
shall mean all information  concerning Seller and/or any other member of 
the BP Group, other than information that  relates exclusively to the
Pipeline  Interest, the Purchased Assets and the  Assumed Liabilities and
other than any such  information that is available to the public  on the
Closing Date, or thereafter becomes  available to the public, other than as
a  result of a breach of this Section 10(b)(i).      22    (ii)
Notification. From the date hereof through and  including the Closing Date,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller  if Buyer obtains knowledge that any
representation or warranty  of Seller in this Agreement or any agreement
contemplated  hereby or information set forth in the Schedules hereto is
not  true and correct in all material respects, or if Buyer obtains 
knowledge of any material errors in, or omissions from, the  Schedules to
this Agreement.   (iii) Litigation. With respect to all litigation and 
other matters set forth on the Schedules attached hereto and  any other
matters that constitute Excluded Liabilities and for  so long as Seller is
contesting or defending such matter,  Buyer shall cooperate in all respects
with Seller and other  members of the BP Group and their respective counsel
in their  efforts to conduct or resolve such litigation, including by 
making available to them such documents and witnesses as may  be deemed
necessary or useful therefor in Seller\'s sole but  reasonable discretion.
With respect to any dispute or  litigation involving any terminated Employee
seeking  reinstatement, Buyer shall take such actions as are necessary  for
Seller to comply with the terms of any judgment, decision  or order of any
proper authority issued in connection with  such dispute or litigation
(including by offering to employ  such former Employee) and shall treat any
former Employee who  is ordered to be reinstated as a Transferred Employee
for all  purposes hereunder.   (iv) Title Policies. Buyer may procure, and
shall pay  the cost of the premium for commitments or policies from title 
insurance companies to provide owner\'s title insurance  policies with
respect to the portions of the Purchased Assets  constituting real property,
provided, however, that Buyer\'s  ability or inability to obtain title
insurance (and without  regard to (i) any exceptions contained therein and
(ii) any  title insurance premium Buyer is required to pay in order to 
obtain such title insurance) on such real property for any  reason shall not
cause there to be an adjustment to the  Purchase Price and shall not cause
the Closing of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
delayed.   (v) Removal of Seller Marks. Buyer agrees that,  within three
(3) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall  (i) remove, obliterate, cover
or replace, as appropriate, all  signs, billboards, containers, drums,
advertisements or other  media containing any service marks, trade names,
trade dress  or other indicia of origin of Seller or any member of the BP 
Group, including the words "Amoco" and "Standard," any items  that include
the words "Amoco" or "Standard," the BP Group  torch and oval design, the
letters "BP," any items that  include the word "BP," the phrase "BP Oil," the
BP Group  shield or the BP Group Helios logo or variants thereof located  on
or appurtenant to any of the Purchased Assets, including  signs, billboards
and advertisements or other media located at  offices and facilities related
to the Pipeline Interest; and  (ii) return to Seller or, at Seller\'s option,
destroy (and  certify such destruction to Seller) all items and materials, 
including stationery, letterhead and purchase orders, located  at any of the
Purchased Assets containing the above described  marks. In addition, Buyer
agrees that, within three (3) months  after       23    the Closing
Date, Buyer shall replace all signs located along  each Pipeline, including
at river crossings, that identify BP,  BP Pipelines or any other member of
the BP Group as the  operator of such Pipeline.   (c) Mutual Covenants.
Buyer and Seller covenant and agree as  follows:   (i) H-S-R/State
Regulatory Approvals. Buyer and  Seller shall each file or cause to be filed
with (A) the  Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of 
Justice any notifications required to be filed under the H-S-R  Act and (B)
the Public Service Commission of North Dakota the  application required to be
filed pursuant to applicable law,  in each case with respect to the
transactions contemplated  hereby, and Buyer and Seller shall bear the costs
and expenses  of their respective filings; provided that Buyer and Seller 
shall each pay 50% of the filing fee in connection therewith.  Buyer and
Seller shall use their respective reasonable best  efforts to make such
filings promptly (and in any event within  fourteen (14) days) following the
date hereof, to respond  promptly to any requests for additional information
and  documentary materials made by either of such agencies, to make  any
further filings that may be necessary, proper or advisable  in connection
therewith, to cause the waiting periods under  the H-S-R Act to terminate or
expire at the earliest possible  date, to successfully complete the approval
process before the  Public Service Commission of North Dakota at the
earliest  possible date and to resist in good faith, at each of their 
respective cost and expense (including the institution or  defense of legal
proceedings), any assertion that the  transactions contemplated hereby
constitute a violation of the  antitrust laws or are adverse to the public
interest, all to  the end of expediting consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby. Each of Buyer, on the one hand, and  Seller, on the
other, shall consult with the other prior to  any meetings, by telephone or
in person, with the staff of the  applicable governmental authorities, and
each of Buyer and  Seller shall have the right to have a representative
present  at any such meeting.   (ii) Assignments.   (A) (I) With respect
to any agreement, contract,  license, lease, easement, right-of-way or 
Permit which (1) is not an Excluded Asset,  (2) is material to the operation
of the  Pipeline Interest as it is currently  operated by Seller and (3)
requires consent  for the assignment thereof to Buyer, Seller  shall take
such actions as are commercially  reasonable and necessary, and Buyer shall 
cooperate fully with Seller in all  commercially reasonable respects, to
effect  assignment thereof to Buyer as of the  Closing Date. It is
understood that such  actions by Seller shall not include any  requirement
of Seller to expend money,  commence any litigation or offer or grant  any
accommodation (financial or otherwise)  to any third party. In the event that
Seller  is unable to obtain the requisite approval  for assignment of any
such agreement,  contract, license, lease, easement,  right-of-way or
Permit, or in the event such  agreement, contract, license, lease, 
easement,       24    right-of-way or Permit is required to be 
amended or supplemented and is not so  amended or supplemented as of the
Closing  Date, and such assignment is reasonably  necessary to conduct the
operation of the  Pipeline Interest in the ordinary course of  business
without giving rise to a material  adverse effect on the Pipeline Interest,
at  the written request of Buyer on or before  the Closing Date (except
where such action  would be unlawful or prohibited by such  agreement,
contract, license, lease,  easement, right-of-way or Permit), Seller  shall
(x) retain any such agreement,  contract, license, lease, easement,  right-
of-way or Permit and shall enter into  an arrangement with Buyer to provide
Buyer  with the benefits of such agreement,  contract, license, lease,
easement,  right-of-way or Permit, provided, that Buyer  shall perform
Seller\'s obligations  thereunder arising on or after the Closing  Date (and
indemnify Seller against Losses  suffered in connection therewith) until
such  agreement, contract, license, lease,  easement, right-of-way or Permit
is assigned  to Buyer or expires at the earliest  opportunity in accordance
with its terms, or  is properly amended or supplemented, and (y)  take all
commercially reasonable and  necessary actions required to assign to  Buyer,
or amend or supplement any such  agreement, contract, license, lease, 
easement, right-of-way or Permit as soon as  practicable after the Closing
Date; and   (II) In addition to the obligations of  Seller under Section
10(c)(ii)(A)(I) above,  from the Closing Date until the second  anniversary
of the Closing Date, Seller  shall take such actions as are commercially 
reasonable and necessary, including  expending money, and Seller shall
cooperate  fully with Buyer in all commercially  reasonable respects, to
remedy the absence  or invalidity of any easement, right-of-way,  permit,
license or other right of access  relating to the Purchased Assets.   (B)
Notwithstanding Seller\'s obligations  pursuant to Section 10(c)(ii)(A),
the  assignment of any agreement, contract,  license, lease, easement,
right-of-way or  Permit to be transferred to Buyer which  requires consent
for assignment, or  amendment or supplement, may be effected  after the
Closing Date. The Purchase Price  shall not be subject to adjustment, and
the  Closing of the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement shall not
be delayed, by  reason of any inability to obtain consent  for assignment of
any agreement, contract,  license, lease, easement, right-of-way or  Permit
or any such amendment or supplement.  Buyer acknowledges that certain
consents to  the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement may be
required from parties to  agreements, contracts, licenses, leases, 
easements, rights-of-way or Permits (written  or otherwise) to which any of
Seller or  other member of the BP Group is a party, and  such consents may
not be obtained (provided  that Seller has complied with its      
25    obligations under this Section 10(c)(ii)).  Buyer agrees that Seller
shall not have any  liability whatsoever to Buyer arising out of  or
relating to the failure to obtain any  consents that may have been or may
be  required in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement or because of  the default, acceleration or termination of  any
such agreement, contract, license,  lease, easement, right-of-way or Permit
as a  result thereof (provided that Seller has  complied with its
obligations under this  Section 10(c)(ii)). Buyer further agrees  that no
representation, warranty or covenant  of Seller contained herein shall be
breached  or deemed breached and no condition of Buyer  shall be deemed not
to be satisfied as a  result of the failure to obtain any consent  or as a
result of any such default,  acceleration or termination or any lawsuit, 
action, claim, proceeding or investigation  commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of  any Persons arising out of or relating to  the failure to obtain
any consent or any  such default, acceleration or termination  (provided
that Seller has complied with its  obligations under this Section
10(c)(ii)).   (C) With respect to any agreement, contract,  license, lease,
easement, right-of-way or  Permit that may not be properly assigned to 
Buyer because of the failure to obtain a  required consent or that may not be
operated  or used by Seller for Buyer\'s benefit, Buyer  shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless  Seller and the other members of the BP Group  from
and against any liability that Seller  or any other members of the BP Group
may  have in connection with such nontransferred  agreements, contracts,
licenses, leases,  easements, rights-of-way or Permits as a  result of the
transactions contemplated by  this Agreement; provided that, for the 
avoidance of doubt, it is expressly  understood and agreed that in the
event  Seller is unable to provide Buyer the  benefits of any such
agreement, contract,  license, lease, easement, right-of-way or  Permit,
Buyer shall not be required to  indemnify Seller against Losses suffered in 
connection therewith until and to the extent  Seller, with full cooperation
from Buyer in  all respects, is able to provide Buyer the  benefit of any
such agreement, contract,  license, lease, easement, right-of-way or 
Permit.   (iii) Transition Services Agreement. In the event  Buyer and
Seller agree that transition services will be  necessary after the Closing,
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate  in good faith to execute and deliver at the
Closing a  Transition Services Agreement substantially in the form  attached
hereto as Exhibit D (the "Transition Services  Agreement"). Promptly
following the execution of this  Agreement, representatives of Buyer and
Seller shall meet to  develop a transition plan which shall identify
services,  service periods (not to exceed six (6) months) and service 
charges to be provided pursuant to the terms and conditions of  the
Transition Services Agreement and which will, to the  extent practicable, be
completed prior to the       26    Closing. Such services may include
any technical and/or  managerial support required to operate the
Business.   (iv) Other Governmental Approvals. Buyer and Seller  shall
cooperate with each other and take all reasonable steps  necessary to obtain
authorization for the sale of the Pipeline  Interest from all other
applicable governmental authorities.   (v) Other Actions. Buyer and Seller
shall otherwise  use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cause  the satisfaction of all conditions precedent in this Section  10 and
Sections 12 and 13 and the Closing to occur as soon as  reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement.   11. EMPLOYEES.   (a)
Employees. Schedule 11(a) attached hereto contains a list  of all employees
of Seller or other members of the BP Group directly  employed in the
operation of the Pipeline Interest (collectively, the  "Employees"),
including employees who are receiving short-term  disability benefits or are
on family and medical, medical/long-term  disability, administrative, or
military leave or any other type of  leave that entitles the Employee to
reinstatement upon completion of  the leave under the applicable leave
policies of Seller or other  members of the BP Group (collectively, "Leave").
Seller shall be  entitled to update Schedule 11(a) as necessary at any time
prior to  Closing to reflect any and all employment changes.   (b)
Employment Offers to Active Employees. No later than ten  (10) days after the
date of this Agreement (and not later than three  (3) days after any update
of Schedule 11(a)), Buyer shall offer  employment with Buyer, effective as of
the Closing Date, to all active  Employees, at the same or better salaries or
wages, with similar duties  and responsibilities, at the same location and on
the same status  (e.g., full-time or part-time) as provided by Seller or
other members  of the BP Group immediately prior to the Closing Date. All
Employees  who accept employment with Buyer pursuant to the offers
described  either in this Section 11(b) or in Section 11(c) are referred to
herein  as "Transferred Employees." Buyer shall not reduce any Transferred 
Employee\'s initial salary or wages as an employee of Buyer during the 
12-month period after the Closing Date. Buyer will give each active  Employee
no less than seven (7) days in which to accept or reject  Buyer\'s employment
offer.   (c) Employment Offers to Employees on Leave. In addition, no 
later than ten (10) days after the date of this Agreement, Buyer shall  offer
employment with Buyer to each Employee who is on Leave as of the  Closing
Date, commencing at such time as such Employee is ready to  return to work,
at the same or better salaries or wages, with similar  duties and
responsibilities, at the same location and on the same  status, (e.g., full-
time or part-time) as provided by Seller or other  members of the BP Group
immediately prior to the commencement of such  Employee\'s Leave; provided,
however, that such Employee is ready to  return to work within one hundred
twenty (120) days after the Closing  Date. Buyer will give each Employee on
Leave no less than seven (7)  days in which to accept or reject Buyer\'s
employment offer.       27    (d) Transfer Time. All Transferred
Employees shall become  employees of Buyer as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time, on
the Closing Date  and except as otherwise provided herein, at such time,
Buyer shall  assume and be responsible for payment of all salaries and
benefits and  all other costs and liabilities relating to the Transferred
Employees  except that with regard to an Employee on Leave, such obligations
shall  not attach until the Employee on Leave commences employment with
Buyer.   (e) Level of Employee Benefits Provided by Buyer. Buyer shall 
provide to all Transferred Employees employee benefits in accordance  with
employee benefit plans (such as defined benefit plans, defined  contribution
plans and welfare benefit plans), programs, policies and  pay practices (such
as vacations, bonuses and short-term disability  leaves) which shall be the
same as or better than the benefits provided  to substantially similar
employees of Buyer. No later than the Closing  Date, Seller will provide to
Buyer the Transferred Employees\'  recognized credited service, and
participation, vesting and, as  applicable, benefit accrual periods of
service amounts, with Seller or  other members of the BP Group as of the day
immediately prior to the  Closing Date.   (f) Pension Plans. Buyer agrees
that, effective as of the  Closing Date, Buyer will sponsor a defined benefit
pension plan ("Buyer  Pension Plan"), as defined under Section 3(35) of the
Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended with respect
to  Transferred Employees who participate in the BP Retirement Accumulation 
Plan ("BP RAP") prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer Pension Plan will 
provide that (i) such Transferred Employees will be eligible to  participate
in the Buyer Pension Plan as of the Closing Date and (ii)  such Transferred
Employees will be given service credit equal to the  number of years of
participation and vesting periods of service such  Transferred Employees have
under the BP RAP. The Buyer Pension Plan  also will grant service for benefit
accrual service equal to the number  of years of benefit accrual service for
those Transferred Employees who  have an accrued benefit in the BP RAP and
may provide that the age 65  single life annuity payable to Transferred
Employees under the Buyer  Pension Plan may be offset by the amount of the
age 65 single life  annuity payable to such Transferred Employees under the
BP RAP. In no  event shall the age 65 single life benefit accrued under the
Buyer  Pension Plan for Transferred Employees be less than the benefit such 
Transferred Employees would receive if only service with Buyer were 
recognized under the Buyer Pension Plan. The Buyer Pension Plan may  include
such other terms and provisions as shall be determined by Buyer  in its sole
discretion to the extent not inconsistent with this Section  11(f). Seller
agrees to furnish on a timely basis such information with  regard to benefits
payable to Transferred Employees under the BP RAP  and such other information
as Buyer may from time to time, within one  (1) year after the Closing Date,
reasonably request for purposes of  complying with this Section 11(f).  
(g) Defined Contribution Pension Plans. Buyer agrees that,  effective as of
the Closing Date, Buyer\'s defined contribution pension  plans that
Transferred Employees participate in shall be amended to  recognize such
Transferred Employees\' participation and vesting periods  of service with
Seller and other members of the BP Group for purposes  of determining
participation, vesting and the level of company  contributions.      
28    (h) Welfare Benefits and Other Benefits and Policies. For each 
Transferred Employee who participates in any welfare benefit plan, or  is
subject to any policy or pay practice, of Buyer, both Buyer and the 
applicable welfare benefit, policy and pay practice (i) shall recognize  the
Transferred Employee\'s recognized credited service amounts with  Seller and
other members of the BP Group for all purposes including  eligibility,
vesting, and benefit determination and accrual; (ii) shall  not require a
physical examination or other proof of insurability, and  shall waive all
coverage exclusions and limitations relating to waiting  periods or pre-
existing conditions, with respect to any of the  Transferred Employees or any
dependent covered by Seller\'s and other  members of the BP Group\'s
comparable welfare benefit plan, policy or  pay practice in effect as of the
Closing Date; and (iii) shall credit  the expenses of the Transferred
Employees which were credited toward  2001 deductibles or co-payments under
the applicable welfare benefit  plan of Seller or other members of the BP
Group against satisfaction of  any 2001 deductibles or co-payments under
Buyer\'s medical welfare  benefit plan for the Transferred Employees.   (i)
Vacation. Seller shall be responsible for paying the  Transferred Employees
for any vacation due as of the Closing Date under  the applicable vacation
policy of Seller or other members of the BP  Group (the "Seller Vacation
Policy"). Buyer will provide Transferred  Employees who, based upon the
recognized credited service amounts of  such Transferred Employees with
Seller or other members of the BP  Group, were eligible for a greater amount
of annual vacation under the  Seller Vacation Policy than they are under
Buyer\'s vacation policy even  after Buyer recognizes such Transferred
Employees\' credited service  amounts, with their Seller annual vacation
amount. Between the Closing  Date and the end of the year in which the
Closing occurs, Buyer shall  permit all Transferred Employees to take the
same number of days of  vacation on an unpaid basis as they would have been
eligible to take  immediately prior to the Closing Date under the Seller

Transferred  Employees with Seller or other members of the BP Group.   (j)
Severance. Buyer shall establish a severance policy  substantially similar to
the 2001 BP Severance Benefits Plan (the "BP  Severance Plan"), with respect
to any Transferred Employee who has  actions taken against such Transferred
Employee within eighteen (18)  months after the Closing Date that would make
the Transferred Employee  eligible for severance benefits under the
involuntary terminations  section of the BP Severance Plan. Buyer\'s
severance policy established  under this Section 11(j) shall recognize the
Transferred Employees\'  recognized credited service amounts with Seller or
other members of the  BP Group.   (k) WARN Act. Buyer represents and
warrants to, and covenants  with, Seller that there will be no major

similar  provision of any federal, state, regional, foreign or local law,
rule  or regulation (collectively, "WARN Obligations"). To the extent that 
any WARN Obligations might arise as a consequence of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for, and 
shall       29    indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties against
any Losses caused by,  arising from, incurred in connection with or relating
in any way to,  any WARN Obligations arising as a result of any employment
losses  occurring on or after the Closing Date. For ninety (90) days
following  the Closing Date, Buyer shall not engage in any mass layoff,
plant  closing or other action that might trigger WARN Obligations of
Seller  or any other member of the BP Group.   (l) Service Credit. From and
after the Closing Date, the  Transferred Employees shall be given credit for
their service  recognized by Seller or other members of the BP Group prior to
the  Closing Date for all purposes, including eligibility, vesting and 
benefit determination and accrual under all applicable plans and  programs of
Buyer, as well as for purposes of determining any vacation,  severance or
other related benefits to be provided pursuant to the  manner described

and hold  harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against any  and
all Losses of any kind which are caused by, arise from,  are incurred in
connection with or relate in any way to (A) a  breach       33    of
Seller\'s representations and warranties in Section 7, and  (B) the Excluded

and   (ii) Buyer shall assume responsibility for, and shall  indemnify,

relating to or otherwise required or incurred to  achieve or maintain
compliance with Health, Safety and  Environmental Laws, as the same are in
effect from time to  time, irrespective of whether the events giving rise to
such  liabilities occurred prior to, on or after the Closing Date, 
including any and all Losses of any kind which are caused by,  arise from,
are incurred in connection with or relate in any  way to Asbestos-Related
Liabilities or the Disclosed  Environmental Liabilities and (B) any and all
Losses that are  caused by or result or arise from changes in, modifications
to  or amendments of Health, Safety and Environmental Laws that  were in
effect prior to the Closing Date or promulgated, made  or enacted on or after
the Closing Date;   provided, however, that Seller shall not have any
liability  under clause (i) above for any breach of a representation or 
warranty contained in this Agreement or the other agreements  contemplated
hereby if Buyer had knowledge of such breach at  the time of Closing and
failed to notify Seller of such breach  in accordance with Section 10(b)(ii),
and no Losses caused by,  arising from, incurred in connection with or
related in any  way thereto shall be aggregated for purposes of Section
15(j).   (d) Exclusive Remedy. Any claim or cause of action based on, 
arising out of or relating in any way to any of the transactions 
contemplated under this Agreement (including all Exhibits and Schedules 
attached hereto or referenced herein) must be brought by either party  in
accordance with the provisions and limitations of this Agreement,  whether
such claim arises out of any contract, tort or otherwise.  Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the parties hereby  waive to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all  rights, claims
and causes of action they may have against each other  relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the other  agreements contemplated
hereby arising under or based on any federal,  state, provincial, local or
foreign statute, law, ordinance, rule or  regulation or otherwise, including
such rights, claims and causes of  action Buyer may have against Seller under
CERCLA, breaches of  statutory or implied warranties or otherwise, nuisance
or other tort  actions, and common law rights of contribution. Without
limiting the  generality of the foregoing, Buyer understands and agrees that
the  rights accorded under this Section 15 are the sole and exclusive
remedy  of Buyer against Seller or any other member of the BP Group with 
respect to any matters relating to Health, Safety and Environmental  Laws.
Buyer hereby waives any right to seek contribution or other  recovery from
Seller or any other member of the BP Group under such  Health, Safety and
Environmental Laws, and Buyer hereby releases Seller  and the other members
of the BP Group from any claims, demands or  causes of action that Buyer has
or may have in the future against  Seller and/or       34    the
other members of the BP Group under Health, Safety and  Environmental Laws.
Buyer further acknowledges and agrees that, (A)  other than the
representations and warranties of Seller specifically  contained in this
Agreement, there are no representations or warranties  of Seller, any other
member of the BP Group or their respective  directors, officers, employees,
shareholders, partners, counsel,  auditors, accountants, agents, advisors or
other representatives or any  other Person either express or implied with
respect to any of them, the  Pipeline Interest, the Purchased Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities and  (B) it shall have no claim or right to
indemnification with respect to  any information, documents or materials
furnished by Seller, any other  member of the BP Group or their respective
directors, officers,  employees, shareholders, partners, counsel, auditors,
accountants,  agents, advisors or other representatives or any other Person
or any of  their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, partners,
counsel,  auditors, accountants, agents, advisors or other representatives, 
including the Offering Memorandum and any information, documents or  material
made available to Buyer in certain "data rooms," management  presentations or
any other form in expectation of the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.   (e) Procedures Relating to Indemnification Among Buyer and 
Seller. Following the discovery of any facts or conditions which could 
reasonably be expected to give rise to a Loss or Losses for which 
indemnification is provided under this Agreement, the party seeking 
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall, as promptly as  reasonably
possible thereafter, provide written notice to the party  from whom
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party"), setting  forth the
specific facts and circumstances, in reasonable detail,  relating to such
Loss or Losses and the amount of Loss or Losses (or a  reasonable, good-faith
estimate thereof if the actual amount is not  known or not capable of
reasonable calculation) ("Indemnification  Notice"); provided, however, that
failure to give such Indemnification  Notice on a timely basis shall not
affect the indemnification provided  hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been  actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure.  Notwithstanding the foregoing:   (i) a Buyer
Indemnified Party shall not be entitled  to make a claim against Seller under
Section 15(b)(ii) unless  and until (A) Buyer shall have provided Seller
written notice  of such default; and (B) Seller shall have failed to cure
such  default within sixty (60) days after Seller\'s receipt of  Buyer\'s
notice; and   (ii) a Seller Indemnified Party shall not be entitled  to
make a claim against Buyer under Section 15(a)(iii) unless  and until (A)
Seller shall have provided Buyer written notice  of default; and (B) Buyer
shall have failed to cure such  default within sixty (60) days after Buyer\'s
receipt of  Seller\'s notice.   (f) Procedures Relating to Indemnification
for Third Party  Claims.   (i) In order for an Indemnified Party to be
entitled  to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement in 
respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made  by any Person
against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party  Claim"), such Indemnified
Party must provide an  Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying Party of
the Third  Party Claim as promptly as reasonably possible after      
35    receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party 
Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the  Indemnifying
Party, within five (5) business days after the  Indemnified Party\'s receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and  documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified  Party relating to the Third Party Claim;
provided, however,  that failure to provide an Indemnification Notice, or
deliver  copies of all notices and documents, on a timely manner shall  not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to  the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually  prejudiced as a result of such
failure.   (ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an  Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to  participate in the
defense thereof and, if it so chooses and  acknowledges its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party  therefor, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel selected  by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to
the  Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding any acknowledgment made  pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, the  Indemnifying Party shall continue to
be entitled to assert any  limitation on its indemnification responsibility
contained in  Sections 15(j) and 15(k). Should the Indemnifying Party so 
elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the  Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable to the Indemnified  Party for legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the  Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof.
If  the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnified  Party
shall have the right to participate in the defense  thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate  from the counsel employed by the
Indemnifying Party, it being  understood, however, that the Indemnifying
Party shall control  such defense. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
the  fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party  for any
period during which the Indemnifying Party has not  assumed the defense
thereof. If the Indemnifying Party chooses  to defend any Third Party Claim,
all the parties hereto shall  cooperate in the defense or prosecution of such
Third Party  Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon 
the Indemnifying Party\'s request) the provision to the  Indemnifying Party
of records and information which are  reasonably relevant to such Third Party
Claim, and making  employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide  additional information and explanation of any material  provided
hereunder. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party  shall have assumed the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the  Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect  to, or settle, compromise or discharge, or consent to
the  entry of any judgment with respect to, such Third Party Claim  without
the Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent (which  consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld)   (g) Losses Net of Insurance and Taxes. The amount
of any and  all Losses under this Section 15 and elsewhere under this
Agreement  shall be determined net of any amounts recovered or recoverable by
the  Indemnified Party under insurance policies, indemnities, or other 
reimbursement arrangements with respect to such Losses. Each party  hereby
waives, or will procure the waiver of, any subrogation rights  that its
insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. The  amount of any
and all Losses shall be reduced by the amount of any net  reduction in cash
Tax payable by the Indemnified Party with respect to       36    such
Losses through and including the Tax year in which the  indemnification
payment is made. Any indemnity payment under this  Agreement shall be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for  tax purposes.   (h) Attorneys\'
Fees. In connection with any litigation arising  out of this Agreement or to
enforce any indemnification claim pursuant  to this Agreement, the prevailing
party shall be entitled to recover  from the nonprevailing party its
reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs,  on appeal or otherwise.   (i) Time
Limitation. Except as otherwise provided herein, any  claim by any Buyer
Indemnified Party for indemnity arising under this  Agreement, including
pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 15(c), shall be  brought within two (2) years
after the Closing Date. A claim shall be  deemed to have been brought only
upon delivery of a proper  Indemnification Notice to the other party at the
notice address set  forth in Section 20. Any claim required to be made within
such two (2)  year period not so timely made shall be forever barred.   (j)
Monetary Limitation. Buyer shall have no claim under this  Agreement against
Seller or any other member of the BP Group for any  Losses unless and until
the aggregate of all such Losses incurred or  sustained by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties exceeds Two Million Five  Hundred Thousand Dollars
($2,500,000) and then only for the excess over  Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000) (the  "Threshold"); provided that Losses
amounting to less than Two Hundred  Thousand Fifty Dollars ($250,000) in the
aggregate arising out of the  same occurrence or matter shall not be
aggregated with other Losses for  purposes of determining whether and when
the Threshold has been  reached. After the Threshold has been reached, Seller
shall have no  obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under
this  Agreement with respect to such matters for any Losses amounting to
less  than Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) in the aggregate 
arising out of the same occurrence or matter. For purposes of this  Section
15(j), Losses shall exclude Remediation Losses and  Rights-of-Way Losses,
which are addressed in Section 15(l) and 15(m),  respectively, below.   (k)
Limitation of Liability. Seller\'s aggregate liability for  Indemnification
pursuant to this Agreement, including Section 15(b) and  (c) shall in no
event exceed an amount equal to Thirty One Million Five  Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($31,500,000).   (l) Environmental Remediation Monetary
Limitation.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer
shall have  no claim under this Agreement against Seller or any other member
of the  BP Group for any Remediation Losses by Seller or other members of
the  BP Group unless and until the aggregate of all such Remediation Losses 
incurred or sustained by the Buyer Indemnified Parties exceeds Two  Million
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000), and then only for  the excess
over Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,500,000)  (the "First
Threshold"). After the First Threshold has been reached,  Buyer shall only
have a claim under this Agreement against Seller for  fifty percent (50%) of
the excess of any Remediation Losses incurred or  sustained by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties over the First Threshold  unless and until the aggregate
of all such Remediation Losses incurred  or sustained by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties exceeds Five       37    Million Dollars
($5,000,000) (the "Second Threshold"). Thereafter,  subject to Sections 15(j)
and 15(k), Buyer shall have a claim under  this Agreement against Seller for
100% of the excess of Remediation  Losses over the Second Threshold.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller  shall have no obligation to indemnify
the Buyer Indemnified Parties  under this Agreement with respect to such
matters for any Remediation  Losses amounting to less than Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars  ($250,000) in the aggregate arising out of the same
occurrence or  matter.   (m) Rights-of-Way Monetary Limitation.
Notwithstanding any  other provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall have no
claim under this  Agreement against Seller or any other member of the BP
Group for any  Rights-of-Way Losses unless and until the aggregate of all
such  Rights-of-Way Losses incurred or sustained by the Buyer Indemnified 
Parties exceeds Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), and then only for the 
excess over Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (the "Level 1 Threshold"). 
After the Level 1 Threshold has been reached, Buyer shall only have a  claim
under this Agreement against Seller for fifty percent (50%) of  the excess of
any Rights-of-Way Losses incurred or sustained by the  Buyer Indemnified
Parties over the Level 1 Threshold unless and until  the aggregate of all
such Rights-of-Way Losses incurred or sustained by  the Buyer Indemnified
Parties exceeds Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000)  (the "Level 2 Threshold").
Thereafter, subject only to Section 15(k),  Buyer shall have a claim under
this Agreement against Seller for 100%  of the excess of Rights-of-Way Losses
over the Level 2 Threshold.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have
no obligation to  indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties under this
Agreement with  respect to such matters for any Rights-of-Way Losses
amounting to less  than One Hundred Seventy Fifty Thousand Dollars ($175,000)
in the  aggregate arising out of the same occurrence or matter.   (n)
Mitigation. Each party hereto shall take all reasonable  steps and use all
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any and  all Losses.   (o)
Losses. As used in this Agreement, "Losses" means any and  all costs, claims,
losses, liabilities, obligations (including  corrective and remedial
obligations), damages and expenses (including  reasonable legal fees and
expenses but excluding any liability relating  to consequential damages, lost
profits or punitive damages).   16. TAXES   (a) Except as provided in this
Section 16, Buyer shall be  liable for and pay all Taxes, utility charges or
apportionments which  arise as a result of this Agreement or the consummation
of the  transactions contemplated hereby or as a result of any purchase,
sale,  rental, lease, storage, use, consumption or operation of the
Purchased  Assets by Buyer. Seller agrees to cooperate with and assist Buyer
in  claiming any applicable occasional sale or sales tax exemption; 
provided that Seller shall not incur any unreimbursed third-party  costs,
expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of or in any way  relating to, the
provision of such assistance.       38    (b) General and special
real estate and other ad valorem taxes  and assessments and other state or
local taxes, fees, charges and  assessments in respect of real property on
the basis of the fiscal year  in which the Closing occurs shall be prorated
between Buyer and Seller  as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time, on the Closing
Date. If the Closing  Date shall occur before the tax rate or assessment is
fixed for such  fiscal year, the apportionment of such taxes and payments at
the  Closing shall be based upon the most recently ascertainable tax bills; 
provided, that Buyer and Seller shall recalculate and re-prorate said  taxes
and payments and make the necessary cash adjustments promptly  upon the
issuance, and on the basis, of the actual tax bills received  for the fiscal
year in which the Closing occurs and the amount of any  payments in lieu of
tax made with respect to any such fiscal year.   (c) Personal property
taxes, if any, on the basis of the  fiscal year in which the Closing occurs
shall be prorated between Buyer  and Seller as of 12:01 a.m., Central Time,
on the Closing Date. If the  Closing Date shall occur before the tax rate or
assessment is fixed for  such fiscal year, the apportionment of such taxes at
the Closing shall  be based upon a reasonable estimate mutually agreed upon
by Buyer and  Seller; provided, that Buyer and Seller shall recalculate and 
re-prorate said taxes and make the necessary cash adjustments promptly  upon
the issuance of, and on the basis of, the actual tax bills  received for such
fiscal year.   17. RECORDS/LITIGATION ASSISTANCE.   (a) For a period of
seven (7) years following the Closing  Date, Buyer shall provide to Seller
and other members of the BP Group  (and their counsel, auditors, accountants,
agents, advisors or other  representatives) reasonable access to and
permission to take copies of  any books, records or accounts relating to the
Pipeline Interest  through and including the Closing Date; and Buyer shall
not destroy or  dispose of any such books, records and accounts for a period
of at  least seven (7) years after the Closing Date without first offering
to  surrender to Seller such books, records and accounts which Buyer may 
intend to destroy or dispose of. Seller agrees that it will consult  with
Buyer in advance of taking any such actions following the Closing  Date with
a view towards establishing a mutually agreeable plan for  such visits so
that these actions will not unreasonably interfere with  the normal operation
of the Pipeline Interest.   (b) After the Closing Date, each party shall
provide such  assistance as the other party may from time to time reasonably
request  in connection with the preparation of tax returns required to be
filed,  any audit or other examination by any taxing authority, any judicial
or  administrative proceeding relating to liability for taxes, or any claim 
for refund in respect of such Taxes or in connection with any  litigation and
proceedings or liabilities related to the Pipeline  Interest, including
making available employees for interviews,  litigation preparation and
testimony. The requesting party shall  reimburse the assisting party for the
out-of-pocket costs incurred by  the assisting party.   (c) If Buyer, as a
result of the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement, at any time
within twelve (12) months after the Closing  Date, is required to file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission  financial statements relating to the
Pipeline Interest,       39    Seller shall provide such assistance
as Buyer may reasonably request in  connection with the preparation of such
financial statements, including  providing to Buyer Seller\'s books, records
or accounts relating to the  Pipeline Interest and relevant personnel
relating to the Pipeline  Interest and access to Seller\'s independent
auditors from the date  hereof through and including the Closing Date and for
a period of  twelve (12) months thereafter; provided that Seller shall not
incur any  unreimbursed third-party costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as
a  result of or in any way relating to, the provision of such assistance.  
18. TERMINATION RIGHTS.   (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the  Closing Date as follows and in no other manner:   (i) by
mutual written consent of Buyer and Seller;   (ii) by Buyer, if any of the
conditions set forth in  Section 12 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment, and  shall not have been waived by Buyer (provided, however,
that  Buyer is not in material breach of its representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this  Agreement, except with respect to
the fulfillment of the  conditions set forth in Section 12(e) for which the
material  breach of Buyer\'s representations, warranties, covenants or 
agreements contained herein shall be ignored);   (iii) by Seller, if any of
the conditions set forth  in Section 13 shall have become incapable of
fulfillment, and  shall not have been waived by Seller (provided, however,
that  Seller is not in material breach of its representations,  warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this  Agreement);   (iv) by Seller, if
the Closing does not occur on or  prior to February 1, 2002;   (v) by
Buyer, if the Closing does not occur on or  prior to February 1, 2002;
provided, however, that, in the  event that all conditions of Section 12
other than termination  or expiration of the waiting period under the HSR Act
and the  issuance of Final Orders by the Public Service Commission of  North
Dakota are satisfied, then Buyer may not terminate under  this clause (v)
until June 30, 2002; or   (vi) by Buyer, if a Deposit Return Event
occurs.   (b) In the event of termination by Buyer or Seller pursuant to 
this Section 18, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the 
other party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall  be
terminated, without further action by any party. If the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement are terminated as provided herein:      
40    (i) Buyer shall return to Seller all documents and  copies and other
materials received from or on behalf of  Seller relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby,  whether so obtained before or after the execution
hereof; and   (ii) all confidential information received by Buyer  with
respect to the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities  and the Pipeline
Interest shall be treated in accordance with  the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement,  which shall remain in full force and effect
notwithstanding  the termination of this Agreement.   (c) If this Agreement
is terminated and the transactions  contemplated hereby are abandoned as
described in this Section 18, this  Agreement shall become void and of no
further force and effect, except  for the provisions of:   (i) Section
10(b)(i) relating to the obligation of  Buyer to keep confidential certain
information and data  obtained by it;   (ii) Section 22 relating to
publicity;   (iii) Section 10(a)(i) relating to indemnification in 
connection with the matters contemplated thereby;   (iv) Section 27 relating
to certain expenses;   (v) Sections 6(f) and 9(f) relating to finder\'s
fees  and broker\'s fees; and   (vi) this Section 18.   Nothing in this
Section 18 shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any
breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to
impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by another party
of its obligations under this Agreement.   19. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Each
party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the other party would be damaged
irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are breached.

to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and

matter (subject to the provisions set forth in Section 21 below), in addition
to any other remedy to which they may be entitled, at law or in
equity.       41    20. NOTICES.   (a) All notices or other

JURISDICTION. This Agreement and the obligations of the parties hereunder
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the
substantive and procedural laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to

Agreement.   22. PUBLICITY. Buyer and Seller agree that, from the date
hereof through and including the Closing Date, no public release or
announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued
or made by any party hereto (including any member of the BP Group) without
the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), except (a) as such release or announcement may be required by law
or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, whether in the United
States, United Kingdom or elsewhere, (or in the opinion of counsel such
release or announcement is appropriate or desirable under or in light of such
laws and regulations), in which case the party making the release or
announcement shall allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and (b) that any member
of the BP Group, including Seller, may make such an announcement to its
employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate to
prepare a joint press release to be issued on the Closing Date and, upon the
request of either Buyer or Seller, at the time of the signing of this
Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential, except to the extent required by applicable law or
for financial reporting purposes and except that the parties may disclose
such terms to their respective (and in the case of Seller, the BP Group\'s)
counsel, auditors, accountants, agents, advisors and other representatives as
necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential).   23. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.
The covenants and representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any
other document delivered in connection herewith shall survive the Closing
solely for purposes of Sections 15(a) and 15(b). The representations and
warranties in this Agreement shall terminate at the close of business on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that the
representations and warranties provided in Section 6(e) with respect to the
Pipeline Real Property shall not survive and shall terminate at the
Closing.   24. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement, the attached Schedules
and Exhibits and the agreements referred to herein or executed
simultaneously herewith, set forth the entire agreement and understanding of
the parties in respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
and supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and undertakings, whether
written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof (other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall continue in effect). No
representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention, whether
written or oral, has been made by any party which is not embodied in or
superseded by this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or in the
documents referred to herein, and no party shall be bound by or liable for
any alleged representation, promise, inducement or statement of intention not
so set forth whether in the Offering Memorandum, in certain "data rooms,"
management presentations or any other form in expectation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as otherwise specifically      
43   provided in this Agreement, no conditions, usage of trade, course of
dealing or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify,
vary, explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement will be
binding unless hereafter made in writing and signed by the party to be bound,
and no modification will be effected by the acknowledgment or acceptance of
documents containing terms or conditions at variance with or in addition to
those set forth in this Agreement, except as otherwise specifically agreed to
by the parties in writing.   25. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement and any rights
and obligations hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by Buyer or
Seller (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or sale of
stock, or sale of substantially all the assets, of Buyer or Seller) without
the prior written consent of the other party and any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void and without effect; provided, however,
that each of Buyer and Seller may (a) assign any and all of its rights and
interests hereunder to one or more of its affiliates and (b) designate one or
more of its affiliates to perform its obligations hereunder; provided further
that each of Buyer and Seller shall remain responsible for the performance of
all of its respective obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller may assign or transfer any or all of its rights hereunder to any
qualified intermediary in order to complete an exchange of like-kind property
under Section 1031 of the Code and, at the request of Seller, Buyer shall
execute such agreements and other documents as may be necessary, in the
reasonable opinion of Seller\'s counsel, to complete and otherwise effectuate
Seller\'s exchange of properties in accordance with said Section 1031 of the
Code and the regulations thereunder; provided that Buyer shall not incur any
unreimbursed third party costs, expenses, fees or liabilities as a result of
or connected with the exchange.   26. AMENDMENT AND WAIVER. This Agreement
may be amended, modified, superseded or canceled, and any of the terms,
covenants, representations, warranties or conditions hereof may be waived,
only by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto, or, in the case
of a waiver, by or on behalf of the party waiving compliance. The failure of
any party at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof
shall in no manner affect the right at a later time to enforce the same. No
waiver by any party of any condition, or of any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such condition or breach or a waiver of any other condition or
of any breach of any other term, covenant representation or warranty. No
course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this
Agreement shall be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of
this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason
of this Agreement.   27. EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, and except as otherwise specifically
provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
legal, due diligence, accounting and investment banking fees and expenses,
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses.      
44    28. HEADINGS. The section and paragraph headings contained in
this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in any way
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   29. COUNTERPARTS.
This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in one or more counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages), all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or
more such counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other party.   30. INTERPRETATION. Unless the context requires
otherwise:   (a) this Agreement includes this Asset Purchase Agreement and 
any other agreement entered into by Buyer and Seller on the Closing  Date or
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby;   (b) the singular
shall include the plural and the plural shall  include the singular and any
gender shall include all other genders all  as the meaning and the context of
the Agreement shall require;   (c) references to Sections and paragraphs
refer to sections  and paragraphs, respectively, of this Agreement;   (d)
references to Exhibits and Schedules are to exhibits and  schedules attached
to this Agreement, each of which is hereby  incorporated and made a part of
this Agreement for all purposes as if  set forth in full herein;   (e) the
words "including," "include," "includes" and all  variants thereof mean
"including, without limitation;" and   (f) all references to "Dollars" and
"dollars" in this  Agreement are to United States dollars.   31. NO STRICT
CONSTRUCTION. Notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement has been drafted
or prepared by one of the parties, Buyer and Seller confirm that both they
and their respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this
Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the parties, and the
language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by
the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any Person.   32. SCHEDULES. The
disclosures in the schedules hereto (including any disclosures made in
amendments made pursuant to Section 10(a)(iii)) (the "Schedules") are to be
taken as relating to the representations and warranties of Seller as a whole.
Matters listed once on the Schedules shall be deemed disclosed with reference
to all sections of the Schedules and all of Sections 6 and 7 of this
Agreement. The inclusion of information in the Schedules hereto shall not be
construed as an admission that such information is material to the Pipeline
Interest, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or Seller.
In addition, matters reflected in the Schedules are not      
45   necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in such Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall have the right at all
times to supplement, modify or update the Schedules hereto; provided,
however, that any such supplements, modifications or updates shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 10(a)(iii). The Schedules are incorporated
herein by reference and made a part hereof.   33. REPRESENTATION BY
COUNSEL; INTERPRETATION. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that each of them has
been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the party that drafted it has no application and is
expressly waived.   34. SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be valid and
effective under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision hereof.   35. BULK TRANSFER LAWS. Buyer hereby
waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of any so-called bulk
transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the purchase and sale of
the Purchased Assets. Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any
Losses which Buyer may incur due to failure to so comply in accordance with
Section 15.   36. NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES. Except as provided with
respect to indemnification as set forth in Section 15 and elsewhere in this
Agreement, nothing in this Agreement shall confer any rights upon any Person
other than the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns.   37. DEFINITION OF AFFILIATE. As used herein, the term
"affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 405 promulgated under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   38. TIME OF ESSENCE. With regard
to all rights and obligations of the parties and all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.   39.
NO CONDITIONS. For the avoidance of doubt, the only conditions to closing are
those set forth in Sections 12 and 13 herein, and no other covenants or
conditions set forth in this Agreement are intended to have any effect on
the Closing or the payment of the Purchase Price.   ****
