-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of December 21,
2007, by and among BAE Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Mira Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and MTC Technologies, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company each have approved, and in the case of the Company and Merger Sub deem
it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders to
consummate, the acquisition of the Company by Parent by means of a merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding
share of the Companys Common Stock (such issued and outstanding shares of
the Companys Common Stock, collectively, the " _Shares_ "), other than
Dissenting Shares, Shares owned by Parent or any wholly-owned Subsidiaries
of Parent or the Company, and any shares of Common Stock held in the treasury
of the Company, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration; and

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
Rajesh K. Soin and a stockholder affiliated with him are entering into an
agreement with Parent in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ attached
hereto, pursuant to which Rajesh K. Soin and such stockholder shall agree to
take certain actions to support the Transactions (the " _Stockholder Voting
Agreement_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
will be merged with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as
the surviving corporation. The Company as the surviving corporation after the
Merger is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Surviving Corporation_."

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m. on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or
waiver of all of the conditions (other than any condition that by its nature
cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of any such
condition) set forth in _Article VII_ (the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices
of Jones Day, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44114, unless
another date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties to this
Agreement. Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. The parties to this Agreement shall cause the
Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date (or on such other date as
Parent and the Company may agree) with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed
to by Parent and the Company, being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4  _Effect of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises and
authority of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall be amended so as to read in its entirety in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , and, as so amended, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company
shall be amended so as to read in their entirety in the form attached hereto
as  _Exhibit C_ , and, as so amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The
directors of Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time will be the
initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and the officers of Merger Sub
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of Shares or securities of Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time
(other than any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and any
Dissenting Shares) will be cancelled and extinguished and be converted into
the right to receive $24.00 in cash payable to the holder of such Share,
without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the
certificate formerly representing such Share (a " _Certificate_ ") in the
manner provided in _Section 2.2_. All such Shares, when so converted, will
no longer be outstanding and will be automatically  



 

-2-  cancelled, retired and cease to exist. Each holder of a Certificate
representing any such Shares will cease to have any rights with respect to
such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such
Shares upon the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with _Section
2.2_, without interest.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or
the Company immediately before the Effective Time will be cancelled and
extinguished, and no payment or other consideration will be made with respect
to such Shares.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time will thereafter
represent one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Payment; Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

(a) Before the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders
of Shares in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") to receive
the funds necessary to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.1(a)_. At
the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, in trust with the Paying Agent in a separate account for the
benefit of holders of Shares (the " _Payment Fund_ ") the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective Time
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. If for any reason the cash in the Payment Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit
cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in
the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than five Business Days following the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates whose shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ (i) a letter
of transmittal (which must specify that delivery will be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and will be in such form and have such other
provisions as the Company and Merger Sub may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of a Certificate or Certificates may thereafter
until the first anniversary of the Effective Time surrender such Certificate
or Certificates to the Paying Agent under cover of the letter of transmittal,
as agent for such holder. Upon delivery of a valid letter of transmittal and
the surrender of Certificates on or before the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall cause the Paying Agent to pay the holder of
such Certificates, in exchange for the Certificates, cash in an amount equal
to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate, without interest. Until so surrendered, each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, Shares held by Parent
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent or the Company,
and Shares held in the treasury of the Company) will represent solely the
right to receive the aggregate Merger Consideration relating to the Shares
represented by such Certificates.



 

-3- (c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of cancelled Shares is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
Certificate is registered, it will be a condition to such payment that the
Certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the satisfaction of Merger Sub that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. The Merger Consideration paid upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to the Shares theretofore represented by such
Certificates.

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be
closed and there will not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of the Companys capital stock thereafter on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates will
cease to have any rights with respect to any Shares, except as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares,
Shares held by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent or the Company, and Shares held in the treasury of the Company) are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, they will be cancelled and exchanged
for Merger Consideration as provided in this  _Article II_. No interest will
accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the surrender of a Certificate or
Certificates which immediately before the Effective Time represented the
Shares.

(e) Promptly following the date which is one year after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any cash, including any interest received with respect to
such cash, and, for the avoidance of doubt, any Certificates or other
documents, in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Transactions_ "), which had been made available to the
Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or
previously delivered to the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, and
thereafter such holders will be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws) only as general
creditors of the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates, without any
interest on such Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be liable to any
holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement to any
holder of Shares, and from amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 2.3_, such
amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of U.S. state, local
or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Options or
RSUs in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.



 

-4- Section 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

(a) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option (the " _Options_ ") to
purchase shares of the Companys Common Stock under a Stock Plan not
previously exercised, whether or not then vested and exercisable, will be
converted into the right to receive, in settlement thereof, a cash payment
equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the per Share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common Stock
subject to such Option and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to such Option; _provided_ that any Option for which the per share exercise
price exceeds the per Share Merger Consideration shall be canceled without
any payment in respect thereof.

(b) At the Effective Time, each holder of a restricted stock unit (a " _RSU_
") under a Stock Plan will be entitled to receive, in settlement thereof, for
each share of the Companys Common Stock subject to such RSU, a cash payment
equal to the Merger Consideration. 

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ shall be subject to
_Section 2.2(f)_ and shall be paid without interest.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain any necessary
consents or releases, if any, from the holders of Options and RSUs under the
Stock Plans and take all such other lawful action as may be necessary (which
include satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, and including adopting any necessary actions or resolutions of
the Company Board or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Stock
Plans) to provide for and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this
_Section 2.3_. Except as otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, (i)
the Stock Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time and (ii) the Company
shall assure that following the Effective Time, no participant in any Stock
Plan shall have any right under any such Stock Plan to acquire the capital
stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause the Transactions,
and any other dispositions of equity interests of the Company (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act to be approved by the Company Board or a committee of two or more non-
employee directors of the Company (as such term is defined in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act). Such approval shall specify: (A) the name
of each officer or director, (B) the number of securities to be disposed of
for each named person, and (C) that the approval is granted for purposes of
exempting the transaction under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and which are held by holders who have not voted in favor of or consented
to the Merger and who are otherwise entitled to demand and have properly
demanded and perfected their rights to be paid the fair value of such Shares
in accordance with, and who comply in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be
entitled to only such rights as  



 

-5-  are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such stockholder of the Company shall fail to perfect or shall effectively
waive, withdraw or lose such stockholders rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL, such stockholders Shares in respect of which the stockholder would
otherwise be entitled to receive fair value under Section 262 of the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, at the Effective Time, into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section
2.1(a)_, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate
or Certificates representing such Shares pursuant to _Section 2.2_.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice received by
the Company of the intent of any holder of Shares to demand appraisal of any
Shares, any written demand for appraisal, any withdrawals thereof and any
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the
Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to the exercise of dissenters rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent
or as otherwise required by an Order, make any payment with respect to any
such exercise of dissenters rights or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.

Section 2.5 _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the
Surviving Corporation, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in
or to be vested in the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

Section 2.6 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this _Article II_.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the letter from the Company, dated the date hereof,
addressed to Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (with
specific reference to the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the
information stated in such letter relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
information set forth in one Section of the Company Disclosure  



 

-6-  Letter shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection to which
its relevance is readily apparent on its face) or in the Company SEC
Documents filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(to the extent the qualifying nature of such disclosure is readily apparent on
its face, but excluding any disclosure in such Company SEC Documents set forth
under the heading "Risk Factors" or the heading "Forward Looking Statements"
or any other disclosures of risks generally faced by participants in the
industry in which the Company operates and descriptions of general risks not
related to specifically disclosed facts or circumstances), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 3.1  _Organization_.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all
requisite corporate or other power and authority and all necessary
governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure (i) other
than in the case of the Company, to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or (ii) to have such power, authority and governmental approvals,
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to
be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company does not own any equity interests in any
corporation or other entity, except for its Subsidiaries.

Section 3.2 _Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Company Action_.

fiduciary of any trust created under any Company Plan, to any material tax or
penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the
sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA or to any liability for breach of

plan without regard to such amendment or termination) to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time.

(l) To the Knowledge of the Company, each Company Plan that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code has been operated in good faith compliance

Section 5.2 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall not, nor

discussions in connection with, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any

Company may, in response to a Company Takeover Proposal that was not solicited
by the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives and
did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section 5.2_, if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor, that the following actions would reasonably be
expected to result in the Company Takeover Proposal becoming a Company
Superior Proposal, provide any non-public information regarding the Company to
the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement substantially similar to, and not less restrictive
of such Person than, the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement and any related agreement shall not contain any
provision calling for a right to negotiate exclusively with the Person making
such Company Takeover Proposal or having the effect of prohibiting the Company
from satisfying any of its obligations under this Agreement, _provided_ , 
_further_ , that all information provided to a third party under this _Section
5.2_ is provided or made available on a prior or substantially concurrent
basis to Parent and Merger Sub if such information has not previously
been provided to Parent or Merger Sub) or engage in any negotiations or
discussions with such Person regarding any Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations by the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any
Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any parties (other than
Parent and Merger Sub) conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing and request from each Person that has executed a confidentiality
agreement with the Company the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such Person or its
Representatives and terminate access by each such Person and its
Representatives to any online or other data rooms containing any information
in respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. It is understood that
any  



 

-30-  violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 5.2(a)_ by any
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to
be a breach of this _Section 5.2(a)_ by the Company. Neither the Company nor
the Company Board shall approve, or take any action to render Section 203 of
the DGCL or any similar takeover statute inapplicable to, any Company
Takeover Proposal other than in connection with entering into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal to the extent permitted
under Section 5.2(b)).

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Recommendation or its approval of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, (ii) recommend that the Companys stockholders reject adoption
of this Agreement, (iii) determine that this Agreement and the Transactions
are no longer fair to and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders
or declare that this Agreement is no longer advisable, (iv) approve or
recommend any Company Takeover Proposal or (v) resolve, agree or publicly
propose to take any such actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
after the date hereof and prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Approval,
(x) in response to a Company Superior Proposal which was not solicited by the
Company or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives and did not otherwise result from a breach of this _Section
5.2_, the Company Board may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_ in order to cause the Company to concurrently enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal and (y) the Company
Board may withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company
Recommendation, in each case, only (A) if and to the extent that the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and
its financial advisor, that failing to take any such action would result in a
breach of the fiduciary duties of the Company Board and (B) at a time that is
after the fourth Business Day following the Companys delivery to Parent of
written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to take such
action, specifying, in the case of clause (x), the terms and conditions of
such Company Superior Proposal, including the identity of the Person making
the Company Superior Proposal and, in the case of clause (y), reasonable
details regarding the cause for, and nature of, the withdrawal or modification
of the Company Recommendation; _provided_ that (I) any amendment to the
financial terms or any other material term of any applicable Company Takeover
Proposal or Company Superior Proposal shall require a new written notice by
the Company and a new three Business Day period, and no such termination of
this Agreement by the Company or withdrawal or modification of the Company
Recommendation may be made during any such three Business Day period, (II) the
Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during
such four or three Business Day period described above, negotiate with Parent
and Merger Sub in good faith, to the extent Parent and Merger Sub desire to
negotiate, to make such changes in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Company Takeover Proposal ceases to constitute a Company Superior
Proposal or that the cause for such withdrawal or modification of the Company
Recommendation ceases to exist, (III) the Company Board shall take into
account any changes to the financial and other terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to any such written notice by the Company or
otherwise and (IV) the requirements for terminating this Agreement and
withdrawing or modifying the Company Recommendation are still satisfied at
the time this Agreement is terminated or at the time of such withdrawal or
modification of the Company Recommendation.

(c) The Company shall promptly (but in no case later than 24 hours after
receipt) advise Parent orally and in writing of the receipt of any
Company Takeover Proposal  



 

-31-  and of the price and other material terms and conditions of any such Company
Takeover Proposal (including the identity of the Person making such
Company Takeover Proposal) and of any changes or supplements thereto. The
Company (i) promptly (but in no case later than 24 hours thereafter) shall
advise Parent orally and in writing of the commencement of any discussions
with any third party or its representatives regarding a Company Takeover
Proposal by such third party and (ii) will keep Parent fully apprised on a
current basis of any material related developments, discussions, and
negotiations and shall provide to Parent promptly (but in no case later than
24 hours) after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of such Company
Takeover Proposal (including any amendments or supplements thereto) and all
such other information provided in writing to the Company by the party
making such Company Takeover Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.2_ or in _Section 6.6_
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from taking and disclosing to
its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure to the
Companys stockholders if, in the Company Boards determination in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law provided that the
Company and the Company Board may not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent the Company Recommendation, except to the extent expressly permitted
by the exceptions described in _Section 5.2(b)_.

company, or their respective Affiliates) in favor of the approval of
the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to (x) take, or cause to be

advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using reasonable best
efforts in (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and
notices required to be filed to consummate the Transactions, (ii) obtaining
(and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,
Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third party, including any
Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing all information
required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or filings with
any other Governmental Entity) required to be obtained or made by Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the Transactions and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement (it being understood that nothing in this
_Section 6.3_ shall require Parent to (A) consent to any action or omission
that would be inconsistent with _Section 5.1_ or  _Section 6.3(g)_ or (B)
agree to amend or waive any provision of this Agreement). Additionally, each
of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts not to take any
action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any Governmental Entity necessary to be obtained
prior to Closing.



 

-33- (b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information
with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties

Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the
other parties to this Agreement of any communication from any
Governmental Entity regarding any of the Transactions. If any party to this
Agreement or any Affiliate of such parties receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Transactions, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other
parties to this Agreement, an appropriate response in compliance with such
request. To the extent that transfers of any permits issued by any
Governmental Entity are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than fifteen Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR Act and
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly as practicable, to

resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, and any other United States federal or state or foreign or
supranational Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 6.3(d)_ shall
limit the right of any party hereto to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, so long as such party hereto has, up to the time of
termination, complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this _Section 6.3(d)_. Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the expiration of
the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with respect to
the Transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.

(e) The parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws so as to
enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date), including to avoid Parent or its Subsidiaries
from being disqualified or otherwise precluded from providing certain goods or
services to the United States Department of Defense as a result of an
Organizational Conflict of Interest issue. Those efforts shall include using
reasonable best efforts, subject to _Section 6.3(g)_, in (i) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of businesses,
product lines, assets or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
unless such sale, divestiture or disposition would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect,  



 

-34-  (ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing
Date would limit Parents or its Subsidiaries ability to retain one or more
of the businesses, product lines, assets or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, unless such action would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (iii) cooperating to satisfy Section
7.2(f), including agreeing to the divestiture or other transfer or
disposition of contracts listed on Section 6.3(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter (the " _Specified Contracts_ "), in each case in connection with using
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any preliminary or permanent injunction, in any Action under any Antitrust
Laws, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or to
avoid such disqualification or preclusion; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such action shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on or after March 1, 2008, the Company
determines in good faith that it is necessary or advisable to divest or
otherwise transfer or dispose of the Specified Contracts in order to satisfy
Section 7.2(f), then the Company shall be entitled to take all legally
permissible actions to divest or otherwise transfer or dispose of the
Specified Contracts to the extent such actions would not reasonably be
expected to result in an Organizational Conflict of Interest issue for, or
otherwise impose any material liability or obligation on, Parent or the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries.

(f) (i) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with respect to the prompt
preparation and submission of a joint filing and any requested supplemental
information (collectively, the " _Joint Filing_ ") to the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the United States (including any successor or replacement, "
_CFIUS_ ") under Exon-Florio with regard to the Transactions, (ii) Parent
shall take primary responsibility for preparation and submission of the Joint
Filing and (iii) the Company shall promptly provide to Parent all necessary
information and otherwise promptly assist Parent in order for Parent to
complete preparation and submission of the Joint Filing, to respond to any
inquiries from CFIUS or any other interested Governmental Entity and use
reasonable best efforts to secure the approval of CFIUS of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, neither this 
_Section 6.3_ nor any other provision in this Agreement shall require Parent
or any of its Affiliates to agree to any prohibition, limitation, restriction
or other requirement (i) on the businesses, product lines, assets
or operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or if such prohibition,
limitation, restriction or other requirement would reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, any portion of the businesses, product lines,
assets or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) that
requires Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate any
portion of the businesses, product lines, assets or operations of Parent or
any of its Affiliates, or if such prohibition, limitation, restriction or
other requirement would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect, any portion of the businesses, product lines, assets or operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) that otherwise restricts the
ability of Parent and its Affiliates to acquire, manage and hold, if such
prohibition, limitation, restriction or other requirement would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, any portion of the businesses,
product lines, assets or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and
in each case nothing in this Agreement shall authorize the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to (and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not) propose,
commit or agree to any of the foregoing.



 

-35- (h) The Company and the Company Board shall (i) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions or this Agreement and (ii) if
any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable
to the Transactions or this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure
that the Merger and the other Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger and the other
Transactions.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to the fullest extent
permitted under the DGCL, honor the Companys obligations existing as of the

individual who served at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_
") against all costs and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or

director or officer or is or was serving at the request of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission
occurring at or before the Effective Time (including the Transactions).

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, provide, for a period of not less than six years after the
Effective Time, the Companys current and former directors and officers (as
defined to mean those persons insured under such policy) with an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less
favorable than the existing policy or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300 percent of the aggregate annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance in 2007 through the date of
this Agreement on an annualized basis (the " _D andO Premium_"), but in such

_provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that at Parents option in lieu of the
foregoing insurance coverage, the Surviving Corporation may purchase "tail"
insurance coverage that provides coverage identical in all material respects
to the coverage described above and such purchases do not result in any gaps
or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time. The Company represents and warrants to Parent that the Companys 2007
annual premium was $465,000.

(c) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification set forth in the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated

employee or agent of the Company or is or previously was serving at the
request of the Company or its Subsidiaries as a director, trustee, officer,
member, manager, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint

Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws (or
other governing documents) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, under
the DGCL or any other applicable Laws or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Party with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party.

(e) In the event that the Parent or Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in

duplication of benefits).

(b) _Eligibility_. With respect to any Parent Plan in which any employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries first becomes eligible to participate
on or after the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) waive all pre-existing
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each such employee and his or her
eligible dependents under such Parent Plan, except to the extent such pre-
existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods applied immediately prior
thereto under the analogous Company Plan; (ii) provide such employee and his
or her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to becoming eligible to participate in such Parent Plan under the
analogous Company Plan (to the same extent that such credit was given under
such Company Plan) in satisfying any applicable deductible or annual or
lifetime maximum out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan; and (iii)
recognize all service of such employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries
and predecessors (including recognition of all prior service with any entity
(including any such Subsidiary prior to its becoming a Subsidiary of the
Company) that was recognized by the Company (or any such Subsidiary) prior to
the date hereof in the ordinary course of administering its (or
such Subsidiarys) employee benefits), for purposes of eligibility to
participate in and vesting in benefits (other than under any defined benefit
pension plan or as would result in any duplication of benefits) under such
Parent Plan, to the extent that such service was recognized for such purpose
under the analogous Company Plan.



 

-38- (c) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This _Section 6.9_ is not intended to
confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies
hereunder.

opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and its directors relating to any of the

delayed.

(b) by either Parent or the Company if:

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before April 30, 2008 (the "

_Section 7.2(e)_ or _Section 7.2(f)_ shall not have been fulfilled but all

Recommendation.

(e) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform or comply with any
of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this
Agreement, which breach or failure to perform or comply (i) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section
7.2(b)_ and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date ( _provided_ that Parent
is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, agreement or
covenant contained in this Agreement);

(f) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform or
comply with any of its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants
contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform or comply (i)

or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date ( _provided_
that the Company is not then in material breach of any representation,

shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party
(or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to the other party hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if such termination shall result from the (i) failure
of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations
of the other party to the extent required by this Agreement or (ii) failure of
either party to perform an agreement or covenant hereof, such party shall not
be relieved of any liability to the other party as a result of such failure
or breach; _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that the provisions of _Section
3.19_, _Section 6.6_, this _Section 8.2_,  _Article IX_ and _Article X_
hereof and the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive such
termination.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to the provisions
of _Section 8.1(d)_, (ii) by the Company pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 8.1(c)_ or (iii) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to the

have otherwise become publicly known and (B) at any time on or prior to the 12
month anniversary of such termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Takeover
Proposal or the transactions contemplated by any Company Takeover

8.2(b)(iii)(B), the term "Company Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
set forth in the definition of Company Takeover Proposal except that all
references to 20% shall be deemed references to 35%), the Company shall pay
Parent a fee equal to $12,850,000 by wire transfer (to an account designated
by Parent) in immediately available funds (x) in the case of clause (i),
within two business days after such termination, (y) in the case of clause
(ii), prior to or concurrently with such termination, and (z) in the case
of clause (iii), upon the earlier of entering into such definitive agreement
with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or consummation of the
transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover Proposal (unless the
transactions contemplated by such Takeover Proposal were consummated prior to
such termination, in which case, such fee shall be payable on the date of such
termination).

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 8.2(b)
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to
Section 8.2(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Merger Sub
commences a claim, action, suit or other proceeding that results in a judgment
against the Company, the Company shall pay to Parent interest on such amount
from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding
the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street

whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 9.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
