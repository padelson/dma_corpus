leased, subleased or otherwise occupied by the Company (the &#147;<U>Leased Real Property</U>&#148;). The Company does not own any real property. All of the leases or subleases of the Leased Real Property (the &#147;<U>Leases</U>&#148;) are valid,
binding and in full force and effect, except insofar as the enforceability thereof may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors&#146; right&#146;s generally, or by principles
governing the availability of equitable remedies. No Lease is subject to any mortgage, pledge, lien, encumbrance, sublease, assignment, license or other agreement granting to any third party any interest in such Lease or any right to the use or
occupancy of any Leased Real Property, other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Company, as lessee under each Lease, is now in possession of all of the applicable Leased Real Property. There is no pending or, to the Company&#146;s knowledge,
threatened proceeding that might interfere in any material respect with the quiet enjoyment of the lessee. To the Company&#146;s knowledge, the Company has performed all material obligations required to be performed by it to date under each Lease,
and no event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a material default on the part of the Company under any such Lease. The Company has exercised within the time prescribed in each Lease any
option provided therein to extend or renew the term thereof. As used herein, the term &#147;Lease&#148; shall also include subleases, the term &#147;lessor&#148; shall also include any sublessor, and the term &#147;lessee&#148; shall also include
any sublessee. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">4.19 <B><I>Not an Investment
