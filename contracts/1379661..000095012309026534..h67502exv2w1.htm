to mutually agree upon Final Net Working Capital, then Buyer and Sellers shall submit any disputed
items relating to such calculation to an independent accounting firm of recognized national
standing as may be mutually selected by Buyer and Sellers. The costs of such independent
accountant shall be borne 50% by Sellers and 50% by Buyer. Buyer shall pay to Sellers an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of the Final Net Working Capital minus the Estimated Net Working
Capital, or Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Estimated Net
Working Capital minus the Final Net Working Capital. Such true-up payments (the &#147;<B><I>Working Capital

(whether by mutual agreement or by decision of the independent accounting firm) with respect to the
