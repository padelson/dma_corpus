 (c) The title commitments delivered at Closing (the " _Title Commitments_ ") shall not indicate any defects in title other than Permitted Liens and defects that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to materially and adversely impact the ability of the Companies to conduct the Downstream Business.

The Disposition Payment shall be made within ten days following closing of any Disposition via wire transfer of immediately available funds by Buyer to an account designated (in writing) by Sellers. For purposes of determining the portion of the adjusted Purchase Price which shall be allocable to a Disposition, an allocation shall be based on the portion of the 2009 EBITDA attributable to the assets or business sold relative to the 2009 EBITDA for the Company Assets, collectively. Sellers acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.12 to the contrary, the approval of the Conflicts Committee shall be required for any such Disposition.

ARTICLE VII 
 TAX MATTERS 

    

 Section 7.1 _Tax Returns_. 

   

 (a) Through the Closing, Sellers shall cause each of the Companies to continue their current tax treatment as (a) partnerships or (b) entities that are disregarded as separate from their owner for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3(b)(1), and the operations of each of the Companies through the Effective Time shall be reflected on the federal income Tax Return of its owners. The income of the Companies will be apportioned to the period up to and including the Effective Time, and the 

   ##### 

  

    

period after the Effective Time by closing the books of the Companies as of
the Effective Time except as otherwise provided below in Section 7.1(c). 

   

 (b) With respect to any Tax Return of a Company covering a taxable period ending on or before the Effective Time that is required to be filed after the Effective Time, Sellers shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax items required to be included therein. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, Sellers shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Buyer together with a statement of the difference, if any, of the amount of Tax shown due on such Tax Return over the amount set up as a liability for such Tax (for the period through the Effective Time) in the Final Net Working Capital. Sellers shall make all reasonable changes to such Tax Return requested by Buyer not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. If the Tax shown on the Tax Return exceeds the amount set up as a liability for the Tax (for the period through the Effective Time) in the Final Net Working Capital, not later than the due date of such Tax Return, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount of such excess. If the amount set up as a liability for the Tax (for the period through the Effective Time) in the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Tax shown on the Tax Return, not later than the due date of such Tax Return, Buyer shall pay to Sellers the amount of such excess. Buyer shall cause the Company to file the Tax Return and timely pay the Taxes shown due on such Tax Return. 

   

 (c) With respect to any Tax Return of a Company covering a taxable period beginning on or before the Effective Time and ending after the Effective Time that is required to be filed after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause such Tax Return to be prepared and shall cause to be included in such Tax Return all Tax items required to be included therein. Buyer shall determine (by an interim closing of the books as of the Effective Time except for ad valorem Taxes and franchise taxes based solely on capital which shall be prorated on a daily basis) the Tax which would have been due with respect to the period covered by such Tax Return if such taxable period ended on the Effective Time (the " _Pre-Closing Tax_ "). For this purpose, any franchise Tax paid or payable with respect to a Company shall be allocated to the taxable period for which payment of the Tax provides the right to engage in business, regardless of the taxable period during which the income, operations, assets or capital comprising the base of such Tax is measured. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of each such Tax Return, Buyer shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return to Sellers for their review. Buyer shall make all reasonable changes to such Tax Return requested by Sellers not later than ten (10) days prior to the due date of such Tax Return. Not later than the due date of the Tax Return, either (i) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the excess, if any, of the Pre-Closing Tax over the amount set up as a liability for the Pre-Closing Tax in the Final Net Working Capital, or (ii) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the excess, if any, of the amount set up as a liability for the Pre-Closing Tax in the Final Net Working Capital over the Pre-Closing Tax. Buyer shall cause the Company to file the Tax Return and timely pay the Taxes shown due on such Tax Return. 

   

 (d) Any Tax Return prepared pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.1 shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns, except as otherwise required by Law or fact. Any dispute arising pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.1(b) or Section 7.1(c) shall be resolved pursuant to procedures comparable to the procedures applicable under Section 2.4(d). 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully, and Buyer shall cause each of the Companies to cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section 7.1 (and Section 7.6), requests for the provision of any information or documentation within the knowledge or possession of the other Party as reasonably necessary to facilitate compliance with financial reporting obligations arising under FASB Statement No. 109 (including without limitation, compliance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48), and any audit, litigation or other proceeding (each a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include access to, the retention and (upon the other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Sellers will, and Buyer will and will cause the Companies to, (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating to any taxable period beginning before the Effective Time until the later of six (6) years after the Effective Time or the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations of the respective taxable periods (including any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Tax Authority, and (ii) give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Sellers each agree, upon request, to use Reasonable Efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 7.2 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be responsible for and indemnify Sellers for the payment of all state and local transfer, sales, use, stamp, registration or other similar Taxes resulting from the transactions contemplated hereby.

The representations and warranties contained in Section 4.9 shall survive the Closing until six months after expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Buyer shall be solely liable for, shall pay and shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sellers from any and all Taxes, together with costs and expenses with respect thereto, which relate to or result from the income, business, property or operations of the Companies after the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) If any claim (an " _Indemnified Tax Claim_ ") is made by any Tax Authority that, if successful, would result in indemnification of any Party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") by another Party (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ ") under this Section 7.3, the Tax Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later than the earlier of (i) forty-five (45) days after receipt of notice from the Tax Authority of such claim or (ii) fifteen (15) days prior to the date required

in writing of such fact, including a description in reasonable detail of the
nature of the Indemnified Tax Claim, and a copy of all papers received with
respect to such claim (if any). 

   

 (c) The Tax Indemnifying Party shall control all decisions with respect to any Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim and the Tax Indemnified Party shall take such action (including settlement with respect to such Tax Proceeding or the prosecution of such Tax Proceeding to a determination in a court or other tribunal of initial or appellate jurisdiction) in connection with a Tax Proceeding involving an Indemnified Tax Claim as the Tax Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including the selection of counsel and experts and the execution of powers of attorney; _provided_ that (i) if within thirty (30) days after the notice required by Section 7.3(b) has been delivered (or such earlier date that any payment of Taxes with respect to such claim is due but in no event sooner than five days after the Tax Indemnifying Partys receipt of such notice), the Tax Indemnifying Party requests that such claim be contested, and (ii) if the Tax Indemnified Party is requested by the Tax Indemnifying Party to pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have advanced to the Tax Indemnified Party, on an interest-free basis, the amount of such claim. The Tax Indemnified Party shall not make any payment of an Indemnified Tax Claim for at least thirty (30) days (or such shorter period as may be required by applicable law) after the giving of the notice required by Section 7.3(b) with respect to such claim, shall give to the Tax Indemnifying Party any information requested related to such claim, and otherwise shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnifying Party in order to contest effectively any such claim. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.3 to the contrary, (i) the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not, without the written consent of the Tax Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), enter into any compromise or settlement regarding an Indemnified Tax Claim that will effect taxable periods ending after the Effective Time or that involves issues that recur for taxable periods ending after the Effective Time, (ii) the Tax Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control (subject to clause "(iii)" below), any defense or settlement of any Indemnified Tax Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 7.3, and the Tax Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation, and (iii) if the Tax Indemnifying Party fails to take action to timely defend an Indemnified Tax Claim, then the Tax Indemnified Party shall have the exclusive right to defend, and be reimbursed by the Tax Indemnifying Party for its reasonable cost and expense, in regard to the Indemnified Tax Claim with counsel selected by the Tax Indemnified Party, in which case the Tax Indemnified Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Tax Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Indemnified Tax Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Tax Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

 Section 7.4 _Scope_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Article VII shall be the exclusive remedy for any claims relating to Taxes (including any claims relating to representations respecting Tax matters including Section 4.9). The rights under this Article VII shall survive the Closing until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions) applicable to such Tax matter. No claim may be made or brought by any Party hereto after the expiration of the applicable survival period unless such claim has been

asserted by written notice specifying the details supporting the claim on or
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period.

 Section 9.1 _Survival_. 

   

 (a) The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement and all covenants contained in this Agreement that are to be performed prior to the Closing will survive the closing for 12 months following the Closing; _provided, however_ , that (i) the Fundamental Representations and Warranties shall survive for the applicable statute of

limitations, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.9
(Taxes) shall survive as set forth in Article VII and (iii) the
representation and warranty in Section 4.10 (Environmental Matters) shall not
survive the Closing. Except as expressly set forth in Section 9.1(b) below,
no Party shall have any liability for indemnification claims made under
this Article IX with respect to any such representation, warranty or pre-
closing covenant unless a Claim Notice is provided by the non-breaching Party

for such representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant. If a Claim Notice
has been timely given in accordance with this Agreement prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period for such representation,
warranty or pre-closing covenant or claim, then the applicable
representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant shall survive as to such
claim, until such claim has been finally resolved. 

   

 (b) Sellers shall have no liability for indemnification claims under Section 9.2(a)(ii) unless the appropriate written notice as referenced in the definition of "Pre-Closing Environmental Matter" is provided by Buyer to Sellers on or prior to the second anniversary of Closing. If such notice has been given in accordance with this Agreement prior to the second anniversary of the Closing, then Sellers will have an indemnification obligation with respect to the Pre-Closing Environmental Matters specifically described in such notice and such indemnification obligation shall survive and continue after the second anniversary of the Closing. 

   

 (c) All covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement to be performed after the Closing, will survive the Closing in accordance with their terms. 

   

 (d) The representations and warranties of Sellers will not be affected or reduced as a result of any investigation or Knowledge of Buyer. 

   

 (e) For purposes of clarity, the limitations set forth in Section 9.4(a),(b) and (c) do not apply to indemnification claims for Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities made under Section 9.2(a)(ii) or for the Defense Actions made under Section 9.2(a)(iii). 

   

 Section 9.2 _Indemnification_. 

   

 (a) Subject to Article VII relating to Taxes and the provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, Sellers shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, Buyers Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against (i) all Losses that Buyer Indemnified Parties incur arising from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers in this Agreement; (ii) Pre-Closing Environmental Liabilities; and (iii) any of the Defense Actions. 

   

 (b) Subject to Article VII relating to Taxes and the provisions of this Article IX, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates and their respective Representatives (the " _Sellers Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses that Sellers Indemnified Parties incur arising from or out of (i) the business and operations of the Companies (whether relating to periods prior to or after the Effective Time) to the extent such Losses are not matters for which Sellers have an indemnification obligation 

   ##### 

  

    

under the provisions of Section 9.2(a) or (ii) any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Buyer in this Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a duty to use Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, all Losses relating to Taxes which are the subject of Article VII shall only be subject to indemnification under Section 7.3. 

   

 Section 9.3 _Indemnification Procedures_. Claims for indemnification under this Agreement (other than claims involving a Tax Proceeding or a breach of Section 4.9, the procedures for which are set forth in Article VII) shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

   

 (a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Sellers Indemnified Party claiming indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to indemnification under Section 9.2 shall promptly (i) notify the other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to the Indemnifying Party a written notice (" _Claim Notice_ ") describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to such claim (if any), the Indemnified Partys best estimate of the amount of Losses attributable to the Third-Party Claim and the basis of the Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or omission. 

   

 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), by all appropriate proceedings, to a final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Section 9.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof; _provided, however,_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement agreement without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided further, however_ , that such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates. If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including the making of any related counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim 

   ##### 

  

    

controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), and the
Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. 

   

 (c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if the Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in regard to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party (who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party), by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified Party shall defend any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided, however_ , that the Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. 

   

 (d) Subject to the other provisions of this Article IX, a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought. 

   

 (e) In the event an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a claim of indemnification under this Article IX, no other Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification. 

   

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.3, the indemnification procedures set forth in Article VII shall control any indemnities relating to Taxes. 

   

 Section 9.4 _Additional Agreements Regarding Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (and excluding matters covered by Article VII): 

   

 (a) a breach of any representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) of Sellers in this Agreement in connection with any single item or group of related items that results in Losses of less than $250,000 shall be deemed, for all purposes of this Article IX not to be a breach of such representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant; 

   

 (b) Sellers shall have no liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations or warranties (other than with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties) except if the aggregate Losses actually incurred by Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder exceed $7,950,000 (and then, subject to Section 9.4(c), only to the extent such aggregate Losses exceed such amount); 

   

 (c) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating to Section 9.2(a)(i) for breaches of representations, warranties or pre-closing covenants (other than 

   ##### 

  

    

with respect to a breach of the Fundamental Representations and Warranties)
exceed $58,300,000; 

   

 (d) The amount of any Loss for which a Buyer Indemnified Party claims indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by: (i) any insurance proceeds actually recovered with respect to such Loss; (ii) any Tax Benefits with respect to such Loss and (iii) indemnification or reimbursement payments actually recovered from third parties with respect to such Loss; 

   

 (e) For purposes of determining whether there has been a breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty by a party in connection with the assertion of a claim for indemnification under Article IX, or determining the amount of a Loss, with respect to any asserted breach or inaccuracy, such determination shall be made without regard to any qualifier as to "material," "materiality" or Material Adverse Effect expressly contained in Article III or IV. 

   

 Section 9.5 _Waiver of Other Representations_. 

   

 (a) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, IT IS THE EXPLICIT INTENT OF EACH PARTY HERETO, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE, THAT NONE OF SELLERS OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR REPRESENTATIVES HAS MADE OR IS MAKING ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO THE CONDITION, MERCHANTABILITY, USAGE, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASED INTERESTS, THE COMPANIES, THEIR ASSETS, OR ANY PART THEREOF, EXCEPT THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING THE FOREGOING, SELLERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO BUYER WITH RESPECT TO ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR FORECASTS RELATING TO THE COMPANIES. 

   

 (b) The representations and warranties contained in Section 4.10 shall be the exclusive representations and warranties with regard to Environmental Laws and related matters. 

   

 Section 9.6 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Parties agree to treat all payments made pursuant to this Article IX as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

   

 Section 9.7 _Exclusive Remedy._  

   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein (i) except as provided in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 (as to all of which Buyer shall be entitled to specific performance and Sellers shall be entitled to damages without regard to the limitations provided in Section 9.7(b) below), (ii) except as provided in Sections 6.5, 7.2, 7.3, 9.2 or 10.2, and (iii) other than with respect to any claim for fraud, no Party shall have any liability, and no Party shall make any claim, for any Loss or other matter (and Buyer and Sellers hereby waive any right of contribution against the other and their respective Affiliates), under, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any other document, agreement, certificate or other matter delivered pursuant hereto 

   ##### 

  

    

or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether based on contract, tort,
strict liability, other Laws or otherwise. 

   

 (b) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT; _PROVIDED, HOWEVER_ , THAT THIS SECTION 9.7(b) SHALL NOT LIMIT A PARTYS RIGHT TO RECOVERY UNDER ARTICLE VII OR ARTICLE IX FOR ANY SUCH DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT SUCH PARTY IS REQUIRED TO PAY SUCH DAMAGES TO A THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A MATTER FOR WHICH SUCH PARTY IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER ARTICLE IX.

 (d) THE PARTIES HERETO AGREE THAT THEY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION TO ENFORCE OR INTERPRET THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 Reimbursement Obligations

 (a) Targa hereby agrees to continue to provide the Partnership Group with certain general and administrative services, such as legal, accounting, treasury, insurance, risk management, health, safety and environmental, information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, internal audit, taxes, engineering and marketing. These general and administrative services shall be substantially identical in nature and quality to the services of such type previously provided by Targa in connection with their management and operation of the North Texas Assets prior to their acquisition by the Partnership. In the event that the Partnership Group makes any acquisitions of assets or businesses from Targa or its Affiliates during the first three years following the Closing Date, Targa will similarly provide general and administrative services that are substantially identical in nature and quality to the services of such type previously provided by Targa in connection with their management and operation of such assets or businesses prior to their acquisition by the Partnership. 

   

 (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.1(c) and 2.1(d) below, the Partnership Group hereby agrees to reimburse Targa for all expenses and expenditures Targa or its Affiliates incur or payments they make on behalf of the Partnership Group for these general and administrative services. 

   

 (c) The amount for which Targa shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Partnership Group pursuant to Section 2.1(b) for general and administrative expenses shall not exceed $5.0 million annually for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date (the " _G andA Expenses Limit_"). Following the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the GandA Expenses Limit shall be increased annually over the next two years by the percentage increase in the _Consumer Price Index  All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average, Not Seasonally Adjusted _(the _"CPI Index"_ ) for the applicable year. In making such adjustment, the GandA Expenses Limit shall be increased on the first anniversary of the Closing Date by the CPI Index for the prior year period based on the most recent information available from the U.S. Department of Labor and similarly increased on the second anniversary of the Closing Date by the CPI Index for the prior year period. In the event that the Partnership Group makes any acquisitions of assets or businesses or the business of the Partnership Group otherwise expands during the first three 

   ##### 

  

 

years following the Closing Date, then the GandA Expenses Limit shall be
appropriately increased in order to account for adjustments in the nature and
extent of the general and administrative services by Targa to the Partnership
Group, with any such increase in the GandA Expenses Limit subject to the
approval of the Conflicts Committee. From and after October 24, 2007, the
GandA Expenses Limit is increased by the actual amount of general and
administrative expenses allocated by Targa for the services provided to the
SAOU/LOU Business, according to the allocation methodology utilized by Targa.
From and after the date hereof, the GandA Expenses Limit is increased by the
actual amount of general and administrative expenses allocated by Targa for
the services provided to the Downstream Business, according to the allocation
methodology utilized by Targa. After the third anniversary of the Closing
Date, the GandA Expenses Limit will no longer apply and the General Partner
will determine the amount of general and administrative expenses that will
be properly allocated to the Partnership in accordance with the terms of the
Partnership Agreement. The GandA Expenses Limit shall not apply to
reimbursement for direct expenses of the Partnership as provided in Section
2.2. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding the obligations of the Partnership Group set forth in Sections 2.1(b) and 2.1(c) above and subject to Section 4.1(c), for any fiscal quarter during the Term of Support for which the Partnerships Distribution Coverage for such quarter is less than the Minimum Coverage Threshold (before giving effect to any reduction in the reimbursement of general and administrative expenses contemplated in this clause (d) for such quarter), the general and administrative expenses for such quarter relating to the matters for which Targa would otherwise be entitled to reimbursement will be reduced by the amount (the " _Support Amount_ ") required for the Partnership to meet the Minimum Coverage Threshold for such quarter; _provided, however_ , that in no event will the Support Amount exceed $8 million for any quarter. During the Term of Support, the Distribution Coverage for each applicable quarter is to be calculated assuming that Total Distributions for such quarter equal an amount in cash sufficient to pay all equity holders including incentive distributions for the period for which distributions are declared a distribution of $0.5175 per unit. The Support Amount (i) is to be calculated by the Partnership in conjunction with closing the financial statements for the applicable quarter; (ii) will be accrued for the applicable quarter and reflected in distributable cash flow for such quarter; and (iii) will be settled by the Partnership in conjunction with the next regularly scheduled monthly payment (the " _Subsequent Payment_ ") for allocated expenses to be settled by the Partnership pursuant to this Agreement (the amount of the Subsequent Payment before giving effect to any Support Amount is the " _Subsequent Payment Amount"_ ). The Subsequent Payment will be settled as follows: (i) if the Support Amount is less than the Subsequent Payment Amount, then the Partnership will pay to Targa the Excess Amount; (ii) if the Support Amount is greater than the Subsequent Payment Amount, then Targa will pay to the Partnership the Excess Amount; and (iii) if the Support Amount is equal to the Subsequent Payment Amount, then no payment will be made by either the Partnership or Targa. 

   

 2.2 _Reimbursement for Direct Expenses._  

  

 (a) The Partnership Group hereby agrees to reimburse Targa and its Affiliates for all direct expenses and expenditures they incur or payments they make on behalf of the Partnership Group, including, but not limited to, (i) salaries of operational personnel performing services on the Partnership Groups behalf, the cost of employee benefits for such personnel and general and administrative expense associated with such personnel, (ii) capital expenditures, (iii)
