firms to select such firm) within 2 days of the end of such 10 business day
period. The Seller and the Buyer shall provide to the Independent Accountants
full cooperation. The Independent Accountants shall be instructed to reach

objections raised to the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be
divided equally between the Buyer and the Seller.   (b) If the amount of

the amount of such excess. Any adjustments in the Purchase Price pursuant
to this Section 2.6(c) shall be paid by the Buyer by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the Seller. Any payments required pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) shall be
made within 2 business days after the Closing Date Balance Sheet becomes

to use, or the validity or enforceability or effectiveness of any license

Intellectual Property is being infringed or violated or otherwise used or
available for use by any other Person (except pursuant to Nonwovens
Intellectual Property Licenses), and (iv) the consummation of this Agreement

Date, it will not disclose, give, sell, use or otherwise divulge any
confidential information relating to the Nonwovens Business.   (c) Other
than pursuant to a general advertisement not targeted or directed at
employees hired by the Buyer or its affiliates pursuant to this Agreement,
neither Seller nor any of its affiliates shall for a period of two (2) years
from the Closing Date solicit the employment of, or induce any person to
engage in such solicitation, of any employees hired by the Buyer or its
affiliates pursuant to this Agreement.   (d) It is the desire and intent of
the parties to this Agreement that the provisions of this Section 5.10 shall
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public
policies applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought. If
any particular provisions or portion of this Section 5.10 shall be
adjudicated to be invalid or unenforceable, this Section shall be deemed
amended to delete therefrom such provision or portion adjudicated to be
invalid or unenforceable, such amendment to apply only with respect to the
operation of such Section in the particular jurisdiction in which such
adjudication is made.   (e) The Seller recognizes and acknowledges that
the performance of the obligations under this Section 5.10 are special,
unique and extraordinary in character, and that in the event of a breach by
the Seller or its affiliates or their respective employees, officers,
directors or advisors of the terms and conditions of this Section 5.10, the
Buyer shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance thereof by the
Seller or its affiliates or to enjoin the Seller or its affiliates or
their respective employees, officers, directors or advisors from violating
the provisions of this Section 5.10.   5.11 No Solicitation.   (a) The
Seller shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries and the officers,
directors, agents and advisors of the Seller and its subsidiaries not to,
initiate, solicit or encourage inquiries or proposals with respect to, or
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential
information to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to, any
Nonwovens Acquisition Proposal. The Seller shall notify the Buyer promptly,
but in any event within 24 hours, of any such inquiries, proposals, or offers
received by, any such information requested from, or any such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its
representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the name of such
Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers. The
Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this Agreement
with any parties other than the Buyer with respect to any Nonwovens
Acquisition Proposal.   (b) Neither the Seller\'s Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Nonwovens Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement as
the same may be amended from time to time), (ii) cause the Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other similar agreement
with respect to any Nonwovens Acquisition Proposal (other than this Agreement
as the same may be amended from time to time), or withdraw or modify, in
a manner adverse to the Buyer, or fail to make, the recommendation
to Seller\'s shareholders that they vote in favor of Shareholder
Approval.   5.12 Shareholder Approval. Specifically at the request of the
Buyer and for the avoidance of doubt and uncertainty on the Buyer\'s part
concerning threatened claims against the Seller and its Board of Directors
arising out of a transaction such as that contemplated by this Agreement,
Seller shall take all action necessary or appropriate to duly convene a
meeting of Seller\'s shareholders (or to amend the agenda for Seller\'s
previous noticed Annual Meeting of Shareholders) in order to seek and to
obtain the Shareholder Approval as promptly as practicable. The Board of
Directors shall at all times recommend such approval and shall take all
reasonable action necessary or appropriate to solicit such approval.   5.13
Proxy Statement.   (a) The Seller shall promptly prepare and file with the
SEC in preliminary form the proxy information and other proxy solicitation
materials of the Seller (the "Proxy Materials") in connection with the
solicitation of proxies necessary to obtain the Shareholder Approval. The
Seller will endeavor to promptly respond to any comments of the SEC staff and
to file, and mail to shareholders, the Proxy Materials as soon as reasonably
practicable after all such comments are resolved. The Buyer shall cooperate
with the Seller in the preparation of the Proxy Materials. Prior to filing
the preliminary Proxy Materials, any response to the SEC staff comments, the
final Proxy Materials, and any amendment or supplement, the Seller shall give
the Buyer reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed filing.   (b)
The Seller represents, warrants and agrees that the Proxy Statement, as it
may be amended or supplemented, will not, at the date of mailing to
shareholders of the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement, and at
the time of the Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. If, at
any time prior to the Shareholder Meeting, the Seller becomes aware of any
information that would cause any of the statements in the Proxy Statement to
be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit any
material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not false
and misleading, it shall promptly so inform the Buyer and take the necessary
steps to amend or supplement the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by or on behalf of the Buyer expressly for inclusion in
the Proxy Statement. The Seller represents, warrants and agrees that the
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations thereunder.  
(c) The Buyer represents, warrants and agrees that none of the information
supplied by it or on its behalf expressly for inclusion in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement or any
amendment or supplement, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. If the Buyer shall become aware, prior to the Shareholder
Meeting, that any information so furnished by it would cause any of the
statements with respect to Buyer in the Proxy Statement to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make such statements not false or misleading, it
will promptly so advise the Seller.   Article VI   SELLER EMPLOYEES  
6.1 Employment.   (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, each employee of
the Seller employed in the Nonwovens Business immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Nonwovens Employees") shall cease to be an employee of
the Seller and the Buyer shall offer or cause to be offered employment, on an
at-will basis, to all Nonwovens Employees. Effective as of the Effective Time
and until December 31, 2001 and subject to Section 6.2(b), the Buyer shall
cause the Nonwovens Employees, as a group, who accept and commence employment
with the Buyer or a subsidiary of the Buyer as of the Effective Time (the
"Transferred Employees") to be provided with employee benefit arrangements
that shall, in the aggregate, be no less favorable than as provided by the
Seller to such Transferred Employees, as a group, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, provided that Buyer shall in no event be required to continue
or offer benefits comparable to Seller\'s post-retirement welfare benefits
referred to in Section 6.2(b).   (b) The Buyer shall cause the Transferred
Employees to be given full credit for all service with the Seller or any
subsidiary of the Seller prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual) under any
employee benefit plans or arrangements of the Buyer or any subsidiary of the
Buyer in which such Transferred Employees participate from and after
the Effective Time, to the same extent such service was recognized by
the Seller or any subsidiary of the Seller under a corresponding Plan of
Seller immediately prior to the Effective Time. Neither the Buyer nor
any subsidiary of the Buyer shall require any Transferred Employee to undergo
a physical examination or provide other proof of insurability as a
condition to initial eligibility to participate in the medical and life
insurance plans of Buyer, in connection with the transfer of employment. The
Buyer shall, or shall cause a subsidiary of the Buyer to, (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable
to Transferred Employees under the medical and life insurance plans in
which such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time
in connection with the transfer of employment to Buyer, other than
limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to
such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time
under any welfare plan of the Seller or any subsidiary of the Seller in
which Transferred Employees participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and (ii) provide each Transferred Employee with credit for any co-
payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying
any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the year in
which the Effective Time occurs under any welfare plans in which such
employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, as if
those deductibles or co-payments had been paid under the welfare plans in
which such employees are eligible to participate after the Effective
Time.   (c) Subject to Section 6.2, the Seller shall remain responsible
for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer against, any and all
claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses and other liabilities (other than
those constituting Nonwovens Liabilities) relating to or arising out of any
of its employee benefit plans, programs, agreements or arrangements or
obligations thereunder accrued and related to circumstances existing prior to
the Effective Time. Subject to Section 6.2, Buyer shall be responsible for,
and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller against, any and all claims,
losses, damages, costs and expenses and other liabilities relating to or
arising out of any of the Buyer\'s employee benefit arrangements or
obligations thereunder accrued after the Effective Time.   6.2 Assumption
of Plans.   (a) Effective as of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
establish or designate a defined contribution plan and trust intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code (the
"Buyer Savings Plan"). As soon as practicable following the receipt by Seller
of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service
(the "IRS") regarding the qualified status of the Buyer Savings Plan and
the receipt by Buyer of a favorable determination letter from the IRS
regarding the qualified status of the ESPRIT Plan, the Seller shall direct
the trustee of the ESPRIT Plan to transfer, to the trustee of the Buyer
Savings Plan, as of the Effective Time, in a lump sum, the cash value of
the account balances under the ESPRIT Plan in respect of Transferred
Employees. Upon such transfer, the Buyer Savings Plan shall assume liability
to pay benefits in the amounts so transferred, as such amounts may be
increased or decreased thereafter, in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of the Buyer Savings Plan. Prior to the date of the transfer of
the cash value of account balances as contemplated by this Section 6.2(a),
the Seller shall contribute to the trustee of the ESPRIT Plan an amount equal
to 10% of the aggregate Compensation (as defined in the ESPRIT Plan and
prorated for such portion of the ESPRIT Plan year preceding the Effective
Time) of each Transferred Employee who is a participant in the ESPRIT Plan as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Pending such transfer,
the Transferred Employees shall have all of the same rights, features
and options with respect to their account balances in the ESPRIT Plan as
active employees under such plan(s) except for the right to
additional contributions. The parties shall cooperate in the filing of the
documents required by the transfer of assets and liabilities described
herein. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no such
transfer shall take place until the 31st day following the filing of all
required Forms 5310-A in connection therewith. Subject to confirmation that
this form is required to be filed.   (b) The Seller shall retain and be
responsible for, and the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer
against, any and all claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses with respect
to post-retirement welfare benefits to which any Transferred Employee or any
former employee of the Nonwovens Business is currently entitled or may become
entitled after the Effective Time under the Seller\'s post-retirement welfare
benefit program. The Buyer shall provide such information as the Seller or
its designee may reasonably request, from time to time, in connection with
the administration of the Seller\'s post-retirement welfare benefit
program.   (c) The Buyer shall assume all liabilities and obligations of
the Seller with respect to the Nonwovens Employees arising under (i) the
Dexter Corporation Special Severance Plan (as such plan has been modified by
employee communications described in Schedule 6.2(c)(i)), except for the
liabilities arising under Sections 2(e) and 2(f) of such plan, (ii) the pay-
to-stay arrangements described in Schedule 6.2(c)(ii) and (iii) the severance
agreements (described in Schedule 6.2(c)(iii)) to provide continuation of
"Employee Benefits" that are welfare benefits as described in Section
4(a)(ii) of the severance agreements.   (d) The Seller shall be fully
responsible for any benefits in the nature of severance pay due to any
Nonwovens Employee who does not accept an offer of employment described in
section 6.1(a) hereof. The severance benefits provided by the Buyer to any
Transferred Employee whose employment with the Buyer is involuntarily
terminated (other than for cause) by the Buyer or a Buyer subsidiary within
twelve months following the Effective Time shall not be less favorable than
the severance benefits that a Nonwovens Employee would have been entitled to
had his or her employment been terminated by the Seller or a Nonwovens
Subsidiary (as the case may be) immediately prior to the Effective Time. The
preceding sentence shall not apply to any Nonwovens Employee who immediately
prior to the Effective Time, is (i) a party to a severance agreement
described in Section 6.2(c) or (ii) a participant in the Dexter Corporation
Special Severance Plan.   (e) To the extent that any obligations might
arise under the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act ("WARN"), 29
U.S.C. Section 2101 et seq., or under any similar provision of any federal,
state, regional, foreign, or local law, rule, or regulation (hereinafter
referred to collectively as "WARN Obligations") as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Seller shall be responsible
for any WARN Obligations arising as a result of any employment losses
occurring prior to the Effective Time, and the Buyer shall be responsible for
any WARN Obligations arising as a result of any employment losses
occurring after the Effective Time.   Article VII   CLOSING

TAX MATTERS   8.1 Tax Matters.   (a) The Buyer shall timely prepare and
file (or cause such preparation and filing) with the appropriate authorities
all income Tax returns, reports and forms (other than any Consolidated
Income Tax Returns) for the Nonwovens Subject Subsidiaries that are required
to be filed after the date of the Effective Time ("Buyer Returns"), and will
pay (or cause to be paid) all income Taxes due with respect to such
Buyer Returns. The Buyer shall make available to the Seller any Buyer Returns
and related workpapers with respect to any taxable period that ends on
or before, or includes, the date of the Effective Time for Seller\'s review
and comment at least twenty (20) business days prior to the respective
due dates of such Buyer Returns. Such Buyer Returns shall be subject
to Seller\'s approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
before the applicable Buyer Return is filed with the appropriate authority.
The Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause such preparation and
filing) with the appropriate authorities (i) all Consolidated Income Tax
Returns of the Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Nonwovens
Business and the Nonwovens Assets, and (ii) all other income Tax returns,
reports and forms for the Nonwovens Subsidiaries other than the Nonwovens
Subject Subsidiaries and (iii) all other income Tax returns, reports and
forms with respect to the Nonwovens Business and the Nonwovens Assets that
are required to be filed on or before the date of the Effective Time, and
will pay (or cause to be paid) all income Taxes due with respect to
such returns, reports and forms.   (b) The Buyer shall timely prepare and
file (or cause such preparation and filing) with the appropriate authorities
all non-income Tax returns, reports and forms that are required to be
filed after the date of the Effective Time (subject to any applicable
extensions) with respect to the Nonwovens Business and the Nonwovens Assets
when such returns, reports and forms are due and will pay (or cause to be
paid) all non-income Taxes due with respect to such returns, reports and
forms.   (c) The Seller and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in
preparing and filing all Tax returns, reports and forms required to be filed
with respect to Taxes levied or imposed upon, or in connection with, the
Nonwovens Business or the Nonwovens Assets, and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect thereto, including by maintaining and making available to
each other all records (other than the Nonwovens Books and Records, which
shall be governed by Section 8.1(d) hereof) reasonably necessary in
connection therewith. The Buyer shall prepare (or cause such preparation)
within 90 days of the Effective Time, usual and customary Nonwovens Subject
Subsidiaries\' consolidated and controlled foreign corporation Tax return
reporting packages with respect to the taxable period beginning January 1,
2000 and ending as of the Effective Time.   (d) For a period of six years
after the Closing Date, the Seller and its representatives shall have
reasonable access to the Nonwovens Books and Records transferred to the Buyer
hereunder (including, without limitation, the right to make extracts thereof)
to the extent that the Nonwovens Books and Records relate to Taxes and to
the extent that such access may reasonably be required by the Seller
in connection with matters relating to or affected by the operation of
the Nonwovens Business and the Nonwovens Assets prior to the Closing Date.
Such access shall be afforded by the Buyer upon receipt of reasonable
advance notice and during normal business hours. The Seller shall be
solely responsible for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by it pursuant to this Section 8.1(d). If the Buyer shall desire to
dispose of any of such books and records prior to the expiration of such six-
year period, the Buyer shall, prior to such disposition, give the Seller
a reasonable opportunity, at the Seller\'s expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as the Seller may select. In addition to
the foregoing, the parties agree to cooperate with each other with respect
to the defense of any claims or litigation relating to Taxes pertaining to
the Nonwovens Business and the Nonwovens Assets, provided that the
party requesting such cooperation shall reimburse the other party for the
other party\'s reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of furnishing
such cooperation.   (e) Not later than 15 days prior to the
Effective Time, the Buyer shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and submit
to the Seller for the Seller\'s review and approval, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, a draft allocation of the Purchase Price and
the Nonwovens Liabilities among the Nonwovens Assets, including the
capital stock of the Nonwovens Subsidiaries, to be purchased hereunder,
which allocation shall be reflected in Schedule 8.1(e) (the "Draft
Allocation"). The Draft Allocation shall be revised and finalized by the
parties in conjunction with the post-closing adjustment pursuant to Section
2.6 (the "Final Allocation"). The Draft Allocation and the Final Allocation
shall be made in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and applicable
Treasury regulations as well as under any analogous provisions of foreign
Law. Each of the Seller and the Buyer shall (i) be bound by the Final
Allocation for purposes of determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file, and
cause its affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax returns on a basis
consistent with the Final Allocation and (iii) take no position, and cause
its affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with the Final Allocation on
any applicable Tax return, in any proceeding before any taxing authority
or otherwise. In the event that the Final Allocation is disputed by any
taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly
notify the other party hereto concerning resolution of the dispute.   (f)
The Buyer shall not (i) make an election to treat any of the Nonwovens
Subject Subsidiaries as a disregarded entity (or as a partnership) for
federal, state or local income Tax purposes for any period in which the
Seller wholly owns, directly or indirectly, the Nonwovens Subsidiaries, (ii)
make any dividend or other distributions to shareholders from any of the
Nonwovens Subsidiaries at any time on or after the Effective Time until
January 1, 2001, or (iii) make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code
and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the
acquisition of any of the Nonwovens Subject Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the Seller.   (g) The Seller and the Buyer agree that the
Buyer has purchased substantially all the property used in the Nonwovens
Business in the United States, and in connection therewith, the Buyer shall
employ individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were employed in
such trade or business by the Seller. Accordingly, pursuant to Rev. Proc.
96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399, the Buyer shall furnish a United States Internal
Revenue Service Form W-2 to each employee employed by the Buyer who had
been employed by the Seller, disclosing all wages and other compensation
paid for such calendar year, and taxes withheld therefrom, and the Seller
shall be relieved of the responsibility to do so.   8.2 Indemnity for
Taxes.   (a) The Seller hereby agrees to indemnify the Buyer and the
Nonwovens Business against and hold them harmless, on an after-Tax basis,
from all liability for (i) income Taxes levied or imposed upon, or in
connection with, the Nonwovens Assets or the Nonwovens Business with respect
to any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Effective
Time, (ii) income Taxes levied or imposed upon, or in connection with, any
business of the Seller other than the Nonwovens Business, and (iii) income
Taxes incurred as a result of any other transaction undertaken by the Seller,
including without limitation the liquidation and dissolution of the Seller;
provided, however, that the Seller shall not indemnify the Buyer for any such
Taxes included in the Nonwovens Liabilities and taken into account in
preparing the Closing Date Balance Sheet.   (b) (i) The Seller agrees to
indemnify the Buyer and the Nonwovens Business against and hold them
harmless, on an after-Tax basis, from all income Taxes, expenses or other
losses arising out of the failure of the Seller to perform any of the
agreements it is required to perform under Section 8.1 and (ii) the Buyer
agrees to indemnify the Seller and hold it harmless, on an after-Tax basis,
from all Taxes, expenses or other losses arising out of the failure by the
Buyer to perform any of the agreements it is required to perform under
Section 8.1.   (c) The Buyer and the Seller agree to treat any payment
under this Section 8.2 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   (d) The
respective indemnification obligations of the Seller and the Buyer pursuant
to this Section 8.2 shall terminate ninety (90) days following the expiration
of the period of limitations applicable to the related Tax.   (e) A party
seeking indemnification provided for under this Section 8.2 (a "Tax
Indemnified Party") in respect of Taxes, arising out of or involving a claim
or demand made by any persons, firm, governmental authority or corporation
against such party (a "Tax Third Party Claim") must notify the party from
whom such indemnification is sought (the "Tax Indemnifying Party") in writing
of the Tax Third Party Claim as promptly as possible but in no event later
than 30 days after receipt by the Tax Indemnified Party of written notice of
the Tax Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the Tax Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced
as a result of such failure (except that the Tax Indemnifying Party shall not
be liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the
Tax Indemnified Party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the
Tax Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Tax Indemnifying Party, as
promptly as possible but in no event later than 30 days after the Tax
Indemnified Party\'s receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Tax Indemnified Party, relating to
the Tax Third Party Claim.   If a Tax Third Party Claim is made against the
Tax Indemnified Party, the Tax Indemnifying Party will be entitled
to participate in the defense thereof and to assume the defense thereof
with counsel or other tax advisors selected by the Tax Indemnifying Party
and satisfactory to the Tax Indemnified Party provided, however, that the
Tax Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any
such contest unless the Tax Indemnifying Party at its option has either
provided bond or other security for its obligations under this Section
8.2 satisfactory to the Tax Indemnified Party or paid the Tax Third
Party Claim. If the Tax Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Tax Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Tax Indemnified Party
for legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Tax Indemnified
Party in connection with the defense thereof. If the Tax Indemnifying
Party assumes such defense, the Tax Indemnified Party shall have the right
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel or other
tax advisors at its own expense separate from the counsel or other tax
advisors employed by the Tax Indemnifying Party. The Tax Indemnifying Party
shall be liable for all reasonable fees and expenses of counsel or other
tax advisors employed by the Tax Indemnified Party for any period subsequent
to the date the Tax Indemnified Party notifies the Tax Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Section 8.2(e) and during which the Tax Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense thereof. Whether or not the Tax
Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Tax Third Party Claim,
all of the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall include the provision to the
Tax Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to such Tax Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the Tax Indemnifying
Party shall have assumed the defense of a Tax Third Party Claim, the
Tax Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, such Tax Third Party Claim without the
Tax Indemnifying Party\'s prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.   (f) Without the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if a Material
Adverse Effect on the liability for Taxes of the Buyer with respect to or

any Governmental Entity) except (i) as may be required by Law; and (ii) as is
permitted by this Agreement;   (c) neither party hereto shall have any
liability or further obligation to the other party to this Agreement pursuant

termination of this Agreement other than pursuant to Section 9.1(d) and upon
request by the Buyer, the Seller shall promptly reimburse the Buyer for its

Transaction as a result of which shareholders of the Seller would be entitled
to receive (in the case of a definitive agreement), or receive, aggregate
average consideration with a fair market value per share exceeding $45

or similar transactions and taking into account any extraordinary dividends
or amounts paid in issuer tender offers or other extraordinary amounts

Agreement, dated March 16, 2000 between the Buyer and the Seller, embodies
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. There are no restrictions,

reason any term or provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, all other valid terms and provisions hereof shall remain in
full force and effect, and all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall be deemed to be severable in nature. If for any reason any term or
provision containing a restriction set forth herein is held to cover an area
or to be for a length of time which is unreasonable, or in any other way
is construed to be too broad or to any extent invalid, such term or
provision shall not be determined to be null, void and of no effect, but to
the extent the same is or would be valid or enforceable under applicable

enforceable area, time period and other provisions (not greater than those
contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under applicable Law.  
Article XI   SURVIVAL   11.1 Survival. All of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificates delivered
pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing and continue in full
force and effect until 9 months after the Closing (the "Survival Period"). If
any claim (including any Tax Claim or Environmental Claim) is made in
writing during the Survival Period, the representations and warranties
shall survive thereafter solely for purposes of resolving such claim.
The parties\' respective obligations with respect to covenants,
Nonwovens Liabilities and Excluded Liabilities shall not be subject to any
Survival Period.   11.2 Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of

alleges facts that, if true, would mean that there has been a breach) of any
of the representations, warranties or covenants of the Seller, any of the
Nonwovens Subsidiaries or any other subsidiary of the Seller, contained in
this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the Seller pursuant to this
Agreement and provided that the Buyer makes a written claim for
indemnification pursuant hereto within the applicable survival period, then
the Seller agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer from and
against all Damages the Buyer suffers resulting from, arising from, arising
out of, relating to, in the nature of or caused by such event; provided,
however, that the Seller shall have no liability with respect to any Damages
pursuant to this Section 11.2(a) unless and until the aggregate of all claims
for Damages hereunder and under Section 11.2(b) exceeds $250,000 and shall
thereafter be liable only for the amount of Damages in excess of $250,000 in
the aggregate; provided, further, that any indemnity with respect to income
Taxes (including the survival period with respect thereto) shall be governed
solely by Section 8.2.   (b) The Seller agrees to defend, indemnify, and
hold harmless the Buyer from and against all Damages the Buyer suffers, to
the extent (except as provided in (iv) below) arising from or relating to

or otherwise, for:   (i) any Environmental Claim with respect to the
Nonwovens  Business;   (ii) any notification, investigation, monitoring,
or  remediation of, or other response to, any emission, discharge,  release
or threatened release, or presence in the environment of  Hazardous Material,
whether on-site or off-site, with respect to  the Nonwovens Business, to the
extent required pursuant to  Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing
but specifically  excluding (y) any such activities required to maintain
compliance  with a permit or other Environmental Law with which the Seller
was  in compliance prior to and as of the Closing, or (z) any baseline 
investigation or similar investigative activity required after the  Closing
in connection with application for an IPPC or other permit  in the ordinary
course of business;   (iii) any failure of the Seller or its subsidiaries
or  the Nonwovens Business to comply, on or prior to the Closing, with  any
applicable Environmental Law or Environmental Permit,  including without
limitation Damages relating to any fines and  penalties and to any action
necessary to enable the Nonwovens  Business to come into compliance based on
the nature of the  operations of the Nonwovens Business as of the Closing
with  applicable Environmental Laws in effect as of the Closing; and   (iv)
non-income Taxes levied or imposed upon, or in  connection with, the
Nonwovens Assets or the Nonwovens Business  (including the Nonwovens
Subsidiaries) with respect to any taxable  period or portion thereof that
ends on or before the Effective  Time, to the extent that such non-income
Taxes arise after the  Effective Time or were otherwise not reflected on the
Closing Date  Balance Sheet (a "Tax Claim").  The Seller shall have no
obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless the Buyer pursuant to this
Section 11.2(b) unless and to the extent that the Buyer makes a written claim
for indemnification from the Seller within 9 months from the Closing;
provided, however, that the Seller shall have no liability with respect to
any Damages pursuant to this Section 11.2 unless and until the aggregate of
all claims for Damages hereunder and under Section 11.2(a) exceeds $250,000
and shall thereafter be liable only for (x) the amount of Damages in excess

described in clause (i), (ii) and (iii) above, 75% of such excess.   (c)
The parties shall promptly agree on the amount of the escrow to be retained
for the satisfaction of any claim presented by Buyer to Seller in accordance
with the terms of this indemnity. In the event the parties cannot agree
within 30 days after presentation of a claim of the type described in clause
(i), (ii) or (iii) of Section 11.2(b), the parties shall mutually appoint a
qualified environmental consultant to make such determination. In the event
that the parties cannot agree upon a consultant, each party shall appoint its
own consultant, and those consultants shall jointly appoint a third
consultant, who shall then make such determination. In the event the
appointed consultants shall fail to agree, the dispute shall be subject to
final and binding arbitration in New York, New York under and in accordance
with the rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber
of Commerce\'s International Court of Arbitration (the "ICC") then in
effect.   11.3 Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of the Seller. In

that, if true, would mean the Buyer has breached) any of its representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
the Buyer pursuant to this Agreement and provided that the Seller makes a
written claim for indemnification against the Buyer pursuant hereto within
the applicable survival period, then Purchaser agrees to defend, indemnify,
and hold harmless the Seller and the Nonwovens Subsidiaries from and against
the entirety of any Damages that the Seller and the Nonwovens Subsidiaries
suffer resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of or
caused by such event; provided, however, that the Seller shall have no
liability with respect to any Damages pursuant to this Section 11.3 unless
and until the aggregate of all claims for Damages hereunder exceeds $250,000
and shall thereafter be liable only for the amount of Damages in excess of
$250,000 in the aggregate.   11.4 Matters Involving Third Parties. If any
third party notifies any party hereto (the "Indemnified Party") in writing of
the assertion, or threatened assertion, of any claim with respect to
which indemnification is reasonably likely to be claimed by the Indemnified
Party against any other party hereto (the "Indemnifying Party") under
this Article XI (the "Third Party Claim"), then the Indemnified Party
will notify the Indemnifying Party thereof promptly after receiving such
written notice from the aforesaid third party; provided that no delay on the
part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless, and
then solely to the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnified Party may (through counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnifying Party) participate at its own expense in (but not
control) the Third Party Claim if it notifies the Indemnifying Party in
writing of its intention so to participate on or before the tenth (10th) day
following the date on which notice of such Third Party Claim was given to
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully in
the defense of the Third Party Claim as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party (such cooperation shall include the
retention and, upon the request of the Indemnifying Party, the provision to
such party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such claim or demand and making himself or his employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.   11.5 Statements as Representations.
All statements contained herein or in any schedule or certificate delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties as
such term is used in this Agreement.   11.6 Limitation on Indemnification.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the escrow agreement
to be entered into between the Buyer and the Seller in the form attached as
Exhibit D to the contrary, in no event shall the Seller be required to
indemnify any person pursuant to Section 11.2 or the Escrow Agreement for any
Damages exceeding the Escrow Amount.    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Seller and
the Buyer have caused this Agreement to be signed by their respective duly
authorized officers as of the date first above written.   AHLSTROM PAPER
