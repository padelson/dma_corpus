In no event shall the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance or other equitable remedies with respect to Parent&rsquo;s obligations to consummate the Merger other than solely under the specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in this <u>Section </u><u>9.7(c)</u>. In no event shall any Person other than the Company be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of any of Parent&rsquo;s or Merger Sub&rsquo;s obligations to consummate the Merger. In no event shall any Person other than Parent and/or Merger Sub be entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of the Company&rsquo;s obligations to consummate the Merger. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity; <i>provided</i>, that nothing contained in this sentence shall prohibit a party from opposing a grant of specific performance or other equitable relief on the basis that such remedy is not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, while the Company or Parent may pursue both a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent expressly permitted by this <u>Section </u><u>9.7</u> and the payment of Reverse Termination Fee or the Financing Failure Termination Fee, as applicable (only to the extent expressly permitted by <u>Section</u><u> 8.3(c)</u>) or the payment of the Termination Fee (only to the extent expressly permitted by <u>Section</u><u> 8.3(b)</u><u>)</u>, as applicable, under no circumstances shall Parent or the Company, as applicable, be obligated to both specifically perform its obligations to consummate the Merger, on the one hand, and pay the Reverse Termination Fee, Financing Failure Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, as applicable, on the other hand.</p>
