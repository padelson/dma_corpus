NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements

the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, and upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows:

 

AGREEMENT

ARTICLE I 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with
the DGCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub will cease, with the
Company surviving the Merger (the Company, as the surviving entity in the
Merger, sometimes being referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_
"), such that following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation will be a direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger will have the effects provided
in this Agreement and as specified in the DGCL.

Section 1.2  _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 8:00 a.m., Pacific Time, at the offices of Jones Day, 1755
Embarcadero Road, Palo Alto, California, on the third business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ to be satisfied or (to the extent permitted) waived (other than any such
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted) waiver of such
conditions at the Closing), unless another date or place is agreed to in
writing by the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing actually
takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ".

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, the Parties will cause
a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the " _Certificate of
Merger_ ") to be duly executed and filed with the DSOS as provided under the
DGCL and make any other filings, recordings or publications required to be
made by the Company or Merger Sub under the DGCL in connection with the
Merger. The Merger will become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the DSOS or on such later date and time as is agreed
to by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such
date and time being hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 Section 1.4 _Governing Documents_. Subject to _Section 6.4_ , at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity of further
action by the Company or any other Person, the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation will be amended and restated so as to read in its
entirety in the form set forth as the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation will provide that the name of the
Surviving Corporation will be the name designated by Parent prior to the
Effective Time), and as so amended will be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law. In addition, subject to _Section 6.4_ , the
Company and the Surviving Corporation will take all necessary action such
that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will be
amended so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended will be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.5 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving _ _Corporation_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity of further
action by the Company or any other Person, the individuals designated by
Parent prior to the Effective Time shall become the officers and directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective
Time, in accordance with the certificate of

 



-2- ##### Table of Contents

  

 incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors will have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

TREATMENT OF SECURITIES

 

Section 2.1 _Treatment of Securities_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties or holders of
any securities of the Company or of Merger Sub, subject to _Section 2.1(d)_ ,
each Company Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Company Shares to be cancelled in accordance with  _Section
2.1(b)_ and other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $22.50 plus the amount of
any Final Quarterly Dividend in accordance with _Section 6.11_ , if any (the
" _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), in each case, payable as provided in
_Section 2.2_. From and after the Effective Time, all Company Shares issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
all uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry
form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to
the Effective Time, represented any such Company Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ")) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each applicable holder of
such Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration applicable to
such Company Shares and any dividends payable pursuant to _Section 6.11_ , if
any, or the right to exercise Appraisal Rights in accordance with _Section
2.3_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, all Company
Shares owned by any Company Subsidiary, Parent, Merger Sub or by any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Treatment of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each issued
and outstanding share of common stock of Merger Sub shall be automatically
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustment_. Any number or amount herein that is based upon a number or
fraction of shares of Company Common Stock shall be adjusted appropriately to
reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 

Section 2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Merger Sub shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as the exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_
"). The Exchange Agent shall also act as the agent for the holders of Company
Common Stock for the purpose of receiving and holding their Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares and shall obtain no rights or interests in the shares
represented thereby. Within two business days after the Effective Time, Parent
or Merger Sub shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent cash in immediately available funds in an amount sufficient to pay the
aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ "),
in

 



-3- ##### Table of Contents

  

 each case, for the sole benefit of the holders of Company Shares. In the
event that the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to pay the aggregate amount
of all Per Share Merger Consideration, Parent shall, or shall cause Merger
Sub to, promptly deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount
which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment.
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to make, and the Exchange Agent shall
make, delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund
in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. The Exchange
Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) any investment of such cash shall in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or
in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers
acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on
the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly
available), and (2) no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
this _Article II_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (at the
election of Parent) on the earlier of (A) one year after the Effective Time or
(B) the full payment of the Exchange Fund.

 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any
event within three business days, after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
and whose Company Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_  into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in
exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration into which such
Company Shares have been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1_. Upon surrender
of a Certificate (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and a properly executed IRS Form W-8 or W-9, as
applicable, or any similar information from the recipients of payments
hereunder, Parent shall pay or cause the Exchange Agent to pay to the holder
of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange therefor the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_ for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share, within three business days following the later to occur of (x)
the Effective Time or (y) the Exchange Agents receipt of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Exchange Agent shall accept
such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange
Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
(A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (B) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not required to be paid. Payment of the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be
made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_ , without
interest thereon.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of

 



-4- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Company Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to
the Company Shares represented thereby except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund; No Liability_. At any time following 12
months after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the
Exchange Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received
with respect thereto) remaining in the Exchange Fund that have not been
disbursed, or for which disbursement is pending subject only to the Exchange
Agents routine administrative procedures, to holders of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only
to the Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.2(b)_ (with Parent acting as the Exchange Agent), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub, or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Per Share
Merger Consideration, dividends, or other amounts properly delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar applicable Law.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof (such affidavit
to be in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent),
the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ hereof and, as contemplated by _Section 6.11_ , at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date prior to the Effective Time and a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable in respect thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance
thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to
deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub or
the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

 Section 2.3 _Dissenter_ __ _s Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Company Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by holders of record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement (or consent thereto in writing) and are entitled to demand, and
have properly demanded, appraisal of such Company Shares (" _Dissenting
Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who have complied in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Rights_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to
_Section 2.1_ , but instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the
right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in
accordance with the Appraisal Rights (it being understood and acknowledged
that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto other than
the right to receive the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares to the
extent afforded by the Appraisal Rights); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder (including any holder of Proposed Dissenting Shares) shall fail
to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of
the fair value of such Dissenting Shares under the Appraisal Rights, then the
right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall automatically convert
into and shall represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 2.1_. " _Proposed Dissenting
Shares_ " means Company Shares the holder of which provides a demand for
appraisal to the Company prior to the Company Special Meeting and does not
vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, in each case in accordance
with the Appraisal Rights.

 



-5- ##### Table of Contents

  

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands received
prior to the Effective Time by the Company for the exercise of Appraisal
Rights, of any withdrawals of such demands and of any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to Appraisal Rights,
and Parent shall have the opportunity, at Parents expense, to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

the product of (x) the aggregate number of Company Shares subject to such
Company Option, and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger
Consideration over the applicable per share exercise price under such Company

outstanding and unexercised as of the Effective Time with a per share exercise
price that is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration,

any consideration therefor.

Common Stock subject to such Company RSU, and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration and (II) the cash dividend equivalents that have accrued but

canceled and converted at the Effective Time into an adjusted award having the
same terms and conditions as were in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including (A) the same vesting schedule (including rights to
acceleration of vesting and rights to post-termination vesting in connection
with retirement eligibility), (B) the same payment schedule (including
any deferral election) and (C) the right to receive dividend equivalents that
accrued by the Effective Time, except that such adjusted award shall be in the
form of an unfunded, unsecured promise of Parent to deliver to the holder
thereof an amount in cash equal to the RSU Payment.

(c) _MSUs_. With respect to each Company RSU (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that would otherwise
remain subject to an on-going corporate performance period as of the Closing
Date in the absence of the Transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each,
a " _Company MSU_ "), the Company shall accelerate the conclusion of the on-
going performance period to be the last business day prior to the Closing Date
(the " _MSU Measurement Date_ "), and shall measure performance for each such
Company MSU using actual performance as of the MSU Measurement Date. With
respect to each Company MSU that remains outstanding as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall be deemed, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to have earned and be fully vested in that
number of Company Shares determined based on such actual performance and the
payout formula set forth in the applicable award agreement (the " _Earned MSU
Shares_ ") and such Earned MSU Shares shall be treated in accordance with

(c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 5.2(a)_ , if, prior
to the Company Stockholder Approval being obtained, the Company receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Competing Proposal and the Company Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor that such Competing Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be likely to lead to a
Superior Proposal, then in either event the Company and its Representatives
may: (i) furnish information (including nonpublic information) to the Person
making such Competing Proposal, its Representatives and its potential sources
of financing, if, and only if, prior to so furnishing such information, the
Company receives (or has previously received) from such Person an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such Person, its Representatives and its potential sources
of financing with respect to such Competing Proposal and any changes thereto,
including by making counterproposals thereto. The Company will promptly
provide to Parent any material nonpublic information concerning the Company
provided to any other Person in connection with any Competing Proposal that
was not previously provided to Parent.

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24
hours) after, to the knowledge of the Company, the receipt of any Competing
Proposal and provide Parent with a copy of the Competing Proposal, including
any related debt and equity financing commitments (or if the Competing
Proposal is not in writing, a written description of the material terms
of the Competing Proposal). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed
of the status of discussions relating to any such Competing Proposal. The
Company will also promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after such
determination) advise Parent if the Company determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a Competing
Proposal pursuant to _Section 5.2(c)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_ to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a Company Change of
Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening Event if, and only if, (i)
the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor that the
failure to make a Company Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company
Board of Directors under applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
actions of the Company Board of Directors in making such determination and
such determination shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or
a violation of this _Section 5.2_ ), (ii) the Company has provided Parent
with a written notice of such determination and that the Company Board of
Directors intends to effect a Company Change of Recommendation ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the giving of such notice and actions of the Company Board
of Directors in authorizing and disclosing (to the extent legally required)
such notice shall not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation or a
violation of this _Section 5.2_) and (iii) during the four business day
period commencing on the date of Parents receipt of such notice the Company
has made its Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging
in discussions and negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment to this
Agreement and has considered in good faith any proposals made by Parent, and
after taking account of Parents proposals, if any, the Company Board of
Directors again makes the determination set forth in _Section 5.2(e)(i)_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_ to the
contrary, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board of Directors may in response to its receipt of a
_bona fide_ written Competing Proposal make a Company Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive written
agreement providing for such Competing Proposal pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_
if, and only if, (i) the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisor that (x) such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and (y) the failure to make such Company Change of Recommendation or
to terminate this Agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors
under applicable Law ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the actions of the
Company Board of Directors in making such determination and such
determination shall not constitute a Company Change of

 



-30- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Recommendation, a violation of this _Section 5.2_ or a termination of this
Agreement), (ii) the Company has provided Parent with a written notice of such
determination and that the Company Board of Directors intends to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation or that the Company intends to terminate this
Agreement ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the giving of such notice and
actions of the Company Board of Directors in authorizing and disclosing (to
the extent legally required) such notice shall not constitute a Company Change
of Recommendation, a violation of this _Section 5.2_ or a termination of this
Agreement) and (iii) during the four business day period commencing on the
date of Parents receipt of such notice the Company has made its
Representatives reasonably available for the purpose of engaging in
discussions and negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (to the
extent Parent desired to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment to this
Agreement and has considered in good faith any proposals made by Parent that
if accepted by the Company would be binding upon Parent, and after taking
account of Parents proposals, if any, the Company Board of Directors again
makes the determination set forth in _Section 5.2(f)(i)_. Each time the
financial or other material terms of such Competing Proposal are materially
amended, the Company will deliver to Parent a new notice, and the period of
negotiation provided in the foregoing sentence shall in no event end prior to
11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the second business day immediately following
Parents receipt of such notice and specified agreements, but no such new
notice shall shorten the original notice period.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from (i) disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if
the Company Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good faith after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor
that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the fiduciary duties of the members of the Company Board of Directors under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure referred to
in clauses (i) or (ii) that relates to a Competing Proposal shall be deemed to
be a Company Change of Recommendation unless (x) the Company Board of
Directors expressly reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in such
disclosure or (y) such disclosure is a "stop, look and listen" communication
to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(b) promulgated
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _further_ that this _Section 5.2(g)_
shall not permit the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of
Recommendation except to the extent permitted by  _Section 5.2(e)_ or
_Section 5.2(f)_.

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders_ __
_Meeting_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC (and
shall, in any event, use reasonable best efforts to prepare and cause to be
filed with the SEC within 20 business days following the date of this
Agreement) the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself, its affiliates and the
holders of its shares to the other and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by such other Party in connection with the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request
from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall,
as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent
with copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all written comments with respect to
the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and advise Parent of any oral
comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC. The
Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall
provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
document or response in advance and give due consideration to such comments,
except to the extent such disclosures relate to a Competing Proposal.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
affiliates, is discovered by the Company or Parent that, in

 



-31- ##### Table of Contents

  

 the reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy
Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties, and the
Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any
necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in
such amendment or supplement to stockholders of the Company. Nothing in this
_Section 5.3(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section
5.3(a)_. For purposes of this _Section 5.3_ , any information concerning or
related to the Company or its affiliates will be deemed to have been provided
by the Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its
affiliates will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 

(c) The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Governing Documents, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of
and schedule the Company Special Meeting. Subject to compliance with
applicable Law, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Proxy Statement is approved, or deemed to have been approved by the SEC
for dissemination to the stockholders of the Company, mail the Proxy
Statement to the stockholders of the Company and use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the
extent that the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Company Change
of Recommendation as permitted by _Section 5.2_. The Company shall consult
with Parent regarding the date of the Company Stockholder Meeting, which,
subject to the terms of the next sentence relating to postponement and
adjournment thereof, shall be held not later than 45 days after the mailing of
the Proxy Statement to the Companys stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 5.3(c)_ , the Company shall not
adjourn, postpone or delay the Company Special Meeting without the prior
consent of Parent, except that it may do so if and to the extent that: (i)
there are holders of an insufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock present or represented by a proxy at the Company Special Meeting to
constitute a quorum at the Company Special Meeting; (ii) the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval; (iii) such adjournment,
postponement, delay or cancellation is required by applicable Law or a request
from the SEC or its staff; or (iv) in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board of Directors (after consultation with its outside legal advisors), the
failure to adjourn, postpone or delay the Company Special Meeting would be
reasonably likely to not allow sufficient time under applicable Laws for the
distribution of any required or appropriate supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement.

Section 5.4 _Incorporation and Joinder of Merger Sub_. 

(a) Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, and in any event
within 10 days of the date of this Agreement, Parent shall incorporate, or
shall cause the incorporation of, Merger Sub under Delaware Law. Promptly
following the incorporation of Merger Sub, Parent shall deliver to the Company
a complete and correct copy of the Charter Documents of Merger Sub.

 

(b) Promptly following the incorporation of Merger Sub in accordance with
_Section 5.4(a)_ , and in any event within 10 days of the date hereof (and
prior to the execution of the Joinder Agreement by Merger Sub), Parent shall
cause the board of directors of Merger Sub to adopt this Agreement in
accordance with Delaware Law, and Parent shall or shall cause the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub to, adopt this Agreement in accordance with
Delaware Law.

within 10 days of the date hereof, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to execute a
joinder agreement to this Agreement, substantially in the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Joinder Agreement_ "). Effective upon the execution
and delivery of the Joinder Agreement, Merger Sub shall be deemed to be a
"Party" to this Agreement, and any obligations or agreements of Merger Sub set
forth herein shall thereafter be effective and binding upon Merger Sub. Upon
execution of the Joinder Agreement, the Joinder Agreement shall be deemed to
be part of, and a modification to, this Agreement, the representations and
warranties of Merger Sub in the Joinder Agreement shall be incorporated in
full into this

 



-32- ##### Table of Contents

  

 Agreement by reference (and shall be deemed to be made as if Merger Sub was
an original Party to this Agreement) and the Joinder Agreement shall be
governed by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement, which will
continue in full force and effect as modified by the Joinder Agreement as a
valid and binding agreement of the Parties (including Merger Sub).

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

Section 6.1 _Access; Confidentiality; Notice of Certain Events_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or the date, if
any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_ , to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
the Company Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance
notice to all of their properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably promptly to
Parent all information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required by this _Section 6.1_ to provide
Parent or its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (i)
that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or entered into after the
date of this Agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, (ii) the disclosure of which would violate any Law, (iii) that
is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege or (iv) that would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets
of the Company or any third parties. Parent will reasonably minimize any
disruption to the businesses of the Company that may result from the requests
for access, data and information hereunder.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 6.1_ or as set forth in
_Section 6.2_ , the Company may, as it deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided under this
_Section 6.1_ or under _Section 6.2_ as either "Antitrust Counsel Only
Material" or "Antitrust Restricted Material." Antitrust Counsel Only Material
and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside
antitrust counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside
counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless express
permission is obtained in advance from the Company or its legal counsel.
Antitrust Restricted Material and the information contained therein shall be
given only to outside antitrust counsel and other outside Representatives of
the recipient and employees, officers or directors of the recipient approved
by the Company, and will not be disclosed by such Persons to other employees,
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the Company or its legal counsel. Anything to the contrary
contained in this _Section 6.1_ or in _Section 6.2_ notwithstanding, materials
provided pursuant to this _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ may be redacted (i)
to remove references concerning the valuation of Parent, the Company and the
Merger and other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

(c) Parent will hold, and will cause its Representatives and affiliates to
hold, any nonpublic information, including any information exchanged pursuant
to this _Section 6.1_ or _Section 6.2_ , in confidence to the extent required
by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with, the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, (i) of any notice or other communication
received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions, or from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions, if
the subject matter of such communication or the

 



-33- ##### Table of Contents

  

 failure of such Party to obtain such consent could be material to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) of any Action commenced or,
to any Partys knowledge, threatened against, such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to, involving or affecting such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries, in each case in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Transactions, and (iii) upon becoming aware of the
occurrence or impending occurrence of any event or circumstance relating to it
or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively,
which would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the other
Partys obligation to effect the Merger or that would reasonably be expected
to prevent or materially delay or impede the consummation of the
Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this _Section 6.1(d)_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party. The failure to deliver any such notice shall not
affect any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ or give rise to any
right to terminate under _Article VIII_.

 

Section 6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions as soon as

other required submissions and respond as promptly as practicable to any
requests for additional information or documentary material) with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions (A) with the Antitrust Division of the

Specified Antitrust Authorities, as promptly as practicable, (ii) to prepare
and pre-file with CFIUS a draft joint voluntary notice and other appropriate

practicable after notification by CFIUS that the draft joint voluntary notice
satisfies all requirements of 31 C.F.R. § 800.402 and taking into account the
pendency of any approvals that may be required with respect to the FOCI
Requirements, jointly file with CFIUS a formal joint voluntary notice within
the meaning of 31 C.F.R. § 800.402, and as promptly as practicable (and in any
event in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements) any other
submissions that are formally requested by CFIUS to be made, or which the
Parties mutually agree should be made, in each case in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions, (iii) to prepare and submit as promptly as

filings, notices, applications or similar notifications or documents required
or advisable in order to obtain such approvals of DSS or any other
Governmental Authority as may be required for the Company to mitigate foreign
ownership, influence or control under any U.S. national industrial security
requirements or Laws (collectively, the " _FOCI Requirements_ ") and (v) to
promptly determine whether any other filings are required to be made with, and
whether any other consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required

 connection with the Transactions, and if so, to prepare and file any such
filings and to seek any such other consents, approvals, permits or
authorizations (the filings described in the foregoing clauses (i) through
(v) collectively, " _Regulatory Filings_ ").

(b) In connection with, and without limiting, the efforts or the obligations
of the Parties under _Section 6.2(a)_, each of Parent and the Company shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law and not prohibited by the applicable
Governmental Authority and subject to all applicable privileges (including
the attorney client privilege), (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in
the making of Regulatory Filings (including, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and subject to the provisions of _Section 6.1(b)_ ,
providing copies, or portions thereof, of all such documents to the non-
filing Parties prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith) and in connection with

Authority under any applicable Law with respect to any such filing, (ii)
supply the other with any information and reasonable assistance that may be
required or reasonably requested in connection with the making of such
filings, (iii) supply, within the time allowed, any additional or supplemental

(and any extension thereof) under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law (the
" _Antitrust Approvals_ "), (B) the CFIUS Approval, (C) the ITAR/EAR Approval
and (D) any approval required under the FOCI Requirements, in each case as

the Merger under any applicable Law, including using reasonable best efforts
to take all such action as reasonably may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, as the FTC, the DOJ, CFIUS, DSS or any other Governmental
Authority or Person may assert with respect to the Merger or the
other Transactions.

(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective affiliates, if

subject to all applicable privileges (including the attorney
client privilege), promptly inform the other of any material communication
from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the Transactions in
connection with any Regulatory Filings or investigations with, by or before
any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the Transactions,
including any Actions initiated by a private party. If any Party or Subsidiary
or other affiliate thereof shall receive a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to a
Regulatory Filing, then such Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. In connection with and without

provide each other with a reasonable advance opportunity to review and comment
upon, and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to, all
material written communications (including applications, analyses,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments and opinions) with a Governmental
Authority regarding the Merger or any other Transactions and (vi) provide
each other (or counsel of each Party, as appropriate) with copies of all
material written communications to or from any Governmental Authority relating
to the Merger or any other Transactions. Any such disclosures, rights to
participate or provisions of information by one Party to the other may be made
on a counsel-only basis to the extent required under applicable Law and the
provisions of _Section 6.1(b)_.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, except as set forth
in this _Section 6.2(d)_ , _Section 6.2(e)_ and _Section 6.2(f)_ , for
purposes of _Section 6.2_ only, in no event shall Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to, and, without the prior
written consent of Parent, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall (x) contest or resist any Action by a Governmental Authority that is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any of the Transaction
as violative of any Antitrust Law, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transaction, (y) consent to or take any actions to sell, hold separate
or otherwise dispose of any assets, businesses or interest, or (z) consent to
or take any other actions not described in the preceding clause (y), including
agreeing to conditions relating to, or making changes in the conduct of, its
business, that would reduce the reasonably anticipated benefits to Parent of
the Transactions in an amount that is financially material relative to the
value of the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole.

 

(e) In addition to and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 6.2_ , the Parties agree to enter into a
commitment letter with DSS prior to the Outside Date pursuant to which the
Parties will enter into a Proxy Agreement (as defined under the NISPOM) and
the FOCI Entity Plans with respect to the operations of the Company conducted
only at the Palm Bay Facility on the terms required by DSS or any other
applicable Governmental Authority (a " _DSS Commitment Letter_ "). The Parties
will enter into discussions immediately following the date of this Agreement
with DSS or any other applicable Governmental Authority with respect to such
DSS Commitment Letter, Proxy Agreement and FOCI Entity Plans and will finalize
negotiations with respect to such Proxy Agreement and FOCI Entity Plans as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, Parent shall have no obligation to enter into a DSS Commitment
Letter if DSS is not willing to agree to In-Scope FOCI Mitigation.

 

(f) The Company acknowledges Parents goal of seeking to minimize the scope of
the FOCI Requirements and Parents preference for a National Interest
Determination (as defined under the NISPOM) to permit the operation of the
activities of the Company under a Special Security Agreement (as defined under
the NISPOM) instead of a Proxy Agreement, and Parent acknowledges
the Companys goal of seeking a resolution with DSS as soon as possible after
the date of this Agreement. The Company shall (i) permit Parent to review and
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
to any documents related to the Proxy Agreement and the FOCI Entity Plans
that are submitted to DSS, and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to provide the
assistance needed to develop and establish the FOCI Entity Plans. Parent will
work in good faith to develop the FOCI Entity Plans as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the
Outside Date.

 

(g) The Company acknowledges Parents goal of seeking an end-of-life for any
Company Products that are subject to the NISPOM, either before or after the
Closing. The Company shall continue its discussions with all applicable
Governmental Authorities regarding implementing an end-of-life process for any
Company Products that are subject to the NISPOM, and the Company agrees to
keep Parent reasonably notified and informed of such discussions. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that the inability to obtain the consent of any
applicable Government Authority to such end-of-life process shall not limit in
any respect the obligation of the Parties pursuant to _Section 6.2(e)_ to
finalize negotiations with DSS or any other applicable Governmental Authority
with respect to the FOCI Requirements prior to the Outside Date and the
Parties further agree that all of the Companys obligations set forth in
_Section 6.2(f)_ and _Section 6.2(g)_ will be disregarded for purposes of
determining (i) whether the conditions set forth in _Section 7.2(b)_ have been
satisfied and (ii) whether the Parent Termination Fee has become due and
payable pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.2_ , neither
Parent, Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, shall
be required to (and the Company shall not, without Parents prior consent)
agree to any term or take or omit to take any action in connection with
obtaining the Antitrust Approvals, the CFIUS Approval, the ITAR/EAR Approval
or any approval required under the FOCI Requirements that is not conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.

(i) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain all consents, waivers, authorizations and approvals of all third
parties (other than Governmental Authorities, which are the subject of clauses
(a)-(h) above) necessary, proper or advisable in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions and to provide any notices to third parties
required to be provided by them prior to the Effective Time.

Section 6.3  _Publicity_. Parent and the Company have agreed upon the initial
joint press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement, and will
issue such press release promptly following the execution of this Agreement.

Parent, nor any of their respective affiliates, shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to
the Transactions or this Agreement without the prior consent of the other

officers and employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and each
Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, together with such Persons
heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, the " _Covered Persons_ ") to
the fullest extent permitted by Law against any costs and expenses (including
advancing attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Covered Person to the
fullest extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened Action or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons
serving as an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity at the
request or for the benefit of the Company). Without limiting the foregoing,
from and after the Effective Time, Parent, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the Covered Persons to the

with the process resulting in and the adoption and approval of this Agreement

Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall advance expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the defense of any
Action or investigation with respect to the matters subject to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.4(a)_ in accordance with the
procedures (if any) set forth in the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws, or other organizational or
governance 

 



-37- ##### Table of Contents

  

 documents, of any Company Subsidiary, and indemnification agreements, if
any, in existence on the date of this Agreement. In the event of any such
Action or investigation, Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation
shall cooperate with the Covered Person in the defense of any such Action or
investigation.

(b) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification of and advancement of expenses to Covered Persons for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if any Action or investigation (whether arising before, at or after
the Effective Time) is made against any Covered Person with respect to matters
subject to indemnification hereunder on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the provisions of this _Section 6.4(b)_  shall continue
in effect until the final disposition of such Action or investigation.

Surviving Corporation, without any further action, and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 

(c) For not less than six years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, maintain for the benefit of the Covered Persons, an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring prior to

to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries relating to errors and
omissions of directors and officers or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the last annual premium
paid prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as
much coverage as is available for such amount. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time (which the
Company shall be permitted to purchase prior to the Effective Time), which
policies provide such directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of the Transactions. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

 

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.4_.

 

(e) The rights of each Covered Person pursuant to this _Section 6.4_ shall be
in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Covered
Person may have under the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws (or similar
documents of any Company Subsidiary), any Contract, or under applicable Law.
The provisions of this _Section 6.4_ shall survive the Effective Time and
shall not be terminated or modified in any manner that is adverse to the
Covered Persons (and their respective successors and assigns), it being
expressly agreed that the Covered Persons (including their respective
successors and assigns) shall be third party beneficiaries of, and entitled
to enforce, this _Section 6.4_. In the event of any breach by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent of this _Section 6.4_ , the Surviving Corporation shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred
by Covered Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided
in this _Section 6.4_ as such fees are incurred upon the written request of
such Covered Person.

exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future
officers, directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or affiliates

and upon payment of such amount (if entitled under this _Section 8.2(b)_ ),
none of the Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions,
including the Merger (except that the Company shall also be obligated with
respect to _Section 8.2_ , to the extent applicable, and except that the
Company shall remain obligated for, and Parent and its affiliates may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the provisions and agreements surviving

while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue both a grant of specific performance of
the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger in accordance with _Section
9.14(b)_ and the payment of the Company Termination Fee under this _Section
8.2(b)_, under no circumstances shall Parent and Merger Sub be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of such specific performance requiring the
Company to consummate the Merger and to pay the Company Termination Fee (if
entitled under this _Section 8.2(b)_ ). In any circumstance where performance
by the Company of its obligations under this Agreement would relieve the
Company of its obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee, Parent and
Merger Sub may, in their sole discretion (i) seek specific performance
pursuant to _Section 9.14(b)_ , (ii) withdraw any claim for specific
performance and require payment of the Company Termination Fee if entitled to

entitled to payment of the Termination Fee under this _Section 8.2(b)_. For

Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

has not entered into a DSS Commitment Letter that continues in full force and
effect, and (D) this Agreement is terminated by either the

 Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ , then Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Company (x) if such termination was by Parent, prior
to or substantially concurrently with, and as a condition to, such
termination, or (y) if such termination was by the Company, within five
business days of such termination, an amount in cash equal to $96,500,000 (the
" _Parent Termination Fee_ ").

 

(ii) In the event any amount is payable pursuant to the preceding clause (i)
such amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Company. In no event shall Parent be
obligated to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

 

(iii) Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge that (A) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that
without this _Section 8.2_ the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement and (B) the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions. If Parent fails to promptly pay any
amount due pursuant to this _Section 8.2(c)_ , Parent shall pay to the Company
all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of enforcement (including
reasonable attorneys fees as well as reasonable expenses incurred in
connection with any action initiated by the Company), together with interest
on the amount of the Parent Termination Fee at the prime lending rate as
published in _The Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment
is required to be made. Except in the case of fraud or a willful and material
breach of Parents or Merger Subs representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to termination of this
Agreement, and subject to the Companys rights set forth in _Section 9.14(b)_
, the Companys right to receive payment from Parent of the Parent Termination
Fee (under the circumstances in which it is payable) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against Parent, the Parent
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future officers,
directors, partners, stockholders, managers, members or affiliates
(collectively, " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for any loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Transactions, including the Merger, to be consummated or
for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment
of such amount (if entitled under this _Section 8.2(c)_ ), none of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, including the Merger
(except that Parent and Merger Sub shall also be obligated with respect to
_Section 8.2_ , to the extent applicable, and except that Parent and Merger
Sub shall remain obligated for, and the Company and its affiliates may be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the provisions and agreements surviving
such termination pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ ). For the avoidance of doubt,
while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance of the
obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger in accordance
with _Section 9.14(b)_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee under
this _Section 8.2(c)_ , under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of such specific performance requiring
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and to pay the Parent
Termination Fee (if entitled under this _Section 8.2(c)_ ). In any
circumstance where performance by Parent of its obligations under
this Agreement would relieve Parent of its obligation to pay the Parent
Termination Fee, the Company may, in its sole discretion (i) seek specific
performance pursuant to _Section 9.14(b)_ , (ii) withdraw any claim for
specific performance and require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if
entitled to payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this _Section 8.2(c)_
or (iii) if the Company is unable for any reason to obtain specific
performance, require payment of the Parent Termination Fee if entitled to
payment of the Parent Termination Fee under this _Section 8.2(c)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

This JOINDER AGREEMENT (this "Joinder Agreement") dated as of [ _
_], 2016, is by and between Chapter One Company, a Delaware corporation
("Merger Sub") and Intersil Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in the
Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, on September 12, 2016, the Company and Renesas Electronics
Corporation, a Japanese corporation ("Parent"), entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Parent and the
Company agreed to effect the Merger upon the terms and subject to conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement; and

 

WHEREAS, as a condition to the obligations of the Company to effect the
Merger, the Merger Agreement provides that Merger Sub must enter into, and
deliver to the Company a duly executed copy of, this Joinder Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the undersigned hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I  JOINDER; PART OF MERGER AGREEMENT

 

Merger Sub hereby becomes a party to the Merger Agreement and to be bound to
the Merger Agreement as "Merger Sub" and a "Party". Merger Sub hereby
confirms all of the covenants and agreements set forth with respect to Merger
Sub in the Merger Agreement.

 

This Joinder Agreement shall be deemed to be part of, and a modification to,
the Merger Agreement and shall be governed by all the terms and provisions of
the Merger Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect as
modified hereby as a valid and binding agreement of Merger Sub.

 

ARTICLE II  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Merger Sub represents and warrants to the Company as set forth below.

 

Section 2.1 _Corporate Organization_. Merger Sub is a corporation organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of
Delaware, is directly and wholly owned by Parent, and has the requisite
corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate all of its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Merger
Sub is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
duly qualified or licensed and in good standing would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

Section 2.2 _Charter Documents and Bylaws_. Merger Sub has made available to
the Company a complete and correct copy of the certificate of incorporation
and bylaws, or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to date
(such certificates of incorporation and bylaws or equivalent organizational
documents collectively referred to as "Charter Documents") of Merger Sub. Such
Charter Documents are in full force and effect. Merger Sub is not in material
violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

to, any Governmental Authority, except (i) any filings as may be required
