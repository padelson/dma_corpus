into Save-A-Lot. Save-A-Lot shall be the Surviving Entity in the Merger and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of
Missouri. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate limited liability
company existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

2.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
articles of merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Missouri (the "Articles of Merger"). The term "Effective Time" shall be the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles
of Merger. 

2.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the Missouri LLC
Act.

2.4 Conversion of Securities. At and after the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Save-A-Lot, Purchaser or the
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) Units.

(i) Each Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to (A)
the Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.11) divided by
(B) the number of Units issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "Merger Consideration").

(ii) All of the Units converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Article II shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective
Time, and each certificate (each, a "Certificate") previously representing any
such Units shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any dividends or distributions which the holder thereof has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.7. Certificates previously
representing Units shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration upon the
surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.7, without any
interest thereon.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at the
Effective Time, all Units that are owned by Save-A-Lot, Merger Sub or
Purchaser (in each case other than in a fiduciary or agency capacity or as a
result of debts previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor, and
such Units shall not be counted for purposes of clause (i)(B) of Section
2.4(a).

(b) Merger Sub Shares. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one membership unit of the Surviving Entity.

(c) Supervalu and Purchaser Shares. At and after the Effective Time, each
share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Purchaser and each share of common
stock, par value $0.01, of Supervalu ("Supervalu Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall remain issued and
outstanding and shall not be affected by the Merger.

2.5 Certificate of Formation of Surviving Entity. At the Effective Time, the
Articles of Organization of Save-A-Lot, as in effect at the Effective Time,
shall be the Articles of Organization of the Surviving Entity until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law. 

2.6 Managers and Officers of Surviving Entity. The members of the Board of
Directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
constitute all of the initial members of the Board of Managers of the
Surviving Entity and shall hold office until their respective successors are
duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.
The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
constitute all of the initial officers of the Surviving Entity and shall hold
office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, or
their earlier death, resignation or removal.

2.7 Closing.

(a) The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and

time, on the first Business Day of the first Fiscal Period of Supervalu
beginning at least three (3) Business Days after the date on which all of the
conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied or waived on the Closing Date, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions on the Closing Date) are
satisfied or waived; provided, however, that if the Marketing Period has not
ended at least three (3) Business Days prior to the date on which the Closing
would otherwise occur, the Closing shall instead occur on the earlier to occur

first Business Day of the first Fiscal Period of Supervalu beginning at least
three (3) Business Days after Purchaser provides notice of such date to
Supervalu, (B) a date specified by Supervalu in a written notice delivered to
Purchaser at least three (3) Business Days' prior to such specified date (such
written notice to include written confirmation by Supervalu that Supervalu and

and records on a timely basis necessary to permit the balance sheet and
financial statements required by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of Section
5.14(a) to be prepared by the applicable deadlines set forth therein) that is
(I) at least two (2) Business Days following the final day of the Marketing
Period (as it may be extended pursuant to the definition of "Marketing
Period") (irrespective of whether such day is the first Business Day of a
Fiscal Period) and (II) (x) a Business Day during the period on or after
December 19, 2016 until and including January 3, 2017 or (y) the first
Business Day of any week after January 3, 2017 or (C) the first Business Day
of the first Fiscal Period of Supervalu beginning at least two (2) Business
Days immediately following the final day of the Marketing Period (as it may be
extended pursuant to the definition of "Marketing Period"), subject, in each
case, to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII as of the date determined pursuant to this proviso (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived on the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at
such time), or (ii) at such other place, time or date as may be mutually
agreed upon in writing by Supervalu and Purchaser; provided that the Closing
shall not occur earlier than December 5, 2016. The date on which the Closing
occurs is the "Closing Date."

(b) At the Closing, Supervalu shall:

(i) deliver to Purchaser certificates evidencing the Units to the extent that
such Units are in certificate form, duly endorsed in blank or with unit powers

Section 8.2(c);

(iii) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, as

Section 336(e)/338(h)(10) Entities;

(v) deliver to Purchaser the resignation, effective as of the Closing, of
those directors and officers of any Save-A-Lot Entity designated by Purchaser
to Supervalu in writing at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date;

(vi) deliver to Purchaser one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 or such
other forms and documents, in each case, required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 7.1(c); and

(vii) cause Save-A-Lot to deliver to Purchaser a counterpart to the Articles
of Merger executed by Save-A-Lot reflecting the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and in proper form for filing with the Missouri Secretary of State
in order to cause the Merger to become effective pursuant to the Missouri LLC
Act.

(c) At the Closing, Purchaser shall:

(i) deliver to Supervalu (or to any Affiliate of Supervalu designated by
Supervalu) by wire transfer, to an account or accounts designated prior to the
Closing by Supervalu (or by such Affiliate), immediately available funds in
cash in an aggregate amount equal to the Purchase Price (as estimated for
purposes of the Closing pursuant to Section 2.8);

(ii) deliver to Supervalu the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 8.3(c);

(iii) execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to
Supervalu, on behalf of Save-A-Lot, the Services Agreement;

(vi) to the extent required by Missouri Law, cause Merger Sub to deliver to
Supervalu a tax clearance certificate or its equivalent issued by the Missouri
Department of Revenue as of a recent date.

2.8 Closing Adjustment.

(a) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, Supervalu shall provide Purchaser with a statement setting forth its
good-faith estimates of Cash, Working Capital and Indebtedness as of the
Closing (the "Estimated Closing Statement"), and such schedules with respect
to the determination thereof as Supervalu believes is reasonably necessary to
support such Estimated Closing Statement, which shall be accompanied by a
notice (the "Closing Notice") that sets forth (i) Supervalu's determination of
the Closing Adjustment and the Purchase Price after giving effect to the
Closing Adjustment and (ii) the account or accounts to which Purchaser shall
transfer the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.7.

(b) The Closing Notice shall specify an amount (the "Closing Adjustment"),
positive or negative, that shall be equal to (i) the amount of Cash set forth
in the Estimated Closing Statement, plus (ii) the amount of Working Capital
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, less (iii) the Target Working
Capital Amount, less (iv) the amount of Indebtedness set forth in the
Estimated Closing Statement (it being understood that the amount of the Debt
Financing will not be considered Indebtedness for purposes of the Closing
Adjustment).

(c) The Estimated Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
definitions of "Cash", "Working Capital" and "Indebtedness" (as applicable and
without duplication) set forth herein based on the Accounting Standard,
applied consistently with their application in connection with the preparation
of the Audited Financial Statements.

2.9 Post-Closing Statements.

(a) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Supervalu shall prepare and
deliver to Purchaser a statement of Cash, Working Capital and Indebtedness as
of the Closing (the "Initial Post-Closing Statement"), together with such
schedules with respect to the determination thereof as Supervalu believes is
reasonably necessary to support such Initial Post-Closing Statement. The
Initial Post-Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
definitions of "Cash", "Working Capital" and "Indebtedness" (as applicable)
set forth herein based on the Accounting Standard, applied consistently with
their application in connection with the preparation of the Audited Financial
Statements.

(b) Following the Closing through the date that the Final Post-Closing
Statement becomes final and binding, Supervalu and their representatives shall
be permitted, to the extent reasonably requested in connection with
Supervalu's preparation of the Initial Post-Closing Statement and
participation in the reconciliation procedures set forth in Section 2.10, to
access the books, records and work papers (subject to entering into any
customary access letters required by accountants) of the Save-A-Lot Entities,
and Purchaser shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts 

to cause its accountants and other representatives to, cooperate with and
assist Supervalu in connection therewith, including by providing reasonable
access to such books, records and work papers and making available, during
normal business hours, personnel to the extent reasonably required for
purposes of Supervalu's preparation of the Initial Post-Closing Statement and
participation in the reconciliation procedures set forth in Section 2.10.

(c) Purchaser agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the
Final Post-Closing Statement becomes final and binding, it will not take or
permit to be taken any actions with respect to any accounting books, records,
policies or procedures on which the Business Financial Statements or the
Initial Post-Closing Statement is based, or on which the Final Post-Closing
Statement is to be based, that are inconsistent with the Accounting Standard
or that would alter or materially impede or delay the determination of the
amount of Working Capital or Indebtedness as of the Closing Date or the
preparation of any Notice of Disagreement or the Final Post-Closing Statement
in the manner and utilizing the methods provided by this Agreement.

2.10 Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements.

(a) Purchaser shall notify Supervalu in writing no later than sixty (60) days
after Purchaser's receipt of the Initial Post-Closing Statement if Purchaser
disputes the correctness of the Initial Post-Closing Statement, which notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute (the "Notice of
Disagreement"). If no Notice of Disagreement is delivered to Supervalu by
Purchaser within sixty (60) days after Purchaser's receipt of the Initial
Post-Closing Statement, then the Initial Post-Closing Statement shall be
deemed to have been accepted by Purchaser and shall become final and binding
upon the Parties in accordance with Section 2.10(c).

(b) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice
of Disagreement (the "Resolution Period"), Supervalu and Purchaser shall seek
in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to
the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement.

(c) If at the end of the Resolution Period, Supervalu and Purchaser have been
unable to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, Supervalu and Purchaser shall
submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of
Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Post-Closing Statement marked
to indicate those line items that are in dispute, together with each Party's
good faith value for such line item) to Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP or, if
such firm is unwilling or unable to fulfill such role, (i) another independent
certified public accounting firm in the United States of national reputation
mutually acceptable to Supervalu and Purchaser or (ii) if Supervalu or
Purchaser are unable to agree upon another such a firm within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of the Resolution Period, then within an
additional ten (10) Business Days, Supervalu and Purchaser shall each select
one such firm and those two firms shall, within ten (10) Business Days after
their selection, select a third (3rd) such firm (Baker Tilly Virchow Krause,
LLP, the firm selected in accordance with clause (i) or the third firm
selected in accordance with (ii), as applicable, the "Independent Accounting
Firm"). Within thirty (30) days after the Independent Accounting Firm's
selection, the Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final determination,
binding on the Parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of
the line items in the Initial Post-Closing Statement that remain in dispute as
indicated in the Notice of Disagreement that Supervalu and 

Purchaser have submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall have authority to resolve solely the matters submitted
to it in the Notice of Disagreement (provided that the authority of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to resolving accounting and
calculation issues and shall not include procedural or legal issues) and shall
determine the amount of the line items in dispute in accordance with this
Agreement. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not
in accordance with the position of either Supervalu or Purchaser, shall not be
in excess of the higher, or less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by
Purchaser in the Notice of Disagreement or by Supervalu in the Initial Post-
Closing Statement with respect to such disputed line item. The statement of
Cash, Working Capital and Indebtedness that is final and binding on the
Parties, as determined either through agreement of the Parties pursuant to
Section 2.10(a) or Section 2.10(b) or through the action of the Independent
Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), is referred to as the "Final
Post-Closing Statement."

(d) All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Supervalu, on the one
hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand. During the review by the Independent
Accounting Firm, Purchaser and Supervalu shall, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause their respective accountants to, each make available to the
Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such personnel, and such
information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably required
by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under Section
2.10(c); provided, that the accountants of Supervalu or Purchaser shall not be
obliged to make any work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm
except in accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and
then only after such Independent Accounting Firm has signed a customary
agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants. In acting under this Agreement, the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be entitled to the privileges and immunities
of an arbitrator.

2.11 Post-Closing Adjustment. The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be an
amount, positive or negative, equal to (a) an amount, positive or negative,
equal to (i) the amount of Cash set forth in the Final Post-Closing Statement
less (ii) the amount of Cash set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement,
plus (b) an amount, positive or negative, equal to (i) the amount of Working
Capital set forth in the Final Post-Closing Statement less (ii) the amount of
Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, less (c) an
amount, positive or negative, equal to (i) the amount of Indebtedness set
forth in the Final Post-Closing Statement less (ii) the amount of Indebtedness
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement. If the Post-Closing Adjustment
is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay to Supervalu (or one or more
Affiliates designated by Supervalu) by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in cash the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing
Adjustment is a negative amount, then Supervalu (or an Affiliate designated by
Supervalu) shall pay to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in cash the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment.
Any such payment shall be made within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Post-Closing Statement becomes such, together with interest thereon at the
Interest Rate from the Closing Date until the date of payment.

2.12 Withholding. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Parties
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such 

amounts as they are required to deduct and withhold pursuant to applicable Law
(it being agreed and understood that if any deduction or withholding shall be
made from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement by or on
behalf of Purchaser, Save-A-Lot or Merger Sub to or on behalf of Supervalu and
such deduction or withholding would not have been imposed if the Person making
such deduction or withholding were a United States person as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code with tax presence only in the United States
("Excess Withholding"), then Purchaser shall pay Supervalu such additional
amounts as shall result in Supervalu receiving the amount it would have
received had no such Excess Withholding applied). To the extent that amounts
are so deducted or withheld and are timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authority, such deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction or withholding was made.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SUPERVALU

Except as set forth in, or qualified by any matter set forth in, (a) the
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by Supervalu
with, or furnished by Supervalu to, after January 1, 2015, the SEC and
publicly available at least five (5) Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement (other than disclosures in any exhibits or schedules thereto or in
any documents incorporated by reference therein and other than any forward
looking disclosures set forth in any risk factor section and any other
disclosures included therein to the extent they are predictive or forward-
looking in nature), to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to the
Save-A-Lot Entities or the Business is reasonably apparent, (b) the Save-A-Lot
Registration Statement, or (c) the disclosure schedules delivered to Purchaser
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Save-A-Lot Disclosure
Schedules"), Supervalu hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

(a) Supervalu is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and Save-A-Lot is a limited
liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of Missouri.

(b) Each of the Save-A-Lot Entities other than Save-A-Lot is a corporation or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole. Supervalu and each
Save-A-Lot Entity has all requisite corporate or other organizational power
and authority to carry on its businesses as now being conducted and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation or
other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, in each case except as has not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business
Material Adverse Effect.

3.2 Capitalization of the Save-A-Lot Entities.

(a) The Units are duly authorized and validly issued and owned by Supervalu,
free and clear of all Liens, except for, prior to the Closing, Permitted
Liens. Except for the Units and 

any interest held by a Save-A-Lot Entity, there are no membership units,
shares of capital stock or other equity interests or securities of any Save-A-
Lot Entity authorized, reserved, issued or outstanding, and there are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, subscriptions, options, warrants, unit
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, convertible,
exercisable, or exchangeable securities or other instruments, agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or
unissued share capital or other ownership or equity interest in any of the
Save-A-Lot Entities or any other securities or obligations convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to
subscribe for or acquire, any securities of any Save-A-Lot Entity, and no
securities evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or outstanding, nor
have any such equity interests been issued in violation of any preemptive
rights, any purchase option or any rights of first refusal. None of the Save-
A-Lot Entities has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes, or other
obligations or Contracts that provide the holders thereof or counterparty
thereto (as applicable) the right to vote (or are convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the
stockholders of such Save-A-Lot Entity on any matter. Section 3.2(a) of the
Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules sets forth the percentages of outstanding
equity securities of each Save-A-Lot Entity owned by any other Save-A-Lot
Entity, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as
a whole: (i) all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each Save-A-Lot Entity have been duly authorized, validly
issued, and are fully paid and non-assessable; (ii) except as set forth in
Section 3.2(b)(ii) of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules, none of the Save-A-
Lot Entities owns any shares of capital stock or other equity interests in any
other Person or is obligated to purchase or acquire any such shares or other

violation of any applicable Law.

3.3 Authority Relative to this Agreement. Supervalu, Save-A-Lot and each of
their Affiliates that is party to the Services Agreement have all necessary
corporate or similar power and authority, and each has taken all corporate or
similar action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and
the Services Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Services Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof and
thereof. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Supervalu and Save-A-Lot, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser and Merger Sub, constitutes, and the
Services Agreement when executed and delivered by Supervalu, Save-A-Lot and/or
their Affiliates (as applicable) thereto, and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Services Agreement by Purchaser or its
applicable Affiliates, will constitute, a valid, legal and binding agreement
of Supervalu, Save-A-Lot and/or their Affiliates (as applicable), enforceable
against such member in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any
applicable Laws relating to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or preferential transfers, or similar Laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to the effect of general principles of equity (the
"Enforceability Exceptions"). 

3.4 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. No filing with or notice to, and no
permit, authorization, registration, consent or approval of, any Governmental
Authority is required on the part of Supervalu or its Affiliates (as
applicable) for the execution, delivery and performance by Supervalu or its
Affiliates (as applicable) of this Agreement or the Services Agreement or the
consummation by Supervalu or its Affiliates (as applicable) of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except (a) compliance with and

Property"), except for such leases, subleases, licenses, concessions or other
agreements as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as
a whole. Since January 1, 2014 until the date hereof, none of Supervalu or any
of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental
Authority of any condemnation, expropriation or other proceeding in eminent
domain pending or threatened, against any Core Real Property or any material
portion thereof or material interest therein, and, to the Knowledge of
Supervalu, no such pending or threatened proceedings exist, except as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material
to the Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole. None of the
Core Real Property is subject to or encumbered by any purchase option, right

dispose of such Core Real Property, except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business and the
Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole.

(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules sets forth an
accurate and complete list, including owner, jurisdiction, and serial and

Intellectual Property").

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

any third party; and (iv) to the Knowledge of Supervalu, no third party is
currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the Business
Intellectual Property that is material to the Business as conducted as of the
date of this Agreement. To the Knowledge of Supervalu, the registered Business
Intellectual Property is valid and enforceable, or to the extent such items
are applications, are pending without challenge (other than office actions and

reasonable steps to safeguard the security of the IT Systems. To the Knowledge
of Supervalu, there have been no unauthorized intrusions or breaches of the
security of the IT Systems since January 1, 2014 that, pursuant to any legal
requirement, would require Supervalu or a Save-A-Lot Entity to notify

2014, there has been no written allegation against the Save-A-Lot Entities of
loss, theft, unauthorized disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, any
Personal Information held by or on behalf of the Save-A-Lot Entities.

3.19 Sufficiency of Assets. At the Closing, the Save-A-Lot Entities will,
taking into account the Separation Agreement, the Services Agreement and all
of the assets, real property and services to be provided, acquired, leased or

the Save-A-Lot Entities in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Services Agreement.

3.21 Regulatory Matters.

(a) The Save-A-Lot Entities hold, and are operating in compliance with, such
permits, licenses, franchises, approvals, authorizations, certifications and
clearances of the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the
United States Department of Agriculture ("USDA") or other Governmental
Authority required for the conduct of the Business as currently conducted
(collectively, the "Regulatory Permits"), except where the failure to hold or
operate in compliance with the Regulatory Permits would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business and
the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole. Since January 1, 2014, the Save-A-
Lot Entities have fulfilled and performed all of their material obligations
with respect to the Regulatory Permits, and no event has occurred which
allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or
termination thereof or results in any other material impairment of the rights
of the holder of any Regulatory Permit, except where the failure to so fulfill
or perform, or the occurrence of such event, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Business and the Save-
A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole. Since January 1, 2014, the Save-A-Lot
Entities have operated and currently are in compliance with applicable
statutes and implementing regulations administered or enforced by the FDA or
the USDA, except where the failure to so comply has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Business
Material Adverse Effect. The Save-A-Lot Entities have not received written
notice since January 1, 2014 of any pending or threatened claim, suit,
proceeding, hearing, enforcement, audit, investigation, arbitration or other
action from the FDA, USDA, or other Governmental Authority alleging that any
operation or activity of the Business is in violation of any applicable Laws,
except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. 

(b) All applications, notifications, submissions, information, claims, reports
and statistics, and other data and conclusions derived therefrom, utilized as
the basis for or submitted in connection with any and all requests for a
Regulatory Permit by the Save-A-Lot Entities from the FDA, USDA or other
Governmental Authority relating to the Business and its products were true,
complete and correct as of the date of submission, except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole.

(c) The Business has not had since January 1, 2014 any product or distribution
site subject to a Governmental Authority (including FDA and USDA) shutdown,
nor received any FDA Form 483 or other Governmental Authority notice of
inspectional observations or warning letters to make changes to the Business
products, composition, labeling or packaging, that if not complied with has
resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in a Business Material
Adverse Effect.

(d) Section 3.21(d) of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and accurate list of all recalls, field notifications, field
corrections, market withdrawals or replacements, product warnings, safety
alerts and other notices of action relating to an alleged lack of safety or
regulatory compliance ("Safety Notices") since January 1, 2014 with respect to
any product manufactured by or, to the Knowledge of Supervalu, on behalf of,
the Business pursuant to Business specifications, except for those that have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Business Material Adverse Effect. To Supervalu's Knowledge, as of
the date hereof there are no product complaints with respect to any product
manufactured by or on behalf of the Business pursuant to the Business
specifications that would be reasonably likely to result in (A) a Safety
Notice, or (B) a termination or suspension of manufacturing or marketing of
any the Business products, in each case, except as has not had and would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Business
Material Adverse Effect.

3.22 Licensee Contracts.

(a) Section 3.22(a) of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules contains a complete
and correct list of all Save-A-Lot stores operated under Significant Licensee
Contracts, including the name of the licensee and store location. True and
correct copies of all Significant Licensee Contracts in effect as of the date
of this Agreement have been made available to Purchaser. To the actual
knowledge of any Person listed in Section 1.1(a) of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure
Schedules, as of the date hereof, no licensee under any Licensee Contract is
insolvent, the subject of a pending case under any Law regarding bankruptcy,
insolvency or receivership, or has in the past seven (7) years made an
assignment for the benefit of its creditors.

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as
a whole, neither the Save-A-Lot Entities nor, to the Knowledge of Supervalu,
any licensee is in default under any Significant Licensee Contract. In the
twelve (12) months prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) no licensee under
a Significant Licensee Contract has given written notice to Save-A-Lot or
Supervalu of its intention to assign, transfer, rescind or terminate any
Significant Licensee Contract or to close any 

store operating under any such Significant Licensee Contract and (ii) neither
Supervalu or any of the Save-A-Lot Entities has given written notice of its
intention to terminate any Licensee Contract.

(c) Since January 1, 2012, neither the Save-A-Lot Entities nor Supervalu has
(i) received any written notice from any Governmental Authority or from any
licensee under a Licensee Contract with respect to any alleged violation of
any Franchise Law or (ii) been a party to any Action brought by a Governmental
Authority alleging a violation of any Franchise Law, in each case except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material to the Business and the Save-A-Lot Entities, taken as a whole.

3.23 Separation Agreement. As of the date of this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement is a valid, binding obligation of Supervalu, Save-A-Lot and their
respective Subsidiaries, and enforceable in accordance with its terms, and is
in full force and effect, and, as of the date hereof, no event has occurred
that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both, would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Supervalu under the
terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement. As of the date hereof, the
Separation Agreement has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived on or prior to the date of this Agreement.

3.24 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in Article IV or in the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 8.3(c), Supervalu acknowledges that none of Purchaser or
any other Person or entity on behalf of Purchaser has made, and Supervalu has
not relied upon, any representation or warranty, whether express or implied,
including with respect to Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities, financial condition, results of
operations, future operating or financial results, estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or with
respect to the accuracy or completeness of any other information provided or
made available to Supervalu by or on behalf of Purchaser.

4.6 Financing.

(a) Purchaser and Merger Sub have received and accepted an executed and
binding commitment letter dated October 16, 2016, as may be amended, modified
or replaced in accordance with Section 5.11(a) hereof (the "Debt Commitment
Letter") from Citigroup Global Market Inc., Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse
Securiites (USA) LLC, Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch and
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (as such parties may be supplemented or amended
in accordance with Section 5.11(a) hereof, collectively, the "Lenders"),
relating to the commitment of the Lenders to provide, subject only to the
terms and conditions thereof, the full amount of the debt financing stated
therein (the "Debt Financing").

(b) Purchaser and Merger Sub have received and accepted an executed and
binding commitment letter dated October 16, 2016 (the "Equity Commitment
Letter" and, together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the "Commitment

commitment of the Equity Investor, subject only to the terms and conditions
thereof, to invest in Purchaser the full amount of the cash equity financing

the "Financing"). Purchaser has delivered to Supervalu true, complete and
correct copies of the executed Commitment Letters and any fee letters related
thereto (in the case of any such fee letters only, redacted for provisions
related to fees and other economic terms, none of which could materially and
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination
or aggregate principal amount of the Financing).

(c) Except as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Lenders and the Equity Investor to provide
the Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders or the Equity
Investor to reduce the total amount of the Financing. Other than (i) any fee
letter related to the Debt Commitment Letter and (ii) as expressly set forth
in or expressly contemplated by the Commitment Letters, there are no side
letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the funding
or investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Financing.

related fees and expenses required to be paid by Purchaser and Merger Sub in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 

and the Services Agreement and to satisfy all of the other payment obligations
of Purchaser and Merger Sub contemplated hereunder.

(e) As of the date hereof, assuming the satisfaction in full of the conditions
set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2, neither Purchaser nor Merger Sub has reason
to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of the Financing contained in the Commitment Letters.

(f) As of the date of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters are valid,
binding obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, the other parties thereto, and enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, and are in full force and effect, and, assuming the accuracy
of the representations and warranties set forth in Article III such that the
condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) would be satisfied, as of the date
hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the
part of Purchaser or Merger Sub under the terms and conditions of the
Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, no Commitment Letter has been
amended, restated or otherwise modified or waived on or prior to the date of
this Agreement and no such amendment, modification or restatement is
contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment
Letters have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded on or prior to the date
of this Agreement. Purchaser and Merger Sub have paid in full (or caused to be
paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees or expenses required to be
paid pursuant to the terms of the Commitment Letters on or before the date of
this Agreement.

(g) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including the Financing) by Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates
or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any of
Purchaser's or Merger Sub's obligations hereunder.

(h) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Purchaser's and Merger
Sub's obligation to consummate the Merger and the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in Article III and the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(c), and immediately after giving effect to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Separation Agreement and the Services Agreement, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub and, after Closing, the Save-A-Lot
Entities), on a consolidated basis, will be Solvent. For purposes of this
Section 4.6(h), "Solvent" means, with respect to any Person, that:

(i) the fair saleable value (determined on a going concern basis) of the
assets of such Person shall be greater than the total amount of such Person's
liabilities (including all liabilities, whether or not reflected in a balance
sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, and whether direct or indirect, fixed
or contingent, secured or unsecured, disputed or undisputed);

(ii) such Person shall be able to pay its debts and obligations in the
ordinary course of business as they become due; and

(iii) such Person shall have adequate capital to carry on its businesses and
all businesses in which it is about to engage. 

(i) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has delivered
to Supervalu a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Guaranty. As of
the date of this Agreement, the Guaranty is valid, binding and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, and is in full force and effect, and no event has
occurred as of the date hereof that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a
failure to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of the Guarantor under
the terms and conditions of the Guaranty.

4.7 Merger Sub. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose of effecting the
Merger and has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Purchaser has not engaged in any business activities or conducted any
operations other than in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

4.8 Knowledge Regarding Representations; Satisfaction of Conditions;
Independent Investigation. Purchaser has conducted its own independent
investigation, review and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, technology,
management and prospects of the Save-A-Lot Entities and the Business, which

representatives. In entering into this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that
except as expressly provided herein or the Services Agreement, it has relied
solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and analysis and not on
any factual representations or opinions of any of Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot
Entities, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives (except the representations and warranties of Supervalu
expressly set forth in Article III or in the Services Agreement or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(c)). Purchaser hereby
acknowledges that, except with respect to any claim involving Losses resulting
from Fraud, none of Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot Entities, their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives or any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability to Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of
their respective representatives or shareholders or any other Person resulting
from the distribution to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
representatives of, or Purchaser's, its Affiliates' or their respective
representatives' use of, any information relating to Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot
Entities or the Business, including any information, documents or material
made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates or their respective
representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any data room, any
management presentations (formal or informal), functional "break-out"
discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any liability resulting from any claim made pursuant to this Agreement
or the Services Agreement. Purchaser further acknowledges that no
representative of Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot Entities or their respective
Affiliates has any authority, express or implied, to make any representations,
warranties or agreements not specifically set forth in this Agreement or the
Services Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder and subject to
the limited remedies herein provided. Purchaser acknowledges that, subject to
the representations and warranties of Supervalu specifically contained in
Article III or the Services Agreement or in the certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 8.2(c) and the covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
and the Services Agreement, should the Closing occur, Purchaser shall acquire
the Save-A-Lot Entities and the Business without any representation or
warranty as to merchantability or fitness thereof for any particular purpose,
in an "as is" condition and on a "where is" basis, except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement. 

4.9 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article III or the Services Agreement or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(c), Purchaser acknowledges that
none of Supervalu or any other Person or entity on behalf of Supervalu has
made, and Purchaser has not relied upon, any representation or warranty,
whether express or implied, including with respect to Supervalu, the Save-A-
Lot Entities, the Business or their respective businesses, affairs, assets,
liabilities, financial condition, results of operations, future operating or
financial results, estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans or prospects) or with respect to the accuracy or
completeness of any other information provided or made available to Purchaser
by or on behalf of Supervalu. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, subject to
and except as expressly set forth in the representations and warranties
contained in Article III, the Services Agreement or in the certificate
delivered pursuant to Section 8.2(c), that none of Supervalu or any other
Person or entity on behalf of Supervalu has made or makes any representation
or warranty with respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates or budgets
made available to Purchaser of future revenues, future results of operations
(or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition
(or any component thereof) of any of Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot Entities or the
Business, whether or not included in any management presentation.

(a) After the date of this Agreement until the Closing, and subject to the
requirements of applicable Laws, Supervalu shall (I) afford to representatives
of Purchaser and the Debt Financing Source Parties, reasonable access, upon
reasonable request and notice, to the employees, facilities, representatives,
books and records of the Save-A-Lot Entities during normal business hours
consistent with applicable Law and in accordance with the reasonable
procedures established by Supervalu and (II) furnish promptly to Purchaser all
information in its possession or control concerning the Business or the Save-
A-Lot Entities and their respective properties and personnel as may reasonably
be requested by Purchaser; provided, however, (i) none of Supervalu or the
Save-A-Lot Entities shall be required to violate any obligation of
confidentiality to which Supervalu or any Save-A-Lot Entity may be subject in
discharging their obligations pursuant to this Section 5.1(a) and (ii) prior
to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not conduct any sampling of soil,
sediment, surface water, ground water or building material at, on, under or
within any store, facility or warehouse on the Business Owned Real Property or

restrictions of the foregoing clause (i) apply, Supervalu shall provide
Purchaser with a reasonable description of the information not provided and
Supervalu shall cooperate in good faith to design and implement alternative
disclosure arrangements to enable to evaluate any such information, in each
case without resulting in any such violation.

(b) Purchaser agrees that any permitted investigation undertaken by Purchaser
pursuant to the access granted under Section 5.1(a) shall be conducted in such
a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the Business

representatives (in their capacities as such) shall not communicate with any
of the non-management employees of Supervalu and its Affiliates regarding this
Agreement 

or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of
Supervalu, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided that this sentence does not otherwise restrict Supervalu's
obligations under this Section 5.1. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, neither Supervalu nor any Save-A-Lot Entity nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or disclose

access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such
Person or contravene any Laws or obligation of confidentiality; provided that
Supervalu shall provide Purchaser with a reasonable description of the
information not provided and the Parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in

Affiliates to, afford Supervalu and its representatives, during normal
business hours, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access to the books,

5.2 Confidentiality.

(a) The Parties expressly agree that, notwithstanding the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement with respect to termination thereof, the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement are incorporated into this Agreement by
reference and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing;
provided, however, that Purchaser's confidentiality obligations shall
terminate upon the Closing only in respect of the Confidential Information (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent relating to the
Business or the Save-A-Lot Entities. The Parties expressly agree that,
notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to
termination thereof, if, for any reason, the sale of the Units is not
consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of fifteen (15) months following termination of this
Agreement and otherwise in accordance with its terms. The Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby amended to include in the definition of "Representatives"
contained therein all existing or prospective equity investors, co-investors
and debt financing sources of Purchaser and their respective Affiliates and
their respective agents, advisors and representatives. The execution of this
Agreement shall constitute written consent by Supervalu pursuant to the
Confidentiality Agreement to all actions by Purchaser and its Representatives
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement as amended hereby) expressly
contemplated by this Agreement. Onex Partners Manager LP is an express,
intended third party beneficiary of this Section 5.2(a).

(b) For a period of three (3) years following the Closing and, in the case of
information provided to Supervalu pursuant to Section 5.1(c), for a period of

directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants or other advisors, agents or representatives to, treat
as confidential any and all non-public information, knowledge and data about
the Business or the Save-A-Lot Entities and safeguard such information,
knowledge and data by using the same degree of care, but no less than a
reasonable standard of care, to prevent the unauthorized dissemination or
disclosure of such information, knowledge and data as Supervalu used with
respect thereto prior to the execution of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Supervalu or its Affiliates may disclose such information,
knowledge and data (A) to the extent permitted under the Services Agreement,
(B) to the extent required by Law, in any report, statement, testimony or
other submission to any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
Supervalu or its Affiliates, as applicable, or (C) in order to comply with any
Law applicable to Supervalu or its Affiliates, as applicable, or in response
to any request or requirement in the course of any litigation, investigation
or administrative proceeding; provided, further, that, Supervalu shall provide
Purchaser with prompt prior written notice of such requirement or request so
that Purchaser and its Affiliates may seek a protective order or similar
remedy to cause such not to be disclosed. 

5.3 Required Actions.

(a) Prior to Closing, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts (i) to
prepare and file all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to

information required under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws) required
to be obtained or made by Purchaser, Supervalu or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the Merger, and (iii) to execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry
out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each Party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any
applicable Laws to fulfill all conditions precedent to this Agreement and to
not knowingly take any action after the date of this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected to delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining,
any permission, clearance, approval or consent from any such Governmental
Authority necessary to be obtained at or prior to the Closing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and Supervalu shall each keep the others
reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Merger and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
authorizations, Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Merger. In that regard, prior to the Closing,
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.2, each Party shall
promptly consult with the other Party to this Agreement to provide any
necessary information with respect to (and, in the case of correspondence,
provide the other Party (or its counsel) copies of) all filings made by such
Party with any Governmental Authority or any other information supplied by
such Party to, or correspondence with, a Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement and the Merger. Prior to the Closing and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 5.2, (i) each Party to this Agreement
shall promptly inform the other Party to this Agreement, and if in writing,
furnish the other Party with copies of (or, in the case of oral
communications, advise the other Party orally of) any communication from any
Governmental Authority regarding the Merger, and permit the other Party to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other Party in connection with, any proposed written or oral communication or
submission with any such Governmental Authority; (ii) if any Party to this
Agreement or any representative of such Party receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any Governmental Authority
with respect to the Merger, then such Party will make, or cause to be made,
promptly and after consultation with the other Party to this Agreement, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request; (iii) neither Party
shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in connection
with this Agreement or the Merger (or make oral submissions at meetings or in
telephone or other conversations) unless it consults with the other Party in
advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and
(iv) each Party shall furnish the other Party with copies of all
correspondence, filings, submissions and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Authority
with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and furnish the other Party
with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Party
may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary 

filings or submissions of information to any such Governmental Authority.
Purchaser and Supervalu may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other Party
under Section 5.1 as "outside counsel/corporate in-house antitrust counsel
only." Such designated materials and any materials provided by Purchaser to
Supervalu or by Supervalu to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 5.3, and the
information contained therein, shall be given only to the outside legal
counsel and corporate in-house antitrust counsel of the recipient and shall
not be disclosed by such outside counsel and corporate in-house antitrust
counsel to employees (other than corporate in-house antitrust counsel),
officers or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials (Purchaser or Supervalu, as the
case may be) or its legal counsel; it being understood that materials provided
pursuant to this Section 5.3(b) may be redacted (i) to remove references
concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, (iii) as necessary to address reasonable legal
privilege concerns and (iv) to remove references to any information not
related to the Business.

(c) Purchaser and Supervalu shall file, as promptly as practicable, but in any
event no later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
notifications under the HSR Act, and in each case, shall request early
termination of the waiting period, and Purchaser and Supervalu shall file, as
promptly as practicable, any other filings and/or notifications under
applicable Antitrust Laws, but in any event, any initial draft notifications
of any other filings shall be submitted no later than fifteen (15) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement. In the event that the Parties receive a
request for additional information or documentary materials after an initial
notification pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws, the Parties
shall use their respective best efforts to certify compliance with such
requests, as applicable, as promptly as possible and produce documents on a
rolling basis, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such investigatory or review process.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Purchaser's undertaking pursuant to
Section 5.3(a), Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take
all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
any Antitrust Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur at such time as
Purchaser is otherwise required to effect the Closing (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date), including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate Order, or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any businesses, product lines or assets of
the Save-A-Lot Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries, and
(ii) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that after the Closing
Date would limit Purchaser's or its Affiliates' freedom of action with respect
to, or its or their ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets
of the Save-A-Lot Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries. In
that regard Purchaser shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate,
or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of
action with respect to, or Purchaser's, Supervalu's, Save-A-Lot's or their
respective Subsidiaries' ability to retain, any of the businesses, product
lines or assets of the Save-A-Lot Entities or Purchaser. All such efforts by
Purchaser shall be unconditional, and no actions taken pursuant to this
Section 5.3(d) shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a
Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, Supervalu shall not be obligated to take or agree or commit
to take any action (A) that is not conditioned on the Closing or (B) that
relates to any 

business, operations, assets, liabilities, product lines or legal entity not
to be transferred pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

(e) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, Purchaser shall be responsible
for all fees and payments (including filing fees and legal, economist and
other professional fees) to any third party or any Governmental Authority in

5.3, other than the fees of and payments to Supervalu's legal and professional
advisors.

imposed on the receiving entity or its Affiliates with respect to such funds. 

5.10 Use of Marks.

(a) Except as expressly provided in the immediately succeeding paragraph,
neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall use, or have the right to
use, any Supervalu Names, or any name, trademark, service mark or logo that,
in the reasonable judgment of Supervalu, is confusingly similar to any of the
Supervalu Names. Within twenty (20) Business Days of Closing, Purchaser shall
cause each of the Save-A-Lot Entities having a name, trademark, service mark
or logo that include any of the Supervalu Names, to change such name,
trademark, service mark or logo to one that does not include any Supervalu

such change. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and its Affiliates, and
the Save-A-Lot Entities shall have the right to use any Save-A-Lot Names.

the contrary in this Agreement, following the Closing, Purchaser and its
Affiliates may continue to report in textual sentences in a factually accurate
manner on the Business's website, securities filings and other materials that
the Business was acquired from Supervalu. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
be deemed to have violated this Section 5.10, even after the ninety (90) day
period provided above, by reason of: (A) their use of equipment and other
similar articles used in the Business as of the Closing, notwithstanding that
they may bear one or more of the Supervalu Names (provided that it is not
reasonably practicable to remove or cover the Supervalu Names); (ii) the
appearance of the Supervalu Names on any manuals, work sheets, operating
procedures, other written or electronic data, materials or assets (including
computer source code) that are used for internal purposes only in connection

third party's publications, marketing materials, brochures or instruction
sheets that were distributed prior to the Closing and that are not used by
Purchaser and its Affiliates after such ninety (90) day period; or (iv) the
use by Purchaser and its Affiliates of any Supervalu Names in a non-trademark

no longer affiliated with Supervalu or to reference historical details
concerning or make historical reference to the Business.

cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the Financing (or, in
the event any portion or all of the Debt Financing becomes 

unavailable, alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, together
with the remaining Financing, if any, and any other sources available to
Purchaser and Merger Sub, to fund the payment of the Purchase Price and
satisfy any other payment obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub contemplated

reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii)
negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing

Letters (including, if necessary, the flex provisions) and that would not

expected timing of the Marketing Period) the ability of Purchaser and Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger), subject to any amendments or modifications
thereto permitted by the penultimate sentence of this Section 5.11(a), (iii)

forth in Article 8, consummate, and cause each of the Lenders and the Equity
Investor, as applicable, to fund, the Financing at or prior to the Closing.
Purchaser shall keep Supervalu informed on a reasonable basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing.
Purchaser shall give Supervalu prompt written notice upon becoming aware of,
or receiving written notice with respect to, any breach of or default under,
or any event or circumstance that (with or without notice, lapse of time or
both) could reasonably be expected to affect the timely availability of, or
the amount of, the Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Purchaser and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that
neither the availability nor terms of the Financing or any Alternate Financing
are conditions to the obligations of Purchaser and Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger, and Purchaser and Merger Sub reaffirm their obligation to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement subject only to the express conditions set forth in Article VIII,
irrespective and independent of the availability or terms of the Financing or
any Alternate Financing, Purchaser's and Merger Sub's use of efforts in
accordance with this Section 5.11 or otherwise. Purchaser and Merger Sub shall
not, without the prior written consent of Supervalu, amend, modify, supplement
or waive any provision of the Commitment Letters or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing in a manner that would (i) add any additional
condition (or expand any existing condition) to funding of the Financing, (ii)
reduce the amount of Financing, (iii) adversely impact the ability to enforce
any rights thereunder or (iv) reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or otherwise adversely affect the ability of Purchaser and Merger Sub to
obtain the Financing and timely consummate the Merger. For the avoidance of
doubt, it is understood and agreed that Purchaser and Merger Sub, without the
consent of Supervalu or Save-A-Lot, may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to
add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that
have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof and amend
the economic and other arrangements with respect to the existing and
additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Supervalu shall, and shall cause the Save-A-Lot
Entities to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
representatives to, provide all cooperation 

that is necessary, customary or advisable and reasonably requested by
Purchaser to assist Purchaser and Merger Sub in the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, including:

(i) participation in (and use of reasonable best efforts to cause members of
senior management of Save-A-Lot and its external auditors to participate in) a

equivalents) executed in blank) (including providing copies thereof prior to
Closing)), control agreements, other definitive financing documents (including
information necessary for the completion of schedules thereto), borrowing base
certificates or other certificates (including an executed certificate of the

function immediately following the Closing, solely to the extent such person
is a Business Employee that continues to be employed by a Save-A-Lot Entity at
the Closing, with respect to solvency matters relating to the Business (but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, any co-borrower or guarantors of the Debt
Financing other than the Save-A-Lot Entities) as of the Closing in the form
attached to the Debt Commitment Letter) or documents, in each case, as may be
reasonably requested by Purchaser, and (B) to cooperate in connection with

the Debt Financing, including the Financing Information, and identify any such
information, if any, as is suitable for distribution to "public side" lenders; 

(v) use of reasonable best efforts to assist Purchaser in the preparation of
customary pro forma Financial Statements; provided that (A) Purchaser and

(xi) use of reasonable best efforts to take all actions reasonably requested
by Purchaser to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof, to
the extent satisfaction thereof requires the cooperation, and is within the
control, of Supervalu or any Save-A-Lot Entity;

provided, that nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would (w) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of
Supervalu or any of its Subsidiaries, (x) require Supervalu or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Save-A-Lot Entities and then subject in all

otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities, (y) require any of the
Save-A-Lot Entities to agree to pay any commitment or other fees, reimburse
any expenses, provide or enter into any security, any agreements, opinions,

instruments or otherwise incur any liability or give any indemnities that are
effective prior to the Closing, or (z) require Supervalu or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, any organizational document of

Contract; and provided, further, that none of Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot
Entities, their respective Affiliates nor any Persons who are employees,
directors or officers thereof, shall be required to (A) pass resolutions or
consents to approve or authorize the Debt Financing or deliver any legal
opinion or certificates or instruments (other than (i) using reasonable best
efforts to deliver the customary authorization letters referred to in clause
(ii) of this Section 5.11(b) and the solvency certificate referred to in

Financing or (B) prepare pro forma financial information or statements to be
included in any rating agency presentations, bank syndication materials, bank

Financing other than assistance pursuant to Section 5.11(b)(v).

Purchaser and Merger Sub shall promptly, upon request by Supervalu, reimburse
Supervalu for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by Supervalu or any of its Subsidiaries (including
the Save-A-Lot Entities, whose costs and expenses in connection with the
Financing shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, be the sole
responsibility of Purchaser and Merger Sub, provided, however, that Save-A-Lot
shall bear all costs related to its obligations with respect to the
preparation, review, delivery and audit of the historical Financial Statements
referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of the definition of "Financing
Information") or their respective representatives in connection with the
Financing, including the cooperation contemplated in respect of the Debt
Financing by this Section 5.11, and shall indemnify and hold 

harmless Supervalu, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from
and against any and all Liabilities suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in
connection therewith, except in the event such Liabilities arose out of or
resulted from historical financial information of Save-A-Lot provided by or on
behalf of Supervalu in writing specifically for use in connection with the
Debt Financing. Supervalu hereby consents to the reasonable use of logos used
by Save-A-Lot in connection with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage Supervalu or Save-A-Lot or their reputation or goodwill.
Supervalu shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to periodically update any Financing Information provided to Purchaser
as may be necessary so that such Financing Information (i) is Compliant, (ii)
meets the applicable requirements set forth in the definition of "Financing
Information" and (iii) would not, after giving effect to such update(s),
result in the Marketing Period ceasing to be deemed to have commenced. For the
avoidance of doubt, Purchaser may, to most effectively access the financing
markets, require the reasonable cooperation of Supervalu and its Affiliates
under this Section 5.11 at any time, and from time to time and on multiple
occasions, prior to the Closing; provided, that, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Marketing Period shall not be applicable as to each attempt to access the
markets.

(c) For purposes of this Section 5.11, the term "Financing" shall also be
deemed to include any Alternate Financing and the terms "Debt Commitment
Letter," "Equity Commitment Letter" and "Commitment Letters" shall also be
deemed to include any commitment letter in respect of Alternate Financing.

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding either
Party obtained by the other Party pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that
Purchaser and Merger Sub shall be permitted to disclose information as
necessary and consistent with customary practices in connection with the
Financing subject to customary confidentiality arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to Supervalu.

5.12 Pre-Closing Restructuring. Prior to the Closing, Supervalu shall, and

forth therein (the "Pre-Closing Restructuring");

(b) not to, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, amend, modify,
supplement or waive any provision of the Separation Agreement in any manner
adverse to the Save-A-Lot Entities or the Business; and

(c) to cause any Liens on the assets or properties of the Save-A-Lot Entities
securing any indebtedness or other obligations of the Supervalu Group, to be

(a) Effective as of the Closing and except for claims for Fraud or as
otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (including Section 7.2,
Section 7.3, Article X and Section 5.13(b)) or in the Separation Agreement or
the Services Agreement, each of Supervalu, on behalf of itself and each of its
respective Subsidiaries and each of their respective successors and assigns,
on the one hand, and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries, including the Save-A-Lot Entities, and each of their respective

their respective capacities as such), and their respective heirs, executors,
administrators, successors and assigns (such released Persons, the
"Releasees"), in each case from all Indebtedness, demands, Actions, causes of
action, suits, accounts, covenants, contracts, agreements, Losses and other
Liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in law and in equity,
arising out of or related to events, circumstances or actions taken by such
other Party or its respective Subsidiaries (including, in the case of
Supervalu, the Save-A-Lot Entities) occurring or failing to occur, in each
case, at or prior to the Closing Date. Neither Party hereto shall make, and
each Party hereto shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives to make, any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting
any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any
indemnification, against any of the other Party's Affiliates or any of other
Party's Releasees with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to this
Section 5.13. Except as set forth herein, from and after the Closing Date, no
member of the Supervalu Group shall have any right of contribution or
indemnification against any of the Save-A-Lot Entities for any amounts paid to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of any claim for indemnification
under this Agreement or any claim arising from or relating to a breach by
Supervalu or any of the Save-A-Lot Entities or their respective Subsidiaries
of any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement or in the Services Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 5.13(a) shall not constitute a
release from, waiver of, or otherwise apply to the terms of this Agreement,
the Separation Agreement or the Services Agreement or any Liability or
Contract expressly contemplated by this Agreement or the Services Agreement to
be in effect between Supervalu and Purchaser (or their respective Affiliates)
after the Closing, or any enforcement thereof. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.13(b) shall waive,
release or otherwise discharge any Person from any Liability (i) retained,
assumed, transferred, assigned or allocated to Supervalu, on the one hand, or
Purchaser or the Save-A-Lot Entities, on the other hand, in accordance with
this Agreement or the Services Agreement, or (ii) the release of which would
result in the release of any Person other than a Person released pursuant to
Section 5.13(a).

not constitute a breach of this obligation; (B) own, invest in, manage or
operate any person or business engaged in (1) the sale of products for resale

the Save-A-Lot Entities (and Supervalu shall establish reasonable and
customary procedures to prevent the sharing of such information in violation
of the foregoing); provided that, in each case, the foregoing shall not
restrict the Restricted Parties from, directly or indirectly, holding

percent (5%) of the voting power of such Person; provided further that in the
case of the purchase by Supervalu or a Restricted Party of a Person whose
business would otherwise constitute a breach of this Section 5.15(b),
Supervalu or any Restricted Party may purchase such Person without being in
violation of this Section 5.15(b) so long as it shall (1) enter into a binding

outstanding equity interests of Supervalu.

(iii) Nothing in this Section 5.15(b) shall supersede or modify or require
Supervalu or any Restricted Party to breach or fail to comply with any
existing obligations for the sale of, or the provision of logistics or
physical distribution services with respect to, products for resale, to the
extent contained in any Contract to which Supervalu or any Restricted Party is
a party and that is in existence on the date of this Agreement.

(iv) The Parties acknowledge that the restrictions contained in this Section
5.15(b) are reasonable in scope and duration in light of the nature, size and
location of the Business. The Parties further acknowledge that the
restrictions contained in this Section 5.15(b) are necessary to protect
Purchaser's significant investment in the Business, including its goodwill. It
is the desire and intent of the Parties that the provisions of this Section
5.15 be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law. If
all or part of this Section 5.15(b) is held invalid, illegal or incapable of
being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. If any part
of this Section 5.15(b) is held to be excessively broad as to duration, scope,
activity or subject, such part will be construed by limiting and reducing it
so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible under applicable Law
or public policy.

5.16 Member Approvals. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall obtain the written consent of Purchaser (in its capacity as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub) irrevocably approving the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger.

5.17 Service Level Agreements. From and after the date of this Agreement until
the Closing, Supervalu and Purchaser will negotiate in good faith any
additional Services Level Agreements (as defined in the Services Agreement) to
appropriately reflect the service levels provided by Supervalu to Save-A-Lot
during the 12 months preceding the date hereof; provided that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement or the Services Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser and Merger Sub expressly acknowledge and agree that neither the
documentation of nor agreement on any or all such additional Service Level
Agreements are conditions to the obligations of any of the parties hereto to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger
and delivery of the Services Agreement. 

5.18 Shared Contract Obligations. Supervalu and Save-A-Lot agree to take the
actions set forth on Section 5.18 of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules.



5.19 Oracle Agreement Termination. Supervalu and Save-A-Lot agree to use
reasonable best efforts to terminate, in whole or in part (as specified in the
Oracle Notice), all or a portion of the Oracle Agreements (as specified in the
Oracle Notice), in accordance with the terms of such Oracle Agreements,
including by providing Oracle Corporation or its applicable assignee or
affiliate with a written notice of such termination that satisfies the
requirement of the applicable Oracle Agreement(s); provided that Purchaser
delivers to Supervalu a written notice of such request no later than November
17, 2016, specifying the Oracle Agreement(s) to be terminated and if such
termination is in whole or in part (the "Oracle Notice"). Supervalu will be
solely responsible for all costs and expenses related to this Section 5.19.



ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

6.1 Treatment of Business Employees. With respect to each Business Employee,
Purchaser shall provide or cause to be provided, for the period of at least
twelve (12) months immediately following the Closing Date (the "Continuation
Period"), (i) the same wage rate or cash salary level in effect for such
Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) target short-term
incentive compensation opportunities that are no less favorable than the
target short-term incentive compensation opportunities provided to such
Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) other
compensation and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the other compensation and employee benefits provided to such
Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing (excluding long-term
incentives, special or one-time bonuses or retention awards, defined benefit
pension, retiree medical or other retiree welfare benefits and supplemental
retirement and deferred compensation arrangements).

6.2 Service Credit. The Save-A-Lot Benefit Plans established pursuant to
Section 3(b)(i) of the Separation Agreement shall give each Business Employee
full credit for all purposes for such Business Employee's service prior to the
Closing with Supervalu and its applicable Affiliates (including the Save-A-Lot
Entities) and their respective predecessors, to the same extent such service
is recognized by Supervalu and its applicable Affiliates (including the Save-
A-Lot Entities) immediately prior to the Closing. As of and after the Closing,
for purposes of eligibility and vesting and, with respect to vacation, paid
time off and any applicable severance plans, for purposes of determining the
level of benefits thereunder, Purchaser shall or shall cause the applicable
Save-A-Lot Entity to give each Business Employee full credit under each other
employee benefit plan, policy or arrangement, and any other service-based or
seniority-based entitlement maintained or made available for the benefit of
Business Employees as of and after the Closing by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (but excluding equity or equity based compensation arrangements),
for such Business Employee's service prior to the Closing with Supervalu and
its applicable Affiliates (including the Save-A-Lot Entities) and their
respective Predecessors, to the same extent such service is recognized by
Supervalu and its applicable Affiliates (including the Save-A-Lot Entities)
immediately prior to 

the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no service credit will be given to
the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits for the same
period of service.

6.3 Health Coverages. During the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall cause
each Business Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) to be covered by a
group health plan or plans that (a) comply with the provisions of Section 6.1,
(b) do not limit or exclude coverage on the basis of any pre-existing
condition of such Business Employee or dependent (other than any limitation
already in effect under the applicable group health Supervalu Benefit Plan or
Save-A-Lot Benefit Plan) or on the basis of any other exclusion or waiting
period not in effect under the applicable group health Supervalu Benefit Plan
or Save-A-Lot Benefit Plan, and (c) to the extent that such plans are
Purchaser group health plans in which such Business Employee becomes eligible
to participate for the first time following the Closing, provide such Business
Employee full credit, for the plan year in which the Business Employee becomes
eligible to participate in such Purchaser group health plan, for any
deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket expenses already incurred by the
Business Employee under the applicable group health Supervalu Benefit Plan or
Save-A-Lot Benefit Plan during such year for purposes of any deductible, co-
payment or maximum out-of-pocket expense provisions, as applicable, of such
Purchaser group health plans.

6.4 Severance. With respect to each Business Employee whose employment is
terminated without cause during the Continuation Period, Purchaser shall
provide severance pay and benefits equal in value to the severance pay and
benefits as set forth in Section 6.4 of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules,
taking into account the Business Employee's period of employment with
Supervalu and its Affiliates (including any Save-A-Lot Entity) prior to the
Closing and with Purchaser and its Affiliates on and after the Closing.

6.5 WARN and Corresponding State Laws. Purchaser shall be solely responsible
for and agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at the option of Supervalu, to
defend the Supervalu Group from and against any Liabilities under WARN or any
similar state Law, with respect to any Business Employee who is found to have
suffered an "employment loss" under WARN or any similar state Law on or after
the Closing Date as a result of Purchaser's actions, and any and all other
Liabilities under WARN or any similar state Law arising out of or resulting
from Purchaser's actions or Purchaser's failure to serve sufficient notice
pursuant to WARN or any similar state Law.

6.6 Vacation, Holidays and Leaves of Absence. Purchaser shall allow Business
Employees to use the vacation, holiday, annual leave or other leave of absence
assumed or recognized pursuant to Section 3.6(h) of the Separation Agreement,
subject to and in accordance with the terms of Purchaser's or Save-A-Lot's and
its Subsidiaries' vacation, holiday and other leave policies as in effect from
time to time.

6.7 LTD Employees. If any LTD Employee is, within 180 days following the
Closing Date or such longer period required by applicable Law, able to return
to work, Purchaser shall offer employment to such LTD Employee on terms
consistent with those applicable to Business Employees generally under this
Article VI and, from and after such LTD Employee's commencement of employment
with Purchaser, such LTD Employee shall be considered a "Business Employee"
for all purposes under this Agreement. 

6.8 Save-A-Lot Benefit Plans. As of the Closing, Purchaser and its Affiliates
shall assume, or shall cause Save-A-Lot and its Subsidiaries to continue, as
the case may be, sponsorship of, and all Liabilities and other obligations
with respect to, the Save-A-Lot Benefit Plans.

6.9 Treatment of Supervalu Equity Awards.

(a) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Supervalu Common
Stock held by a Business Employee that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Supervalu Stock Option"),
other than Supervalu Retirement-Eligible Stock Options, shall vest as of the
Effective Time with respect to a number of shares of Supervalu Common Stock
underlying such Supervalu Stock Option equal to the product of (i) the number
of shares of Supervalu Common Stock with respect to which such Supervalu Stock
Option would have become vested as of the next vesting date applicable to such
Supervalu Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the Supervalu Equity Award Ratio.
Any portion of such Supervalu Stock Option that is not vested prior to the
Effective Time and that does not become vested in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence shall be forfeited and cancelled for no
consideration as of the Effective Time. Any portion of such Supervalu Stock
Option that is (or becomes) vested as of the Effective Time shall be
exercisable until the earlier of (A) the fourth anniversary of the Closing
Date and (B) the original expiration date of such Supervalu Stock Option.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Supervalu Stock Option that was granted in
2014 and is held by a Business Employee who is retirement-eligible under the
applicable award agreement (each such Supervalu Stock Option, a "Supervalu
Retirement-Eligible Stock Option") shall fully vest as of the Effective Time
and shall continue to be exercisable until the earlier of (A) the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) the original expiration date of such
Supervalu Retirement-Eligible Stock Option.

(c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award in respect of
shares of Supervalu Common Stock held by a Business Employee that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Supervalu RSU
Award"), other than Supervalu Retirement-Eligible RSU Awards and Specified
Supervalu RSU Awards, shall vest as of the Effective Time with respect to a
number of shares of Supervalu Common Stock underlying such Supervalu RSU Award
equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Supervalu Common Stock
with respect to which such Supervalu RSU Award would have become vested as of
the next vesting date applicable to such Supervalu RSU Award multiplied by
(ii) the Supervalu Equity Award Ratio. Any portion of such Supervalu RSU Award
that is not vested prior to the Effective Time and that does not become vested
in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence shall be forfeited and
cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective Time. Supervalu shall
settle the portion of each Supervalu RSU Award that becomes vested in
accordance with the first sentence of this Section 6.9(c) in accordance with
the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(d) At the Effective Time, each Supervalu RSU Award that was granted in 2014
and is held by a Business Employee who is retirement-eligible under the
applicable award agreement (each such Supervalu RSU Award, a "Supervalu
Retirement-Eligible RSU Award") shall fully vest as of the Effective Time and
shall be settled by Supervalu in accordance with the vesting and settlement
schedule set forth in the applicable award agreement. 

(e) At the Effective Time, each Supervalu RSU Award set forth in Section 6.9
of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules (the "Specified Supervalu RSU Awards")
shall be treated as set forth in Section 6.9 of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure
Schedules.

(f) At the Effective Time, each performance stock unit award in respect of
shares of Supervalu Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a Business Employee (each, a "Supervalu PSU Award"
and, together with the Supervalu Stock Options and the Supervalu RSU Awards,
the "Supervalu Equity Awards") shall be forfeited and cancelled for no
consideration.

(g) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Supervalu
and/or its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 6.9 with respect to the Supervalu
Equity Awards.

(h) Supervalu shall be solely responsible for all obligations and Liabilities
for or in respect of the Supervalu Equity Awards, including all applicable Tax
withholding or employment or social or similar Taxes or government mandated
insurance payments required to be made in respect thereof; provided, however,
that in the event Purchaser reasonably determines that a Save-A-Lot Entity (or
any post-Closing Affiliate of a Save-A-Lot Entity) is responsible for any such
Taxes, the Purchaser shall promptly notify Supervalu of such determination
and, to the extent Supervalu has not previously remitted such Taxes to the
applicable Governmental Authority, Supervalu shall, at its election, either
(i) remit such Taxes to the applicable Governmental Authority or (ii) direct
that Purchaser cause the applicable Save-A-Lot Entity to remit the applicable
Taxes to the applicable Governmental Authority, and promptly reimburse all
such Taxes to the Save-A-Lot Entity.

6.10 Savings Plan. With respect to the Save-A-Lot Savings Plan (as defined in
the Separation Agreement), the Purchaser agrees to cause Save-A-Lot or one of
its Affiliates to make contributions to the accounts of active participants
therein for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs in an aggregate amount
not less than the amount included in respect thereof as a Current Liability in
the calculation of Working Capital as reflected in the Final Post-Closing
Statement (or, in the event the Final Post-Closing Statement does not yet
exist as of the time such contributions are to be made, in the Estimated
Closing Statement).

6.11 Third Party Rights. The provisions of this Article VI are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto and nothing herein, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person (including
any Business Employee), other than the parties to this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any legal or equitable or other
rights or remedies under or by reason of any provision of this Article VI.
Nothing contained herein, express or implied: (a) shall be construed to
establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
(including any Benefit Plan); (b) shall alter or limit Supervalu's,
Purchaser's or any Save-A-Lot Entity's ability to amend, modify or terminate
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement (including any Supervalu
Benefit Plan or Save-A-Lot Benefit Plan); or (c) is intended to confer upon
any Business Employee any right to employment or continued employment for any
period of time by reason of this Agreement, or any right to a particular term
or condition of employment. 

ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS

7.1 Section 336(e) Elections or 338(h)(10) Elections; Purchase Price
Allocation.

(a) Supervalu and Purchaser shall (or shall cause their relevant Affiliates
to) jointly make a timely and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of
the Code, or, in lieu thereof, if Purchaser so notifies Supervalu in writing
no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date,
Supervalu shall (and shall cause its relevant Affiliates to) comply with the
requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations Sections 1.336-2(h)(1) and
1.336-2(h)(4) by means of entering into and filing, as necessary, a timely
Section 336(e) Written Binding Agreement, Section 336(e) Election Statement
and IRS Form 8883 (and, (i) any elections corresponding to the election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code under any applicable state or local Tax Law, or
(ii) any state and local requirements corresponding to those of Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.336-2(h)(1) and 1.336-2(h)(4) requested in writing by
Purchaser during the Tax Election Notice Period), with respect to the
acquisition of the Section 336(e)/338(h)(10) Entities pursuant to this
Agreement (any such elections under Section 338, the "Section 338(h)(10)
Elections", and any such elections under Section 336(e), the "Section 336(e)
Elections").

(b) Supervalu and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their relevant Affiliates
to) cooperate in the preparation of all forms, attachments and schedules
necessary to effectuate the Section 336(e) Elections or Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, including, as applicable, IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 and any similar
forms under applicable state and local Income Tax Laws (collectively, the
"Section 336(e)/338(h)(10) Forms") in a manner consistent with the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule and the Allocation (if any). Supervalu and Purchaser
shall (or shall cause their relevant Affiliates to) timely file such Section
336(e)/338(h)(10) Forms with the applicable taxing authorities (in the case of
the Section 336(e) Election for US federal income Tax purposes, by means of
the Section 336(e) Election Statement filed with the consolidated federal
income Tax return for the year that includes the disposition date, and in the
case of any state or local Section 336(e) Elections, by any other form
requested by Purchaser consistent with this Agreement) and take all actions
that are necessary (and, in the case of Supervalu with respect to state or
local Section 336(e) Elections, requested in writing by Purchaser during the
Tax Election Notice Period) to effectuate the Section 336(e) Elections or
Section 338(h)(10) Elections. Supervalu and Purchaser agree that none of them
shall, nor shall any of them permit any of their Affiliates to, revoke the
Section 336(e) Elections or 338(h)(10) Elections following the filing of the
Section 336(e)/338(h)(10) Forms without the prior written consent of Supervalu
or Purchaser, as the case may be. As applicable, Purchaser shall provide
Supervalu with a form of Section 336(e) Written Binding Agreement (for the
absence of doubt, reflecting all relevant details known to Purchaser after due
inquiry) no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date. Between July 15, 2017 and August 15, 2017 (the "Tax Election Notice
Period"), if Purchaser elects to make the Section 336(e) Elections, Purchaser
shall provide Supervalu with the Section 336(e) Election Statement in respect
of each Section 336(e)/338(h)(10) Entity as provided in Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.336-2(h)(5) and with the information required by Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.336-2(h)(6) (for the absence of doubt, in each case,
reflecting all relevant details known to Purchaser after due inquiry). As
applicable, Supervalu shall provide a copy of the Section 336(e) Election
Statements to each Section 336(e)/338 

(h)(10) Entity before filing Supervalu's consolidated federal income Tax
Return for the year that includes the disposition date. "Section 336(e)
Written Binding Agreement" shall mean a written agreement for the members of
the affiliated group of corporations of which Supervalu is the common parent
reflecting a binding obligation to make the Section 336(e) Election for such
members with such agreement to be executed by each applicable member and the
actual or deemed sellers as provided in Treasury Regulations Section
1.336-2(h)(1) and (4), which agreement shall be prepared by Purchaser in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Supervalu. "Section 336(e) Election
Statement" shall mean the "section 336(e) election statement" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.336-2(h)(5), which statement shall
be prepared by Purchaser in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Supervalu, with Supervalu adding to such statement the relevant details of
Supervalu and its Affiliates (including for these purposes the Save-A-Lot
Entities), to the extent not known by Purchaser after due inquiry.
Notwithstanding Section 7.1(a) and 7.1(b), Supervalu and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take all actions that are necessary to
effectuate state or local Section 336(e) Elections. Supervalu hereby informs
Purchaser that its consolidated federal income Tax return for the year
including the disposition date is not due until after August 15, 2017 (taking
into account any extensions).

(c) At Closing, Supervalu and Purchaser shall each deliver to the other Party
one or more duly executed IRS Forms 8023 that reflect the Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such other
Party, or if Purchaser elects to make the Section 336(e) Elections, Supervalu
shall deliver to Purchaser a copy of the Section 336(e) Written Binding
Agreement duly executed by the applicable members specified therein of the
Supervalu affiliated group.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision, for all U.S. federal (and applicable
state and local) Tax purposes, Supervalu and Purchaser agree (and agree to
cause their respective Affiliates) to allocate the Purchase Price (as finally
determined hereunder) and any other amounts treated as consideration for such
Tax purposes, among the assets of the Save-A-Lot Entities deemed sold for U.S.
federal income tax purposes in accordance with Schedule III hereto (the
"Purchase Price Allocation Schedule") (and, for the absence of doubt, subject
to Section 7.1(e), not to treat any portion of the Purchase Price or such
other amounts as a royalty, rent, a fee or compensation or allocable to any
covenant). No later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the Purchase
Price is finally determined hereunder, Supervalu shall deliver to Purchaser a
proposed allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) as of
the Closing Date, which allocation shall incorporate, reflect and be
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, and be determined in a
manner consistent with Sections 336 or 338, as appropriate, and 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder ("Supervalu's Draft
Allocation"). If Purchaser disagrees with Supervalu's Draft Allocation,
Purchaser may, within thirty (30) days after delivery of Supervalu's Draft
Allocation, deliver a notice (the "Purchaser's Allocation Notice") to
Supervalu to such effect, specifying those items as to which Purchaser
disagrees and setting forth Purchaser's proposed allocation of the Purchase
Price (and other relevant amounts), which allocation shall incorporate,
reflect and be consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. If
Purchaser's Allocation Notice is duly delivered, Supervalu and Purchaser
shall, during the twenty (20) days following such delivery, use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in
order to determine the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other relevant
amounts). Insofar as Supervalu and Purchaser are unable to reach such
agreement, each of 

Supervalu and Purchaser may separately determine the allocation of the
Purchase Price (and other relevant amounts) for Tax purposes; provided,
however, that any such allocation shall incorporate, reflect and be consistent
with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. If no Purchaser's Allocation
Notice has been given or if the parties agree to an allocation of the Purchase
Price (and other relevant amounts) pursuant to this Section 7.1(d), then the
relevant allocation, including as adjusted pursuant to any agreement between
Supervalu and Purchaser, if any (collectively, the "Allocation"), shall,
subject to this Section 7.1, be conclusive and binding on all Parties for Tax
purposes. Subject to the proviso set forth in Section 7.1(e), the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule shall be conclusive and binding on all Parties for
Tax purposes. The Allocation shall be adjusted, as necessary, mutually by the
Parties to reflect any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant
to Section 7.9. Any such adjustment shall be allocated to the asset or assets
(if any) to which such adjustment is attributable; provided, that to the
extent there is or are no such asset or assets, such adjustment shall be
allocated pro rata among the assets of the Save-A-Lot Entities deemed sold for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Section
332 Liquidation Treatment" shall mean the treatment of any assets distributed,
directly or indirectly, by the Save-A-Lot Entities to Supervalu pursuant to
the Separation Agreement as having been distributed in the deemed Section 332
liquidation(s) resulting from the Section 336(e) Elections or Section
338(h)(10) Elections.

(e) Supervalu and Purchaser shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) (i)
prepare and file all federal, state, local and foreign Tax Returns (including
the Section 336(e)/338(h)(10) Forms and, if applicable, IRS Form 8594) in a
manner consistent with the Section 336(e) Elections or Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, as applicable, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the Section
332 Liquidation Treatment and, if applicable, the Allocation and (ii) not take
any position inconsistent therewith on any Tax Return, in connection with any
Tax Proceeding or otherwise in respect of Taxes, in each case, except to the
extent otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of applicable state,
local or foreign Law); provided, however, that, in the case of a Tax
Proceeding in which the relevant taxing authority initiates a challenge to the
Section 336(e) Elections or Section 338(h)(10) Elections, the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, the Section 332 Liquidation Treatment or, if applicable,
the Allocation, nothing contained in this Section 7.1 shall prevent the
Parties or their Affiliates from settling any such dispute with a taxing
authority relating to the Section 336(e) Elections or Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the Section 332 Liquidation
Treatment or, if applicable, the Allocation after making a reasonable, good
faith effort to defend the Section 336(e) Elections or Section 338(h)(10)
Elections, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the Section 332 Liquidation
Treatment and, if applicable, the Allocation; and provided, further, for the
avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
Supervalu or Purchaser or their Affiliates from taking an inconsistent
position with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule or, if applicable, the
Allocation, for financial accounting purposes. 

7.2 Tax Indemnification by Supervalu. Effective as of and after the Closing
Date, Supervalu shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify the
Purchaser, and each of its Subsidiaries, (including the Save-A-Lot Entities
after the Closing Date), their respective Affiliates (other than any Person
that is an Affiliate solely by reason of common control), successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties") and
hold each Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against (a) any
consolidated, combined or unitary Income Taxes of Supervalu or another member
of the Supervalu Group; (b) any Taxes resulting from any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Supervalu contained in this Agreement or the
Separation Agreement; (c) any Taxes for which the Save-A-Lot Entities are
liable (including, for the absence of doubt, as a transferee or successor) for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period and any Taxes imposed on or with respect to the
Save-A-Lot Assets (as defined in the Separation Agreement) for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period; (d) any Taxes for which Supervalu is responsible under Section
7.11; (e) any Taxes of any Person (other than the Save-A-Lot Entities) for
which any Save-A-Lot Entity is liable pursuant to a Tax sharing agreement the
primary subject of which is Taxes (for the absence of doubt, other than
commercial, business or financial leases, licenses, purchase agreements,
partnership or joint venture agreements, employment or compensation
agreements, Benefit Plans, swaps, hedges, Save-A-Lot Individual Agreements (as
defined in the Separation Agreement), types of contracts described in the
definition of Indebtedness or Section 3.15, and Business Material Contracts,
and other than this Agreement, the Separation Agreement, and the Services
Agreement) which contract was entered into by a Save-A-Lot Entity, Supervalu,
or any of their Affiliates before the Closing; (f) any Taxes imposed on the
Pre-Closing Restructuring steps set forth in Schedule 2.1(a) of the Separation
Agreement (including for these purposes as part of the Pre-Closing
Restructuring any such step completed through a delayed transfer contemplated
by Section 2.4 (such step, a "Delayed Transfer") of the Separation Agreement)
(but not including under this clause (f), for the absence of doubt, any Taxes
for any Post-Closing Tax Period imposed as a consequence of the structure in
place as a result of the Pre-Closing Restructuring, any Taxes for any Post-
Closing Tax Period imposed on any action or transaction, or failure to act or
transact, at or after the Closing (other than any Delayed Transfer), nor any
Tax relating to the ownership of, or relating to or arising from the use or
Tax basis of any Save-A-Lot Assets (as defined in the Separation Agreement) at
or after the Closing nor any Taxes reported by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates on a Return for the Post-Closing Tax Period unless there is no
reasonable basis not to report such Taxes on such Return); and (g) any costs
and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to
any Tax for which Supervalu is responsible pursuant to this Section 7.2;
provided, however, that Supervalu shall not be required to pay or cause to be
paid, or to indemnify or hold harmless the Purchaser Tax Indemnified Parties
from and against (i) any Taxes to the extent Supervalu can establish that such
Taxes were reflected as a reserve or liability in Working Capital or
Indebtedness on the Final Post-Closing Statement reduced (but not below zero)
by the amount of any payments in respect of such Tax made pursuant to Section
7.5(d), (ii) except in the case of Section 7.2(b), any Taxes for which
Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 7.3(a), (b), (c) or (e), (iii) in
the case of Section 7.2(c) above, Taxes arising in the ordinary course of
business on the Closing Date (or, with respect to (i), (ii) or (iii), any
costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable
thereto) or (iv) any costs or expenses incurred by Purchaser in exercising its
rights pursuant to Section 7.6(b), or any costs and expenses incurred by
Purchaser or its Affiliates that were paid to Supervalu to prepare Tax Returns
for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 7.4, pursuant to the
terms of the Services Agreement. 

7.3 Tax Indemnification by Purchaser. Effective as of and after the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, and shall indemnify each member
of the Supervalu Group, their respective Affiliates (other than any Person
that is an Affiliate by reason of common control), successors and permitted
assigns (collectively, the "Seller Tax Indemnified Parties") and hold each
Seller Tax Indemnified Party harmless from and against i) any Taxes resulting
from any action or transaction by Purchaser, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
the Save-A-Lot Entities outside of the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after the Closing; ii) any Taxes resulting from any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Purchaser contained in this Agreement or any breach
of any covenant or agreement, occurring on or after the Closing Date, of Save-
A-Lot contained in the Separation Agreement; iii) any Taxes for which
Purchaser is responsible under Section 7.11; iv) any Taxes for which the Save-
A-Lot Entities are liable (including, for the absence of doubt, as a
transferee or successor) for any Post-Closing Tax Period and any Taxes imposed
on or with respect to the Save-A-Lot Assets (as defined in the Separation
Agreement) for the Post-Closing Tax Period; (e) any Taxes described in or
covered by any of clauses (i) or (iii) of the proviso contained in Section
7.2; and (f) any costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses, attributable to any Tax for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant
to Section 7.3; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not be required to pay
or cause to be paid, or to indemnify or hold harmless the Seller Tax
Indemnified Parties from and against (i) except in the case of Section 7.3(a)
and (b), any Taxes for which Supervalu is responsible pursuant to Section
7.2(b) and (ii) in the case of Section 7.3(d), any Taxes for which Supervalu
is responsible pursuant to Section 7.2(a), (d), (e) or (f) (or, with respect
to (i) or (ii), any costs and expenses, including reasonable legal fees and
expenses attributable thereto).

7.4 Tax Returns.

(a) Supervalu shall timely prepare and file or shall cause to be timely
prepared and filed in such manner as Supervalu shall determine (i) in its sole
discretion, any combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return that includes any
member of the Supervalu Group, on the one hand, and any of the Save-A-Lot
Entities, on the other hand (a "Combined Tax Return") and any other Tax Return
of or that includes any member of the Supervalu Group, and (ii) consistent
with Law, any Tax Return (other than any Tax Return described in clause (i)
above) that is required to be filed by or with respect to any of the Save-A-
Lot Entities that is due (including extensions) on or before the Closing Date.
For the absence of doubt, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Supervalu and any of its Affiliates may adopt the method of
accounting described in Treasury Revenue Procedure 2015-56 (and any cost
segregation and depreciation method changes pursuant to Treasury Revenue
Procedures 2015-13 and 2016-29), which may apply to the Save-A-Lot Entities,
Supervalu shall be entitled to retain any Tax Benefit resulting from such
action and Supervalu shall not be required to make any payment to the
Purchaser or any Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party resulting from such action.

(b) Purchaser shall not amend or revoke any Tax Return (or any notification or
election relating thereto) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of Supervalu, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) Except for any Tax Return described in Section 7.4(a), Purchaser shall
prepare and timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax
Returns with respect to the Save-A-Lot Entities for the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and any Straddle Period. In the case of any such Tax 

Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period, Purchaser shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and timely file such Tax Return in a manner
consistent with past practices, elections and methods of the Save-A-Lot
Entities (or of Supervalu with respect to the Save-A-Lot Entities or the Save-
A-Lot Assets, as defined in the Separation Agreement), except as otherwise
required by Law. Purchaser shall deliver to Supervalu for its review, comment
and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) a copy of such Tax Returns at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
due date thereof (taking into account any extensions). Purchaser shall revise
such Tax Returns to reflect any reasonable comments received from Supervalu
not later than the later of five (5) days before the due date thereof (taking
into account extensions) and ten (10) days following the date such Tax Returns
are formally delivered to Supervalu by the Purchaser. Purchaser shall not
amend or revoke any such Tax Returns (or any notification or election relating
thereto) without the prior written consent of Supervalu, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. At Supervalu's reasonable
request and consistent with Law, Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed,
amended Tax Returns (for the absence of doubt, other than any Tax Returns
described in Section 7.4(a)(i)) for Pre-Closing Tax Periods or Straddle
Periods with respect to the Save-A-Lot Entities or Save-A-Lot Assets (as
defined in the Separation Agreement) to obtain a cash Tax refund (or credit in
lieu of a cash Tax refund) or other Tax Benefit that Supervalu is entitled to
pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement or the Services Agreement, Supervalu shall not be required to
provide any Person with any Tax Return or copy of any Tax Return (i) of
Supervalu or a member of the Supervalu Group, (ii) of a consolidated, combined
or unitary group that includes any member of the Supervalu Group or (iii) that
is a Combined Tax Return or copy of a Combined Tax Return.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, regarding Taxes and Tax Items relating to
a Straddle Period, the portion of any Tax (or, except in the case of property
Taxes, Tax Item) that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be: (i)
in the case of property Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though
the taxable year of the relevant entity terminated at the close of business on
the Closing Date.

7.5 Certain Tax Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks.

(a) Supervalu shall be entitled to any Tax Benefit arising from any Tax Item
arising in respect of any liabilities or reserves included in the
determination of Working Capital or Indebtedness on the Final Post-Closing
Statement or arising in respect of any compensation for services (or payroll
or similar Taxes) paid (in cash, Supervalu Equity Awards, Supervalu Common
Stock or otherwise) by Supervalu, net of (i) any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Purchaser or its Affiliates in obtaining such Tax Benefit and (ii)
any Taxes paid or required to be paid by Purchaser or its Affiliates with
respect to such Tax Benefit; provided, however, that Supervalu shall not be
entitled to any Tax Benefit pursuant to this Section 7.5(a) that Purchaser can
establish was itself included in the calculation of Working Capital on the
Final Post-Closing Statement except to the extent of any payments in respect
of such Tax Benefit made pursuant to Section 7.5(d). Purchaser 

acknowledges and agrees that neither Purchaser nor any Purchaser Tax
Indemnified Party shall claim any such Tax Item on any Tax Return; provided,
however, that if any such Tax Item is not permitted by Law to be claimed on a
Tax Return described in Section 7.4(a), then Purchaser shall, or shall cause
its relevant Affiliates to, claim, to the extent legally able to claim, such
Tax Item and Tax Benefit and pay to Supervalu the amount of any Tax Benefit
resulting from such Tax Item to which Supervalu is entitled pursuant to this
Section 7.5(a) within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt or realization
of such Tax Benefit.

(b) Supervalu shall be entitled to any cash refunds of or against any Taxes
(i) that were paid or funded prior to the Closing by Supervalu, any Save-A-Lot
Entity or any of their Affiliates, (ii) that were paid or funded (or
reimbursed to a Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party) pursuant to or in accordance
with Section 7.2 by Supervalu or its Affiliates, (iii) that were reflected as
a liability or reserve in Working Capital or Indebtedness on the Final Post-
Closing Statement (reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any payments
in respect of such liability made pursuant to Section 7.5(d)), (iv) of any
member of the Supervalu Group or reported on a Combined Tax Return and paid by
Supervalu or its Affiliates or (v) that would result from the carryforward or
carryback of any Tax Item arising in a Pre-Closing Tax Period of any Save-A-
Lot Entity to another Pre-Closing Tax Period (and, in each case, any credits
received in lieu of such a refund); provided, however, that Supervalu shall
not be entitled to any refunds to the extent Purchaser can establish that such
refunds were reflected as an asset in Working Capital on the Final Post-
Closing Statement reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any payments
in respect of such refund made pursuant to Section 7.5(d). Purchaser shall be
entitled to any cash refunds (or credits in lieu thereof) of the Save-A-Lot
Entities of or against any Taxes for the Post-Closing Tax Period other than
refunds or credits to which Supervalu is entitled pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, Section 7.5(a), Section 7.5(d) or Section 10.6. Each Party shall
pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to the Party entitled to a refund or
credit of Taxes under this Section 7.5(b), the amount of such refund or credit
(including any interest paid thereon and net of any Taxes or other out-of-
pocket costs to the Party receiving such refund or credit in respect of the
receipt or accrual of such refund or credit) in readily available funds within
fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of the refund or credit or the
application of such refund or credit against amounts otherwise payable. To the
extent any refund or credit paid to a Party pursuant to this Section 7.5(b) is
subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the applicable
Governmental Authority, such Party agrees promptly to repay the amount of such
refund or credit, together with any interest, penalties or other additional
amounts imposed by such Governmental Authority, to the other Party (or the
Governmental Authority, as applicable).

(c) Purchaser shall not, and shall procure that its Affiliates do not, carry
back any item of loss, deduction or credit which arises in any taxable period
beginning after the Closing Date into any taxable period beginning on or
before the Closing Date.

(d) On the two (2)-year anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
provide to Supervalu a schedule setting forth a reconciliation of (i) the
amounts included in respect of Tax assets, on the one hand, and Tax
liabilities and reserves, on the other hand, in the determination of the
amount of Working Capital or Indebtedness set forth in the Final Post-Closing
Statement and (ii) the actual Tax assets, on the one hand, and Tax liabilities
and reserves, on the other hand, realized or incurred, respectively, from or
to a Governmental Authority within such two (2)-year period (or that will be
realized or incurred within the thirty (30) days following such second
anniversary (in the case 

of a Tax liability or reserve, pursuant to a written settlement agreement
reached prior to such second anniversary)) by Purchaser or its Affiliates or
any Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party (including, after the Closing, the Save-A-
Lot Entities) in respect of the assets, on the one hand, and liabilities and
reserves, on the other hand, respectively, described in clause (i). Supervalu
shall promptly after such second anniversary pay to Purchaser the amount, if
any, of the excess of the amount of assets described in clause (i) over the
corresponding amount described in clause (ii) and Purchaser shall promptly
after such second anniversary pay to Supervalu, as applicable, the amount, if
any, of the excess of the amount of liabilities and reserves described in
clause (i) over the corresponding amount described in clause (ii). Any dispute
regarding the schedule required to be prepared by Purchaser or the amount
payable, if any, by Supervalu or Purchaser pursuant to this Section 7.5(d)
shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Supervalu, on the
one hand, and Purchaser, on the other hand.



7.6 Tax Contests.

(a) If any taxing authority asserts a Tax Claim, then the Party to this
Agreement first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly shall provide
written notice thereof to the other Party to this Agreement; provided,
however, that the failure of such Party to give such prompt notice shall not
relieve the other Party of any of its obligations under this Article VII,
except to the extent that the other Party is actually prejudiced by such
failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax
Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence
received from the taxing authority.

(b)

(i) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the Save-A-
Lot Entities or the Save-A-Lot Assets (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period), Supervalu shall
have the exclusive right to control such Tax Proceeding in all respects;
provided, however, that (except in the case of a Tax Proceeding described in
Section 7.6(d)) if the resolution of any such Tax Proceeding would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse impact on Purchaser and its Affiliates,
then (A) Supervalu shall consult with Purchaser before taking any significant
action in connection with such Tax Proceeding and shall provide Purchaser with
a timely and reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding
and (B) to the extent the resolution of such Tax Proceeding would bind
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates for a Post-Closing Tax Period or would
result in a material Tax liability of a Save-A-Lot Entity for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period for which Purchaser is responsible pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or
7.3(b) or as a result of the last proviso in Section 10.2), then Supervalu
shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such Tax Proceeding without
obtaining the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (provided that any costs or
expenses incurred by Purchaser in exercising its rights pursuant to clauses
(A) or (B) above shall be paid by Purchaser without reimbursement from
Supervalu, notwithstanding Section 7.2). 

(ii) In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with respect to any of the Save-A-
Lot Entities or the Save-A-Lot Assets (as defined in the Separation Agreement)
for a Post-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle Period), Purchaser shall
have the exclusive right to control such Tax Proceeding in all respects;
provided, however, that if the resolution of any such Tax Proceeding would
reasonably be expected to result in a material indemnity obligation of
Supervalu pursuant to Section 7.2, then (A) Purchaser shall consult with
Supervalu before taking any significant action in such Tax Proceeding in
connection with the tax issue(s) that could give rise to an indemnity
obligation of Supervalu and shall provide Supervalu with a timely and
reasonably detailed account of each phase of such Tax Proceeding relevant to
such issue(s), and (B) to the extent the resolution of such issue(s) in such
Tax Proceeding would result in an indemnity obligation for Supervalu under
Section 7.2, then Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or abandon any such
Tax Proceeding with respect to such issue(s) without obtaining the prior
written consent of Supervalu, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the case of a Tax Proceeding of or with
respect to a Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party (other than Purchaser or the
Save-A-Lot Entities or their successors or permitted assigns) involving Taxes
for which Supervalu would reasonably be expected to be responsible pursuant to
Section 7.2, Purchaser shall, and shall procure that any Purchaser Tax
Indemnified Party conducting such Tax Proceeding, conduct and defend such Tax
Proceeding diligently and in good faith as if such Taxes were not subject to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement and were the only Taxes at issue in
such Tax Proceeding.

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to control any Tax Proceeding of or with
respect to any of the Save-A-Lot Entities for any Straddle Period (other than
a Tax Proceeding described in Section 7.6(d)); provided, however, that if any
such Tax Proceeding could have an adverse impact on Supervalu or any of its
Affiliates (including as a result of any indemnity pursuant to this
Agreement), then (i) Purchaser shall consult with Supervalu before taking any
significant action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (ii) Purchaser
shall consult with Supervalu and offer Supervalu an opportunity to comment
before submitting any written materials prepared or furnished in connection
with such Tax Proceeding, and (iii) Purchaser shall not settle, compromise or
abandon any such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of
Supervalu, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Separation
Agreement or the Services Agreement, Supervalu shall have the exclusive right
to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates
shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with respect to (i)
any Tax Return of Supervalu or a member of the Supervalu Group; (ii) any Tax
Return of a consolidated, combined or unitary group that includes any member
of the Supervalu Group; and (iii) any Combined Tax Return; provided that, if
the resolution of any such Tax Proceeding would reasonably be expected
adversely to impact Purchaser, any Save-A-Lot Entity or any of their
respective Affiliates in any Post-Closing Tax Period, Supervalu shall provide
written notice of such Tax Proceeding to Purchaser and promptly shall respond
to any reasonable requests from Purchaser inquiring as to the status of such
Tax Proceeding. 

7.7 Cooperation and Exchange of Information.

(a) Each Party to this Agreement shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide to the other Party to this Agreement such cooperation, documentation
and information as either of them reasonably may request with respect to Tax
matters, including in connection with (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes or an
indemnity or other obligation under this Article VII or a right to refund of
Taxes or to a Tax Benefit or credit or (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing necessary powers of
attorney, copies of all relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together
with all relevant portions of relevant accompanying schedules and relevant
work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings or other determinations by
taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax basis
of property and other information, which any such Party may possess. Each
Party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually convenient
basis at its cost to provide an explanation of any documents or information so
provided.

(b) Each Party shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, and
all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters, of the
relevant entities for their respective Tax periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date until the later of (x) the expiration of the statute of
limitations for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents
relate, or (y) eight (8) years following the due date (without extension) for
such Tax Returns.

7.8 Tax Sharing Agreements. On or before the Closing Date, the rights of the
Save-A-Lot Entities against the members of the Supervalu Group and the
obligations of the Save-A-Lot Entities to the members of the Supervalu Group
pursuant to all Tax sharing agreements or arrangements (other than this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement and the Services Agreement), if any, to
which any of the Save-A-Lot Entities, on the one hand, and any member of the
Supervalu Group, on the other hand, are parties, shall terminate, and neither
any member of the Supervalu Group, on the one hand, nor any of the Save-A-Lot
Entities, on the other hand, shall have any rights against or obligations to
each other after the Closing in respect of such agreements or arrangements.

7.9 Tax Treatment of Payments. Except to the extent otherwise required by Law,
Supervalu, Purchaser, the Save-A-Lot Entities and their respective Affiliates
shall treat any and all payments under Article IV of the Separation Agreement
or under Section 2.11, this Article VII or Article X of this Agreement as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price or as a payment of an assumed or retained
liability for Tax purposes.

7.10 Certain Tax Elections. Purchaser shall not make, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Save-A-Lot Entities) not to make, any election with
respect to any Save-A-Lot Entity (including any entity classification election
pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3), which election would be
effective on or prior to the Closing Date or could affect any transaction
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. 

7.11 Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Separation Agreement or the Services Agreement, Purchaser shall
pay, when due, and be responsible for (and reimburse Supervalu and its
Affiliates for any such Taxes, fees and costs previously paid by them), any
sales, use, transfer, real property transfer, registration, documentary,
stamp, value added or similar Taxes and related fees and costs ("Transfer
Taxes") imposed on the Merger or the sale of the Units pursuant thereto;
provided that Supervalu will be responsible for any Transfer Taxes imposed on
(and reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates for any such Taxes, fees and costs
previously paid by them) the Pre-Closing Restructuring steps set forth in
Schedule 2.1(a) to the Separation Agreement (including for these purposes any
Transfer Taxes imposed on a Delayed Transfer). The Party responsible under
applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes
shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of
such Tax Return to the other Party. Supervalu and Purchaser shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any
Tax Returns or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any
claim for exemption or exclusion from the application or imposition of any
Transfer Taxes.

7.12 Timing of Payments. Any indemnity payment required to be made to the
other Party pursuant to this Article VII shall be made within ten (10) days
after the indemnified Party makes written demand upon the indemnifying Party,
but in no case earlier than two (2) days prior to the date on which the
relevant Taxes or other amounts are required to be paid to the applicable
taxing authority.

7.13 Tax Matters Coordination(c) . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, indemnification with respect to Taxes and the procedures
relating thereto shall be governed exclusively by this Article VII, Section
10.1(a), Section 10.1(c), the final proviso in Section 10.2, the final proviso
in Section 10.3, Section 10.5, Section 10.6, Section 10.7, Section 10.8 and

Section 10.3, Section 10.5, Section 10.6, Section 10.7, Section 10.8 and
Section 10.9) shall not apply. The indemnification obligations contained in
this Article VII shall survive the Closing Date until the expiration of the
applicable statutory periods of limitation plus ninety (90) days. No Person
seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article VII shall be entitled to
assert any indemnification claim after the expiration of the applicable
survival period referenced in this Section 7.13; provided, however, that if,
prior to such expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of claim
shall have been given to the Person from whom indemnification is sought in
accordance with this Article VII, the Person seeking indemnification shall
continue to have the right to assert such indemnification until such claim for
indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this
Article VII.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Supervalu and Purchaser;

(b) by either Supervalu or by Purchaser, if:

(i) the Closing shall not have occurred on or before 11:59 p.m., New York
time, on February 16, 2017 (the "Outside Date"); provided, however, that if
all of the conditions to the Closing, other than the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) (to the extent that such Legal Restraint is
in respect of a consent, authorization or approval required under Section
8.1(a)), shall have been satisfied or waived or shall be capable of being
satisfied on such date, or the Marketing Period has not yet been completed,
the Outside Date may be extended by either Party from time to time on the
Outside Date, the latest of any of which dates shall thereafter be deemed to
be the Outside Date; provided, however, that in no event shall the Outside
Date be extended past April 16, 2017; provided, further, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this clause (i) shall not be available to any
Party to this Agreement whose failure to perform any material covenant or
obligation 

under this Agreement has been the cause of, or has resulted in, the failure of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or before such
date;

(ii) any Legal Restraint permanently preventing or prohibiting consummation of
the Merger shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;

with respect to any such Legal Restraint; or

(iii) any Governmental Authority that must grant a consent, authorization or

after receipt of written confirmation from Supervalu that all conditions set
forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 have been satisfied or that it is waiving any
unsatisfied conditions in Sections 8.1 and 8.2 and that Supervalu is ready,
willing and able to consummate the Closing, Purchaser fails to consummate the
Closing by the date that Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.3;

(ii) Purchaser shall have breached in any material respect any of its

(B) (1) is incapable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (2) has not
been cured prior to the date that is thirty (30) days from the date that
Purchaser is notified in writing by Supervalu of such breach; provided that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c)(ii)
shall not be available to Supervalu if Supervalu is then in breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would result in the failure of the conditions set

(iii) Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and
such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.3(b), and (B) (1) is incapable of being cured
prior to the Outside Date or (2) has not been cured prior to the date that is
thirty (30) days from the date that Purchaser is notified in writing by

warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach
would result in the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or
8.2(b) to be satisfied. 

(iv) if the written consent of Purchaser (in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub) irrevocably approving the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, shall not
have been delivered to Merger Sub, with a copy concurrently to Supervalu,
within twenty-four (24) hours of the execution of this Agreement.

(d) by Purchaser, if:

(i) Supervalu shall have breached in any material respect any of its
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, and such breach (A)
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.2(a), and

9.2 Notice of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Supervalu and Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1, written
notice of such termination shall be given by the terminating Party to the
other.

9.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either or both of Supervalu and Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.1, this
Agreement shall terminate and become void and have no effect, and there shall
be no liability on the part of any Party to this Agreement or their respective
Affiliates or any other Purchaser Related Parties or Supervalu Related
Parties, except as set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that
(a) nothing in this Agreement shall relieve Supervalu or Save-A-Lot from
liability for any Fraud or intentional breach of this Agreement or intentional
failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement and (b) subject to
Section 9.4(d) (including the limitation on liability set forth therein) in
the case of Purchaser, the termination of this Agreement under circumstances
in which the Reverse Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to Section 9.4(a)
shall not relieve Purchaser for liability for any willful and intentional
breach of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the provisions of Section 5.2(a) (Confidentiality), the second
sentence of Section 5.3(e) (Required Actions), Section 9.4 (Reverse
Termination Fee), Article XI (General Provisions) and this Section 9.3 shall
survive any termination of this Agreement, and nothing in this Agreement shall
relieve either Party hereto 

from liability for failure to perform the obligations thereunder. For purposes
of this Agreement, "willful and intentional breach" shall mean a deliberate
act or a deliberate failure to act, which act or deliberate failure to act was
undertaken with the intent or knowledge (actual or constructive) that such act
or failure to act would be, or would reasonably be expected to cause, a
material breach of this Agreement.

9.4 Reverse Termination Fee.

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by Supervalu pursuant to Section
9.1(c)(i), or 9.1(c)(ii) or 9.1(c)(iii) (each a "Specified Termination"), then
Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to an
account or accounts designated by Supervalu, within two (2) Business Days
after the date on which this Agreement is so terminated, an amount in cash
equal to $88,725,000 (the "Reverse Termination Fee").

(b) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.4
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the other Party would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Purchaser fails promptly to pay the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 9.4, and, in order to obtain such payments, Supervalu
commences a suit that results in a judgment against Purchaser for the amounts
set forth in this Section 9.4, Purchaser will pay to Supervalu, from the date
such payment was required to be made, the Interest Rate on the amounts set
forth in this Section 9.4 and Supervalu's reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with such suit.

(c) Supervalu agrees that in the event that (i) Supervalu effects a Specified
Termination and (ii) Supervalu receives full payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee, the remedy provided for in Section 9.4(a) shall thereafter be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Supervalu against the Purchaser Related
Parties for any Losses suffered or Liabilities incurred as a result of the
failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform
hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Purchaser
Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Guaranty. For the
avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not limit the rights of
Supervalu under Section 11.11 prior to the satisfaction of the conditions in
clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence.

(d) In connection with any Loss suffered as a result of any willful and
intentional breach of this Agreement by Purchaser, other than in a
circumstance in which Supervalu is entitled to receive the Reverse Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 9.4(a), Supervalu agrees that the maximum aggregate
Liability of Purchaser shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of
the Reverse Termination Fee, and in no event shall Supervalu be entitled to
seek or obtain any recovery or judgment in excess of such amount; provided
that nothing in this Section 9.4(d) shall limit any rights of Supervalu or its
Affiliates under Article X after the Closing (other than with respect to any
such breach with respect to Section 5.11 or Purchaser's or Merger Sub's
obligation to consummate the Closing) or under Section 11.11 prior to the
termination of this Agreement; provided, further, that in no event shall
Supervalu or its Affiliates be entitled to both specific performance under
Section 11.11 and recovery of Losses pursuant to this Section 9.4(d). 

(e) In no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee
on more than one occasion. In the event the Reverse Termination Fee is payable
pursuant to this Section 9.4, the receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee,
together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 9.4(b), if any, shall,
subject to Section 9.4(c), be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
Losses suffered or Liabilities incurred by Supervalu or any other person in
connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the Guaranty (and
the termination thereof), the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
(and the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and upon payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, neither
Supervalu nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any
claim or Action against Purchaser or the Purchaser Related Parties arising out
of or in connection with this Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the
Guaranty, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination.

9.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, either Supervalu, on
the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other contained
in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions of the other
contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party granting such
extension or waiver.

expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of claim shall have

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article X and except with respect to

inaccuracy in any such representation or warranty, for the purpose of
determining the amount of any Losses actually incurred or suffered by any of

(arising from related facts or circumstances) that exceeds $1,000,000, subject
to the other limitations set forth in this Article X); (C) except for Losses

10.4 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
"Indemnified Party") shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10) Business
Days) notify the Party or Parties liable for such indemnification (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand
asserted by a third party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given
or would reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification
under such agreement (such claim being a "Third Party Claim"); provided, that
the failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this Article X except if and to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being
agreed that any such notice must describe in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand and
the section purportedly breached and must be delivered prior to the expiration
of any applicable survival period specified in Section 10.1 for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, as applicable.

(b) Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity from an
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.3(a), the
Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the Indemnified Party
delivered within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such
Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such Third Party Claim
(at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); provided that the Indemnifying
Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with the Indemnified
Party's own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not
assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Section 10.2(b), the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control
such defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to select counsel, contractors
and consultants of recognized standing and competence reasonably acceptable to
the Indemnified Party and shall use commercially reasonable efforts in the
defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim. Purchaser or Supervalu, as
the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates and
representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the
defense of any Third Party Claim, including by furnishing non-privileged books
and records, personnel and witnesses, as appropriate for any defense of such
Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's sole cost and expense. The
Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any Third Party 

Claim, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement
or judgment does not (x) involve any injunctive relief or finding or admission
of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified
Party or (y) result in any Losses to the Indemnified Party in excess of the
Cap; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be
paid all amounts in such settlement or judgment (subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 10.2(b) and Section 10.3(b)). No Indemnified Party will
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or
compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

10.5 Exclusive Remedy and Release. Except with respect to (i) the Services
Agreement, (ii) the Separation Agreement, (iii) the matters covered by
Sections 2.9 through 2.11, and (iv) the right to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and the Services Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof and thereof as provided for and subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 11.11, Purchaser and Supervalu acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Sections 7.2,
7.3, 10.2 and 10.3 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Supervalu,
Purchaser and their respective Affiliates for any Losses (including any Losses
from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise but excluding claims for Fraud) that each Party may at
any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including any breach of any representation or warranty in this Agreement by
any Party, or any failure by any Party to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with,
under this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchaser hereby irrevocably waives any right of rescission it may otherwise
have or to which it may become entitled.

10.6 Additional Indemnification Provisions. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses shall be
net of (i) any third-party, representation and warranty or other insurance and
indemnity proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party in connection
with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification, less the amount of
out-of-pocket costs incurred to collect such proceeds (it being agreed that if
third-party insurance or indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are
recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's
making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable
indemnification obligation, such proceeds less the amount of out-of-pocket
costs incurred to collect such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the
Indemnifying Party); and (ii) any Tax Benefit to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates arising directly from such Loss that is actually realized with
respect to the taxable year to which such Loss relates or any of the three (3)
succeeding taxable years (the "Benefit Taxable Years") (net of any out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in the
Benefit Taxable Years with respect to such Tax Benefit and Taxes with respect
to such Tax Benefit actually paid by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
with respect to the Benefit Taxable Years, it being agreed and understood that
the only loss of deductions resulting from the loss of basis resulting from
the receipt of the indemnity payment that shall be taken into account in
calculating such Taxes shall be a loss of deductions for the Benefit Taxable
Years resulting from a loss of Tax basis as a direct result of the receipt of
the indemnity payment). The Indemnified Party shall, or shall cause its
relevant Affiliates to, claim, to the extent legally able to claim, any Tax 

Benefit arising directly from the relevant Loss (a) to which the Indemnifying
Party is entitled, or (b) which would reduce a Loss, under this Section 10.6.
Any Tax Benefit described in clause (ii) above that is actually realized with
respect to the Benefit Taxable Years after the relevant indemnification
payment has been made, or otherwise not taken into account in the relevant
indemnification payment, shall be paid over by the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates within fifteen (15) days of actual realization (for the absence of
doubt, without duplication, net of the amounts set forth in the parenthetical
set forth in clause (ii) above). The Indemnified Party shall use, and cause
its Affiliates to use, reasonable best efforts to seek prompt and full
recovery under all insurance and indemnity provisions covering such Loss to
the same extent as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. Except as set forth herein, from and after the Closing Date, no
member of the Supervalu Group shall have any right of contribution or
indemnification against any of the Save-A-Lot Entities for any amounts paid to
any Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of any claim for indemnification
under this Article X or any claim under this Article X arising from or
relating to a breach by Supervalu or any of the Save-A-Lot Entities or their
respective Subsidiaries of any representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement or in the Services Agreement. Upon
making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification claim
pursuant to Article VII or this Article X, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified
Party may have against any third parties (other than customers or store
licensees of the Business, the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, including
the Save-A-Lot Entities) with respect to the subject matter underlying such
indemnification claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assign any such rights
to the Indemnifying Party or, where such assignment is not permitted, use
commercially reasonable efforts to recover in respect such claim on behalf of
the Indemnifying Party. For purposes of this Section 10.6 and Section 10.7,
"Indemnified Party" shall include any Party entitled to be indemnified under
Article VII, and "Indemnifying Party" shall include any Party liable for such
indemnification.

10.7 Limitation of Liability. In no event shall any Indemnifying Party have
liability to any Indemnified Party for any (a) exemplary or punitive damages
of the other party or (b) consequential, special, incidental or indirect
damages, except in the case of the foregoing clause (b) to the extent such
damages resulting from the breach of a covenant or obligation under this
Agreement are reasonably foreseeable and except in each case in any of the
foregoing clause (a) or (b) for any such damages to the extent actually paid
to a third party, including a Governmental Authority. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) this Section 10.7 shall not limit the ability of the Purchaser Tax
Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification in relation to breaches relating
to the Section 336(e) Elections or 338(h)(10) Elections or of the Seller Tax
Indemnified Parties to seek indemnification relating to breaches relating to
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule and (ii) Section 10.7(b) shall not
apply to damages to the extent arising out of or related to any breach of
Section 3.15(a)(xii). 

10.8 Mitigation. Each of the Parties agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any
event or condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any
Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder.

10.9 No Set Off. Neither Party shall have any right to set off or otherwise
reduce or refuse to pay any amount required to be paid by it pursuant to
Article VII or this Article X, whether because of alleged or actual payments,
damages or liabilities owed by the other Party or any of its Affiliates to
such Party or any of its Affiliates, alleged or actual claims against the
other Party or any of its Affiliates or any other financial obligation of the
other Party or any of its Affiliates to such Party or any of its Affiliates.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Services Agreement, the
Separation Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or thereby,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be entitled to set off from payment due to
Supervalu or its Affiliates under the Services Agreement any amount paid to
any Governmental Authority with respect to the matters underlying the Tax
Reserves but only to the extent that such amounts are indemnifiable by
Supervalu in respect of such matters (in the relevant jurisdictions and for
the relevant taxable periods, as specified in Schedule VI) under Section 7.2,
and any amounts so set off shall be treated as having been paid by Supervalu
to Purchaser under Section 7.2 (and for the avoidance of doubt, such offset
shall not be limited to the specific amounts included in the Tax Reserves, but
rather the actual amounts paid in satisfaction of such matter(s) underlying
the Tax Reserves); provided that no Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party shall pay
or cause to be paid any Taxes with respect to any Liabilities included in such
Tax Reserves until legally required to do so.

ARTICLE XI

GENERAL PROVISIONS

11.1 Interpretation; Absence of Presumption.

(a) It is understood and agreed that the specification of any dollar amount in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules is not
intended to imply that such amounts or higher or lower amounts, or the items
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Party shall use
the fact of the setting of such amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any
such item in the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
in this Agreement or included in the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules is or is
not material for purposes of this Agreement.

(b) For the purposes of this Agreement, (i) words in the singular shall be
held to include the plural and vice versa, and words of one gender shall be
held to include the other gender as the context requires; (ii) references to
the terms Article, Section, paragraph, Exhibit and Schedule are references to
the Articles, Sections, paragraphs, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement
unless otherwise specified; (iii) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby,"
"hereto" and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement,
including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto; (iv) references to "$" shall mean
U.S. dollars; (v) the word "including" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement and the Services Agreement shall mean "including without
limitation," unless otherwise specified; (vi) the word "or" shall not be
exclusive; (vii) references to "written" or "in writing" include in electronic
form; (viii) provisions shall apply, when appropriate, to successive events
and 

transactions; (ix) the Parties have each participated in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and the Services Agreement and if an ambiguity or
question of interpretation should arise, this Agreement and the Services
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties thereto and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening either
Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions in this Agreement
or the Services Agreement; (x) a reference to any Person includes such
Person's successors and permitted assigns; (xi) any reference to "days" shall
mean calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified; and (xii)
when calculating the period of time before which, within which or following
which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this Agreement, the date
that is the reference date in calculating such period shall be excluded and if
the last day of such period is not a Business Day, the period shall end on the
next succeeding Business Day. If the Closing shall occur, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any payment obligation of
Purchaser hereunder shall be a joint and several obligation of Purchaser and
any domestic Save-A-Lot Entities.

(c) Any disclosure with respect to a Section or schedule of this Agreement,
including any Section of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules, shall be deemed
to be disclosed for other Sections and schedules of this Agreement, including
any Section of the Save-A-Lot Disclosure Schedules, to the extent that the
relevance of such disclosure to such other sections or schedules is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure.

11.2 Headings; Definitions. The section and article headings contained in this
Agreement and the Services Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference
only and will not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or
the Services Agreement.

11.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware (except that the laws of the
State of Missouri where expressly provided herein and to the extent required
by applicable Law). In addition, each of the Parties hereto (i) submits to the
exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery in and for
New Castle County, or in the event (but only in the event) that such Delaware
Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such dispute,
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, or in the event
(but only in the event) that such United States District Court also does not
have jurisdiction over such dispute, any Delaware State court sitting in New
Castle County, in the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort or
otherwise) arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
(iii) agrees that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other than the Delaware
Court of Chancery in and for New Castle County, or in the event (but only in
the event) that such Delaware Court of Chancery does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such Action, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, or in the event (but only in the event) that such United
States District Court also does not have jurisdiction over such Action, any
Delaware State court sitting in New Castle County. Each Party agrees that
service of process upon such Party in any such Action arising out of 

or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section
11.7.

(b) EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY ANY OF THEM AGAINST THE OTHER ARISING
OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS EXECUTED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR THE
ADMINISTRATION THEREOF OR THE TRANSACTION OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREIN OR THEREIN, INCLUDING (WITHOUT IN ANY WAY LIMITING SECTION
11.3(d) OR SECTION 11.14) ANY LITIGATION AGAINST A DEBT FINANCING SOURCE PARTY
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. NO
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT, PROCEEDING,
COUNTERCLAIM OR ANY OTHER LITIGATION PROCEDURE BASED UPON, OR ARISING OUT OF,
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENTS. NO PARTY WILL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE
ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN
WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT OR
INSTRUMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET
FORTH ABOVE IN THIS SECTION 11.3. NO PARTY HAS IN ANY WAY AGREED WITH OR
REPRESENTED TO ANY OTHER PARTY THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 11.3 WILL
NOT BE FULLY ENFORCED IN ALL INSTANCES.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but subject to Section
11.3(d) below, each Party agrees (i) that any Action of any kind or nature,
whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, against a Debt
Financing Source Party in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be brought
exclusively in any New York state or federal court sitting in the borough of
Manhattan and each party submits for itself and its property with respect to
any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) that
services of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail addressed
to it at its address provided in Section 11.7 shall be effective service of
process against it for any such action brought in any such court, (iii) to
waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of,
and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Action in any such court, (iv) that a final judgment in any such Action shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law, (v) that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof,
the Laws of the State of New York shall govern any such Action and (vi) to
irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in any such
action to the same extent such rights are waived pursuant to Section 11.3(b).

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Supervalu and each member
of the Supervalu Group hereby waives (and Supervalu shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each of its Affiliates to waive) to the fullest extent
permitted by Law any rights or claims against any Lenders and the parties to
any joinder agreements, credit agreements or commitment letters entered 

into in connection with the Debt Financing, and any of their Affiliates and
any of such entities' or their affiliates' respective former, current or
future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons, general or
limited partners, shareholders, managers, members, directors, officers,
employees, representatives or agents, and their respective successors and
assigns (collectively, the "Debt Financing Source Parties"), in connection
with this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters, whether at law or equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise; provided that the foregoing waiver and
release shall not apply to any rights, claims or causes of action that
Supervalu or any member of the Supervalu Group may have against any Lender for
breach of any nondisclosure agreement that any Lender may have entered into
with the any member of the Supervalu Group.

11.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Separation Agreement,
the Services Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto, and
the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between the
Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede any
prior discussion, correspondence, negotiation, proposed term sheet, agreement,
understanding or arrangement, and there are no agreements, understandings,
representations or warranties between the Parties other than those set forth
or referred to in this Agreement.

11.5 No Third Party Beneficiaries. Except (a) as provided in Sections 5.11(b),
7.2, 7.3, 10.2 and 10.3, in each case which are intended to benefit, and to be
enforceable by, the parties specified therein, (b) each of the Purchaser
Related Parties (as applicable), who shall be express third party
beneficiaries of, and entitled to enforce, Sections 9.3, 9.4, 11.3(b),
11.3(c), 11.3(d), 11.4, 11.9, 11.10, 11.14 and this Section 11.5, and (c) Onex
Partners Manager LP, which shall be a third party beneficiary of, and entitled
to enforce, Section 5.2(a), this Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto, are not intended to confer in or on behalf of any Person not a Party
to this Agreement (and their successors and assigns) any rights, benefits,
causes of action or remedies with respect to the subject matter or any
provision hereof.

11.6 Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or not, all legal
and other costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such costs and expenses unless expressly otherwise contemplated in
this Agreement (with an understanding that any such costs and expenses
incurred prior to the Closing by any of the Save-A-Lot Entities, to the extent
not included as a "Current Liability" in Working Capital or not included in
Indebtedness, shall be the sole responsibility of Supervalu except as
otherwise provided in the Separation Agreement (including the schedules
thereto)); provided, however, the expenses of Purchaser to obtain
representations and warranties insurance in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne by Purchaser.

11.7 Notices. All notices and other communications to be given to any Party
hereunder shall be sufficiently given for all purposes hereunder if in writing
and delivered by hand, courier or overnight delivery service, or three (3)
days after being mailed by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, with appropriate postage prepaid, and shall be directed to the

11.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and their respective successors
and assigns; provided, that no Party to this Agreement may directly or
indirectly assign any or all of its rights or delegate any or all of its
obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written consent of
each other Party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, without
Supervalu's consent (a) Purchaser may assign its rights hereunder for
collateral security purposes to its debt financing sources (including the
Lenders), or any collateral agent or trustee therefor, and (b) Purchaser may
assign any rights and obligations hereunder to its Affiliates (so long as they
remain Affiliates); provided that in the case of any assignment described in
clause (a) or (b), no such assignment shall limit, affect or relieve the
assignor of its obligations hereunder.

11.9 Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may not be modified or amended
except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed by each of the
Parties. Supervalu or Purchaser may, only by an instrument in writing, waive
compliance by the other Parties to this Agreement with any term or provision
of this Agreement on the part of such other Parties to this Agreement to be
performed or complied with. The waiver by any such Party to this Agreement of
a breach of or requirement to comply with any term or provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or
requirement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Sections 9.3, 9.4, 11.3(b), 11.4, 11.3(c), 11.3(d), 11.5, 11.10, 11.14 and
this Section 11.9 (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of Sections 9.3, 9.4, 11.3(b), 11.3(c), 11.3(d), 11.4, 11.5,
11.10, 11.14 and this last sentence of Section 11.9) may not be amended,
modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any respect to
the Debt Financing Source Parties without the prior written consent of the
Lenders.

11.10 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to
be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party hereto. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties intend that the
remedies and limitations set forth in this Agreement (including (x) provisions
that payment of the Reverse Termination Fee be the exclusive remedy for the
recipient thereof and (y) limitations on the right to specifically enforce the
terms hereof) shall be construed as an integral provision of this Agreement
and that such remedies and limitations shall not be severable in any manner
that increases (i) the liability of Purchaser (or the liability of any Lender)
or any of its stockholders, partners, members, managers, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents or (ii) the
obligations hereunder or under the Guaranty.

11.11 Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage,
for which monetary damages (even if available) would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not perform any
provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and 

agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled in Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of any such injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that any other
Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that any award of specific performance
is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity. Any Party
seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
order or injunction. If, prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any
Action to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions
hereof by any other Party, then notwithstanding Section 9.1(b)(i) the Outside
Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during which
such action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time
period established by the court presiding over such action. The Parties agree
that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Supervalu shall be
entitled to specific performance (or any other equitable relief) of
Purchaser's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the
Purchase Price and of Purchaser's obligation to consummate the Closing;
provided, however, that Supervalu shall be entitled to such specific
performance only if: (i) all conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 shall
have been satisfied as of the date on which the Closing would be required to
occur (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied
at the Closing; provided such conditions would reasonably be expected to have
been satisfied as of such date) or have been waived, (ii) the Debt Financing
(or, if Alternate Financing is being used in accordance with Section 5.11(a),
pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) has been funded or would be
funded (or, if such Debt Financing has been funded into escrow, such funds
have been or would be released from escrow) as of the date on which the
Closing would be required to occur if the Equity Financing is funded, and
(iii) Supervalu has confirmed in writing that if specific performance is
granted and the Financing is funded, it will take such actions as are required
of it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur;
provided, further, that while Supervalu may pursue both a grant of specific
performance in accordance with this Section 11.11 and the Reverse Termination
Fee, under no circumstances shall Supervalu be entitled to receive both (1) a
grant of specific performance that requires the Equity Financing to be funded
and/or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
(which specific performance order is satisfied) and (2) the payment of the
Reverse Termination Fee. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
fails to grant specific performance or other injunctive relief to Supervalu as
a remedy for any failure to perform or breach hereunder, or in any
circumstance in which damages are recoverable by Supervalu hereunder, the
Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Supervalu shall be entitled to
receive benefit of the bargain and lost profits damages as redress for such
failure to perform or breach.

11.12 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of Attorney-
Client Privilege.

(a) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Save-A-Lot Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation,
after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of Supervalu, any of
its Subsidiaries or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of
Supervalu or any of its Subsidiaries (any such Person, a "Designated Person")
in any matter involving this Agreement, the 

Services Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, by any legal counsel currently representing Supervalu or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement, the Services Agreement or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz (the "Current Representation").

(b) Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Save-A-Lot Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any
legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute with Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and
following the Closing, with any Save-A-Lot Entity (including in respect of any
claim for indemnification by Purchaser), it being the intention of the Parties
hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control
such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Supervalu; provided, that
the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement, the Services Agreement or any
other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or to
communications with any Person other than the Designated Persons and their
advisors. Accordingly, from and after Closing, the Save-A-Lot Entities shall
not have any access to any such communications or to the files of the Current
Representation relating to such engagement, and none of Purchaser, the Save-A-
Lot Entities or any Person acting or purporting to act on their behalf shall
seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications and files belongs to Supervalu.

11.13 No Admission. Nothing herein shall be deemed an admission by Supervalu
or any of its respective Affiliates, in any Action or proceeding by or on
behalf of a third party, that Supervalu or any of its respective Affiliates,
or that such third party or any of its respective Affiliates, is or is not in
breach or violation of, or in default in, the performance or observance of any
term or provisions of any contract.

11.14 Limitation on Recourse. Other than with respect to (a) the right to seek
specific performance of the Equity Commitment Letter to the extent permitted
by and in accordance with Section 11.11 and the Equity Commitment Letter (any
such claims under the Equity Commitment Letter, the "ECL Claims"), (b)
recourse against the Guarantor under the Guaranty to the extent permitted by
and in accordance with the Guaranty, (c) the recourse rights of any party
pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent provided therein and
(d) the recourse rights of any party under the Separation Agreement or the
Services Agreement to the extent provided therein, any claim or cause of
action under this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as Parties, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth in this Agreement. Other than the ECL Claims, such
recourse against the Guarantor under the Guaranty to the extent permitted by
and in accordance with the Guaranty, such recourse against a party under the
Confidentiality Agreement and such recourse against a party under the
Separation Agreement or the Services Agreement to the extent provided therein,
and subject to the rights of, and without restricting, limiting or modifying
the obligations of, the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter, no Purchaser
Related Party or Supervalu Related Party (other than Supervalu or Purchaser,
subject, in each case, to this Section 11.14 and Sections 9.3 and 9.4
(including the limitations on liability contained therein)) shall have any
liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, obligations or liabilities of Supervalu or Purchaser or of or for
any claim, 

investigation, or Action, in each case under, based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder
(including the breach, termination or failure to consummate such
transactions), in each case whether based on contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
Action, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise
and whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited
liability company or partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf
of a party or another Person (including a claim to enforce the Debt Commitment
Letter) or otherwise. Subject to the rights of, and without restricting,
limiting or modifying the obligations of, the parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter under the terms thereof, none of the Parties, solely in their
respective capacities as parties to this Agreement, shall have any rights or
claims against any Debt Financing Source Party, solely in their respective
capacities as lenders or arrangers under the Debt Financing, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise.

11.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic method shall be as effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.
