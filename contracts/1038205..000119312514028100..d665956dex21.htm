Section 1.05  _Effective Time; Closing_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer, Buyer Bank,
Company and Company Bank will make all such filings as may be required to

assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Company, Company Bank and their
respective officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to
Buyer and Buyer Bank, and each or any of them, an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and

 



2  deliver, in such official corporate capacities, all such deeds, assignments
or assurances in law or any other acts as are necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of Buyer
or Buyer Bank, as applicable, are authorized in the name of Company, Company
Bank or otherwise to take any and all such action.

 

ARTICLE II

MERGER CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

Section 2.01 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, automatically by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Buyer Bank, Company Bank, Company or
any shareholder of Company:

 

(a) Each share of Buyer Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding
following the Effective Time and shall be unchanged by the Merger.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock owned directly by Buyer (other than
shares in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like for the benefit of
customers or shares held as collateral for outstanding debt previously
contracted) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and
retired at the Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

(c) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock, Dissenting Shares and
shares described in Section 2.01(b) above) shall, subject in all cases to
Section 2.02, become and be converted at the election of the holder thereof,
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.06, into the right to
receive the following consideration, without interest:

 

(i) For each whole share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive Buyer Common Stock has been effectively made by a holder
of Company Common Stock and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section
2.06 (each a "Stock Election," and the number of whole shares of Company
Common Stock with respect to which such election has been made, "Stock
Election Shares"), or with respect to which the Exchange Agent has made an
allocation of the right to receive Buyer Common Stock under Section 2.02, the
Stock Consideration.

 

(ii) For each whole share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an
election to receive cash has been effectively made by a holder of Company
Common Stock and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant to Section 2.06 (each
a "Cash Election," and the number of whole shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to which such election has been made, the "Cash Election Shares"), or
with respect to which the Exchange Agent has made an allocation of the right
to receive cash under Section 2.02, the Cash Consideration. For purposes of
clarification, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be deemed to have
made a Cash Election or a Stock Election with respect to such Dissenting
Shares and such Dissenting Shares shall not be deemed Cash Election Shares,
Stock Election Shares or Non-Election Shares.

 



3 (iii) For each whole share of Company Common Stock other than (A)
Dissenting Shares and (B) shares as to which a Stock Election and/or a Cash
Election has been effectively made and not revoked or deemed revoked pursuant
to Section 2.06 (collectively, the "Non-Election Shares"), the Stock
Consideration, as determined in accordance with Section 2.02.

(d) At least 80% of the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid to holders
of Company Common Stock will be paid with Buyer Common Stock. Holders of
record of shares of Company Common Stock shall have the right to submit an
election to receive Buyer Common Stock or cash for each of their Company
shares in accordance with Section 2.06. However, to the extent that the
aggregate of those elections would result in less than 80% of the aggregate
Merger Consideration being paid with Buyer Common Stock, pro-rata adjustments
will be made by the Exchange Agent as provided in Section 2.02 to result in a
payment of at least 80% of the aggregate Merger Consideration in Buyer Common
Stock and the balance of the aggregate Merger Consideration in cash.

 

(e) Within one (1) Business Day after the Determination Date, the Company
shall terminate and cancel each issued and outstanding Company Stock Option
and SAR and the Company shall pay, no later than five (5) Business Days prior
to the Effective Time, each holder thereof a cash payment equal to the
difference between the per share exercise price, as set forth in
such holders award agreement with respect to such Company Stock Option or
SAR, and the Company Stock Price.

(f) Company shall take all requisite action so that, prior to the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option, SAR or other Right, contingent or accrued, to
acquire or receive Company Common Stock or benefits measured by the value of
such shares, and each award of any kind consisting of Company Common Stock
that may be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance under
the Company Stock Plan, or otherwise, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action, terminated and cancelled. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions (including obtaining any consents) that may
be necessary to effectuate the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this
Section 2.01.

Section 2.02 _Proration_. Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective
Time, if the aggregate of the elections made by the shareholders of Company
Common Stock would result in less than 80% of the aggregate Merger
Consideration being paid with Buyer Common Stock, Buyer shall cause the
Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Company Common
Stock of rights to receive Buyer Common Stock or cash in the Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows:

 

(a) _Stock Undersubscribed_. If the sum of (1) Cash Election Shares _plus_ (2)
any Dissenting Shares, _is greater than_ 20% of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, then:

 



4 (i) each of the Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

(ii) each of the Cash Election Shares shall be converted into:

 

(A) a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio
_multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of (1) the
number of Cash Election Shares _plus_ any Dissenting Shares, _minus_ (2) 20%
of the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and the denominator of which is the
total number of Cash Election Shares; and

(B) an amount of cash equal to (1) the Fully Diluted Company Stock Price
_less_ (2) the dollar value of the Stock Consideration to be received as
provided in clause (A) immediately above, which shall be determined by taking
the number determined in clause (A) immediately above and _multiplying_ it by
the Buyer Average Stock Price.

(b) _Stock Subscriptions Sufficient_. If the number of Cash Election Shares
together with any Dissenting Shares is equal to or less than 20% of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, then subparagraph (a) above shall not apply and (1) all
Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive only Cash
Consideration in the amount of the Fully Diluted Company Stock Price; (2)
solely for purposes of calculating the proration provided in this Section
2.02(b), all Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be converted into the right
to receive only Cash Consideration in the amount of the Fully Diluted Company
Stock Price; and (3) subject to Section 2.04 and Section 2.06, all Stock
Election Shares and Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive only Stock Consideration with the number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock determined using the Exchange Ratio.

 

Section 2.03 _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. All shares of Company
Common Stock, when converted as provided in Section 2.01(c), shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and each Certificate previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock in accordance with this ARTICLE II and the right
to receive any unpaid dividend with respect to the Company Common Stock with
a record date that is on or prior to December 18, 2013. At the Effective
Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no

Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock as
provided under this ARTICLE II, and the right to receive any unpaid dividend
with respect to the Company Common Stock with a record date that is on or

Company Common Stock.

 



5 Section 2.04 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of
a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock, rounded to the nearest one
hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest in Buyer Common Stock to which such
holder would otherwise be entitled by the Buyer Average Stock Price.

Section 2.05 _Plan of Reorganization_. It is intended that the Merger and the
Bank Merger shall together constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that
term is used in Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. The business purpose of the
Merger and the Bank Merger is to combine two financial institutions to create
a strong community-based commercial banking franchise. From and after the date
of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
under Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

Section 2.06 _Election Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company
Common Stock ("Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in this ARTICLE II, to submit an election in accordance with the
following procedures:

(a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.06 (each, an "Election") (i) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such
Holder desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder
desires to make a Cash Election.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Company Meeting, assuming the
Requisite Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, but in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, and provided that
Company has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Exchange Agent all
information that is necessary for the Exchange Agent to perform its
obligations as specified herein, the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
Exchange Agent Agreement shall mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to each
holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates who has not previously
surrendered such Certificate or Certificates an Election Form and Letter of
Transmittal, as hereinafter defined, to include or be accompanied by
appropriate and customary transmittal materials, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, as
well as instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided for in this
Agreement (collectively, the "Election Form and Letter of Transmittal" or
"Election Form"). The form of Election Form and Letter of Transmittal shall be
agreed to between Company and Buyer not later than the time of filing of
the Registration Statement. Each Election Form and Letter of Transmittal
shall permit such Holder, subject to the allocation and election procedures
set forth in this Section 2.06, to (i) elect to receive the Cash Consideration
for all of the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder in
accordance with Section 2.01(c), (ii) elect to receive the Stock Consideration
for all of such shares in accordance with Section 2.01(c), (iii) elect to
receive the Stock Consideration for a specified number of whole shares of
such Holders Company Common Stock and the Cash Consideration for the
remaining number of whole shares of such Holders Company Common Stock or (iv)
indicate that such Holder has no

 



6  preference as to the receipt of cash or Buyer Common Stock for such shares
(a "Non-Election"). A Holder who holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in
another representative capacity (a "Representative") may submit multiple
Election Forms, _provided, that_ each such Election Form covers all of the
shares of Company Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular
beneficial owner. Any shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
the Holder thereof has not, as of the Election Deadline, made an election by
submission to the Exchange Agent of an effective, properly completed Election
Form shall be deemed Non-Election Shares.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, a
Holder who (i) makes a Stock Election that would result in such Holder
receiving less than ten (10) whole shares of Buyer Common Stock, or (ii) would
otherwise be allocated Stock Consideration consisting of less than ten (10)
whole shares of Buyer Common Stock under this Section 2.06 as a result of a
Non-Election or deemed Non-Election or (iii) would otherwise be allocated
Stock Consideration consisting of less than ten (10) whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock pursuant to the allocation and pro-ration provisions of Section
2.02, shall instead in any such case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, be allocated
Cash Consideration in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock as if
such Holder had made a valid Election to receive Cash Consideration
in respect of such shares of Company Common Stock.

(d) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form, accompanied by the
Certificate(s) to which such Election Form relates, shall be submitted to the
Exchange Agent no later than 5:00 p.m., Central time, on the date that Buyer
and Company agree is as near as practicable to five (5) Business Days before
the anticipated Effective Time (or such other time and date as Buyer and
Company may mutually agree, and as to be set forth in the Election Form) (the
"Election Deadline"). Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform the duties as specified
herein. An Election shall be deemed to have been properly made only if the
Exchange Agent shall have duly received a properly completed Election Form,
accompanied by the Certificate(s) to which such Election Form relates, by the
Election Deadline, unless a Holder elects to make delivery of the
Certificate(s) pursuant to a guarantee of delivery as provided in the Election
Form, in which case a properly completed Election Form shall be delivered to
and received by the Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, and the
Certificates(s) shall be delivered pursuant to the guarantee of delivery as
provided in the Election Form no later than two (2) Business Days after the
Election Deadline. If a Holder either (i) does not submit a properly
completed Election Form and the Certificate(s) in a timely fashion or (ii)
revokes his, her or its Election Form before the Election Deadline (without
later submitting a properly completed Election Form before the Election
Deadline), the shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder shall be
designated as Non-Election Shares. Any Holder may revoke or change his, her or
its Election by written notice to the Exchange Agent only if such notice of
revocation or change is duly received by the Exchange Agent before the
Election Deadline. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Form, the Exchange Agent shall have sole authority to determine when any
Election, modification or revocation is received and whether any such
Election, modification or revocation has been properly made.

 



7 Section 2.07 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) A reasonable time in advance of the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent (a) stock
certificates representing the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
sufficient to deliver, and Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely
deliver, the Aggregate Stock Consideration, (b) immediately available funds
equal to the Aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then
determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.04), and (c) if applicable, cash in an aggregate amount sufficient
to make the appropriate payment to the holders of Dissenting Shares
(collectively, the "Exchange Fund"), and Buyer shall instruct the Exchange
Agent to timely pay Cash Consideration, and such cash in lieu of fractional
shares, and Stock Consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and to
hold the cash deposited with the Exchange Agent in order to pay the holders of
Dissenting Shares upon Buyers request such cash to which they become entitled
upon perfection of their dissenters rights in accordance with the ABCA.

(b) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company for six (6) months after the Effective Time (as well
as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with Section 2.05 and this Section 2.07 shall thereafter
look only to Buyer for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If outstanding
Certificates for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the
payment for them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of
Buyer Common Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to
the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable Law,
become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession shall be
delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock represented by any Certificate for any Merger Consideration (or any
dividends or distributions with respect to the Stock Consideration) paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws. Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock
transfer books of Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books
shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute
with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock represented
by any Certificate, Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender
to the custody of any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration
represented by such Certificate and file legal proceedings interpleading all
parties to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

Section 2.08 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates,
accompanied by a properly completed Election Form and Letter of Transmittal
timely delivered to the Exchange Agent, a Holder will be entitled to receive
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration
(with the aggregate Cash Consideration paid to each 

 



8  such holder rounded to the nearest whole cent) and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor (with such cash rounded to the nearest whole cent) in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate or Certificates.
The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case may be, shall not be obligated to
deliver cash and/or shares of Buyer Common Stock to a holder of Company
Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled as a result of
the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates
representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as provided in
this ARTICLE II, or, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement
and/or a bond in such amount as may be required in each case by Buyer (but not
more than the customary amount required under Buyers agreement with its
transfer agent). 

(b) No dividends or other distributions with a record date after December 18,
2013 with respect to Company Common Stock shall be valid in any respect or
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.08, the record holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive any theretofore unpaid dividends or other
distributions with a record date on or prior to December 18, 2013, without any
interest thereon, with respect to shares of Company Common Stock represented
by such Certificate.

 

(c) Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Buyer is required to deduct and withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so
deducted and withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

Section 2.09  _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event that on or after the
first trading day used in determining the Buyer Average Stock Price and before
the Effective Time Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for changing)
the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Buyer Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be appropriately adjusted;
_provided that_ , for the avoidance of doubt, no such adjustment shall be made
with regard to the Buyer Common Stock if (i) Buyer issues additional
shares of Buyer Common Stock and receives consideration for such shares in a
bona fide third party transaction, or (ii) Buyer issues employee or director
stock options, restricted stock awards, grants or similar equity awards or
Buyer issues Buyer Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of any such options,
grants or awards.

Section 2.10 _Dissenting Shareholders_. Any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock who perfects his, her or its dissenters rights (the aggregate
shares of all such holders constituting the "Dissenting Shares") in accordance
with and as contemplated by §4-27-1302 and §4-27-1322 of the ABCA, shall be
entitled to receive the value of such shares in cash as determined pursuant to
such provision of Law; _provided, that_ no such payment shall be made to any
dissenting shareholder unless and until such dissenting shareholder has
complied with the notice and other applicable provisions of the ABCA and
surrendered to Company, or after the Effective Time to Buyer, the Certificate
or Certificates representing the shares for which 

 



9  payment is being made. In the event that, whether before or after the
Effective Time, a dissenting shareholder of Company fails to perfect, or
effectively withdraws or loses, his, her or its right to dissent and of
payment for his, her or its shares, subject to Buyers consent in its sole
discretion, Buyer shall issue and deliver the Merger Consideration to which
such holder of shares of Company Common Stock is entitled under this ARTICLE
II (without interest), upon surrender by such holder of the Certificate or
Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder.

(a) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts, policies or arrangements
(i) covering current or former employees of Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or related organizations described in Code Sections 414(b),(c) or (m)
("Controlled Group Members") (collectively, the "Company Employees"), (ii)
covering current or former directors of Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
Controlled Group Members, or (iii) with respect to which the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries, or any Controlled Group Members has or may have any
liability or contingent liability (including liability arising
from affiliation under Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA)
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA, health/welfare, change in control, fringe
benefit, deferred compensation, stock option, stock purchase, stock
appreciation rights, stock based, incentive, bonus plans and other policies,
plans or arrangements whether or not subject to ERISA (the "Company Benefit
Plans"), are identified and described in _Disclosure Schedule Section
3.16(a)_. Neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members
has any stated plan, intention or commitment to establish any new company
benefit plan or to modify any Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent
required by law).

(b) Company has provided Buyer with true and complete copies of all Company
Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and
insurance contracts forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, summary plan descriptions and summary of material
modifications, IRS Form 5500 (for the three most recently completed plan
years), the most recent IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory
letters, with respect thereto and any correspondence from any regulatory
agency. In addition any annual and periodic accounting, service contract,
fidelity bonds and employee and participant disclosures pertaining to the
Company Benefit Plans have been made available to the Buyer.

 



18 (c) All Company Benefit Plans are in compliance in form and operation with all
applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan
which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code ("Company
401(a) Plan"), has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from
the IRS, and neither Company nor Company Bank is aware of any circumstance
that could reasonably be expected to result in revocation of any such
favorable determination or opinion letter or the loss of the qualification of
such Company 401(a) Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code, and nothing has
occurred that would be expected to result in the Company 401(a) Plan ceasing
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. All Company Benefit Plans
have been administered in accordance with their terms. There is no pending
or, to Companys Knowledge, threatened litigation or regulatory action
relating to the Company Benefit Plans. Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Members has engaged in a transaction
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including a Company 401(a) Plan that
could subject Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Members
to a tax or penalty under any Law including, but not limited to, Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. No Company 401(a) Plan has been
submitted under or been the subject of an IRS voluntary compliance program
submission. There are no audits, investigations, inquiries or
proceedings pending or threatened by the IRS or the Department of Labor with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan.

(d) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled
Group Members with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single
employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently
or formerly maintained by Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Controlled Group
Members or any entity which is considered one employer with Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither Company, Company Bank
nor any ERISA Affiliate (or their predecessor) has ever maintained a plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of Company,
Company Bank, or any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to (or been obligated to
contribute to) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of
ERISA at any time and neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled
Group Members has incurred, and does not expect to incur, any withdrawal
liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of
ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate).
No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
has been required to be filed for any Company Benefit Plan or by any ERISA
Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) All contributions required to be made with respect to all Company Benefit
Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the consolidated
financial statements of Company. No Company Benefit Plan or single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or
not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding funding waiver.

(f) No Company Benefit Plan provides or has any liability to provide life
insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits to any Company Employee
upon his or her retirement or termination of employment for any reason, except
as may be required by Law, and neither Company nor any Subsidiary has ever
represented or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Company
Employee (either individually, or to Company Employees as a group) that such
Company Employee(s) would be provided with life insurance, medical or other
employee welfare benefits, upon their retirement or termination of employment.

 



19 (g) All Company Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been operated
in compliance with the group health plan continuation requirements of Section
4980B of the Code and all other applicable sections of ERISA and the Code.
Company may amend or terminate any such Company Benefit Plan at any time
without incurring any liability thereunder for further benefits coverage at
any time after such termination.

(h) Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.16(h)_ or
otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any Company
Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting (except as required by law) or trigger any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or
violation of, or a default under, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (iv)
result in any payment that would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified
individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without
regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal
services performed or to be performed in the future, (v) limit or restrict the
right of Company or Company Bank or, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans, or (vi) result in
payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans which would not be deductible
under Section 280G of the Code.

 

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan or
arrangement is in compliance with Section 409A of the Code, to the extent
applicable. All elections made with respect to compensation deferred under an
arrangement subject to Section 409A of the Code have been made in accordance
with the requirements of Section 409A(a)(4) of the Code, to the
extent applicable. Neither Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled
Group Members (i) has taken any action, or has failed to take any action, that
has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in the interest and tax
penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code being owed by any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan or (ii) has agreed to reimburse or
indemnify any participant in a Company Benefit Plan for any of the interest
and the penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code that may be
currently due or triggered in the future.

(j) _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.16(j)_ contains a schedule showing the
present value of the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in such
schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement, such as tax indemnification payments in respect of income
or excise taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or
similar contract, plan or arrangement with or which covers any present or
former director, officer or employee of Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Controlled Group Members who may be entitled to any such amount and
identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-kind benefits due under
any Company Benefit Plans (other than a plan qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code) for each such person, specifying the assumptions in such schedule
and providing estimates of other required contributions to any trusts for any
related fees or expenses.

 



20 (k) Company and its Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals who
directly or indirectly perform services for the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members for purposes of each Company Benefit
Plan, ERISA, the Code, unemployment compensation laws, workers compensation
laws and all other applicable Laws.

Section 3.17 _Labor Matters_. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
there any proceeding pending or, to Companys Knowledge threatened, asserting
that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor
practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act) or seeking
to compel Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bargain with any labor
organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to Companys Knowledge,
threatened, nor is Company or Company Bank aware of any activity involving
Company Employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging
in other organizational activity.

any predecessor, that has formed or that could reasonably be expected to form
the basis of any Environmental Claim against Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Except as disclosed on _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.18_, neither

reporting, investigation, remediation or monitoring under Environmental Law.

 

(e) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received (i) any written

Authority concerning a possible violation of, or liability under, any
Environmental Law.

 



21 (f) Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of any

and which Company is contesting in good faith. Company is not currently the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return, and,
except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.19,_ neither Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries currently has any open tax years. Since December

contract, or otherwise.

 



23 (g) The unpaid Taxes of Company (i) did not, as of November 30, 2013, exceed
the reserve for Tax liability (which reserve is distinct and different from
any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences
between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the Financial Statements
delivered to Buyer (rather than in any notes thereto), and (ii) do not exceed
that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time in accordance with the past
custom and practice of Company in filing its Tax Returns. Since December 31,
2012, Company has not incurred any liability for Taxes arising from
extraordinary gains or losses, as that term is used in GAAP, outside the

Company and its Subsidiaries, as well as any purchases or sales of such
securities between the Company Balance Sheet Date to and including the date
hereof, reflecting with respect to all such securities, whenever purchased or
sold, descriptions thereof, CUSIP numbers, designations as securities
"available for sale" or securities "held to maturity," as those terms are used
in ASC 320, book values, fair values and coupon rates, and any gain or loss
with respect to any investment securities sold during such time period after
the Company Balance Sheet Date. Except as set forth in _Disclosure Schedule
Section 3.20_, neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has purchased or
sold any such securities listed and described thereon. Neither Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries owns any of the outstanding equity of any savings bank,
savings and loan association, savings and loan holding company, credit union,

in good faith to be bona fide, (2) such Acquisition Proposal was not the
result of a violation of this Section 5.09, (3) the Companys board of
directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice from outside

of directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice from outside
counsel) that the failure to take the actions referred to in clause (x) or (y)
below would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, then Company may (and may authorize its representatives to)
(x) furnish nonpublic information regarding Company to the person making such
Acquisition Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement containing terms substantially similar to, and no
less favorable to Company than, those contained in the confidentiality
agreement with Buyer, and (y) participate in discussions and negotiations with
the person making such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) The board of directors of Company shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, change or qualify (or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend,
modify, change or qualify), in a manner adverse in any respect to the
interests of Buyer, its recommendation referred to in Section 5.04, or (ii)
approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend or announce
its intention to approve, recommend or propose) any Acquisition Proposal
(either (i) or (ii), an "Adverse Recommendation Change"). Company shall not,
and its board of directors shall not allow Company to, and Company shall not
allow any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time before obtaining approval of the
Merger by Companys shareholders, Companys board of directors may, if
Companys board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving advice
from outside counsel) that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, taking into account all
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be offered by Buyer under
this Section 5.09(b), make an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that
Company may not make any Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Acquisition Proposal unless (x) Company shall not have breached this Section
5.09 in any respect and (y):

 

(i) The Companys board of directors determines in good faith (after receiving
advice from outside counsel and its financial advisor) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal and such Superior Proposal has been made and
has not been withdrawn and continues to be a Superior Proposal after taking
into account all adjustments to the terms of this Agreement that may be
offered by Buyer under this Section 5.09(b);

 



44 (ii) Company has given Buyer at least four Business Days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal) and has
contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the person making such Superior Proposal; and

(iii) Before effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change, Company has
negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Buyer during such notice period to the extent Buyer wishes to negotiate,
to enable Buyer to revise the terms of this Agreement such that it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal.

In the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior Proposal,
Company shall, in each case, be required to deliver to Buyer a new written
notice, the notice period shall have recommenced and Company shall be required
to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.09 with respect to such
new written notice.

(c) In addition to the obligations of Company under Section 5.09(a) and
Section 5.09(b), Company shall notify Buyer promptly (but in no event later
than 24 hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material
modification of or material amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or records of Company or
any Subsidiary by any person that informs the Companys board of directors or
any Subsidiary that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice to Buyer shall be made orally and in writing, and shall
indicate the identity of the person making the Acquisition Proposal or
intending to make or considering making an Acquisition Proposal or requesting
nonpublic information or access to the books and records of Company or any
Subsidiary, and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or
modification or amendment to an Acquisition Proposal. Company shall keep
Buyer fully informed, on a current basis, of any material changes in the
status and any material changes or modifications in the terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. Company shall also promptly, and
in any event within 24 hours, notify Buyer, orally and in writing, if it
enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal in
accordance with Section 5.09(a).

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company from informing
any Person of the existence of the provisions contained in this Section 5.09.

(e) As used in this Section 5.09, "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal
for a merger or other business combination involving Company, Company Bank or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or for the acquisition of a significant
equity interest in Company, Company Bank or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or for the acquisition of a significant portion of the assets or
liabilities of Company, Company Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



45 (f) As used in this Section 5.09, "Superior Proposal" means a bona
fide, unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result
in a third party (or in the case of a direct merger between such third party
and Company or Company Bank, the shareholders of such third party) acquiring,
directly or indirectly, more than 75% of the outstanding Company Common Stock
or more than 75% of the assets of Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, (ii) that
Companys board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, (A) is
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal, including all
conditions contained therein and the person making such takeover proposal, and
(B) taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed by Buyer in
response to such takeover proposal, as contemplated by paragraph (c) of this
Section 5.09, and all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
takeover proposal, including all conditions contained therein and the person
making such proposal, is more favorable to the shareholders of Company from a
financial point of view than the Merger.

Section 5.10 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and in
any event subject to the provisions of Section 5.10(b)(iv), Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former directors and
officers of Company and Company Bank (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, settlements or liabilities as incurred, in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (each a "Claim"), arising out of
actions or omissions of such persons in the course of performing their duties
for Company or Company Bank occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated hereby), to the same extent as such
persons have the right to be indemnified pursuant to the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Company or Company Bank, in effect on the date of
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.10 shall promptly notify Buyer upon learning of any Claim, provided that
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of Buyer under this
Section 5.10, unless, and only to the extent that, Buyer is actually and
materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the
event of any such Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time),
(i) Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Buyer shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified
Parties in connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii) Buyer shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent and (iv)
Buyer shall have no obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Party if such
indemnification would be in violation of any applicable federal or state
banking Laws or regulations, or in the event that a federal or state banking
agency or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Laws and regulations, whether or not related to
banking Laws.

(c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Buyer will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to provide directors and officers liability
insurance (herein, "DandO Insurance") that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors of

 



46  Company or its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with
respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated hereby), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage
and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party, as that coverage currently provided by Company; 
_provided_ that if Buyer is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called
for by this Section 5.10, Buyer will provide as much comparable insurance as
is reasonably available (subject to the limitations described below in
this Section 5.10(c)); and _provided, further,_ that officers and directors
of Company or its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall Buyer be
required to expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an
amount equal to 200% of the annual premiums paid by the Company for DandO
Insurance in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail
Premium"). If the cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail
Premium, Buyer shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail
insurance policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

(d) If Buyer or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10. 

The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party, and each Indemnified Partys
heirs and personal and legal representatives.

Section 5.11 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) All Company Employees to whom Buyer in its sole discretion offers
employment at or prior to the Effective Time shall be retained as "at will"
employees after the Effective Time as employees of Buyer Bank so long as such
Company Employees accept the terms and conditions of employment specified by
Buyer; provided, that continued retention by Buyer Bank of such
employees subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject to Buyer Banks
normal and customary employment procedures and practices, including customary
background screening and evaluation procedures, and satisfactory employment
performance. In addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyers
reasonable request, to facilitate discussions between Buyer and Company
Employees a reasonable time in advance of the Closing Date regarding
employment, consulting or other arrangements to be effective prior to or
following the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, any interaction
between Buyer and Company Employees shall be coordinated by Company or Company
Bank.

 

(b) Company Employees (other than those listed on _Disclosure Schedule Section
5.11_ who are parties to an employment, change of control or other type of
agreement which provides for severance) as of the date of the Agreement who
remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
and whose employment is terminated by Buyer or Buyer 

 



47  Bank (absent termination for cause as determined by the employer) within one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall receive severance pay
in accordance with Buyers standard policies (which may include a general
release and waiver of all claims) equal to one (1) week of base weekly pay for
each completed year of employment service commencing with any such employees
most recent hire date with Company or any of its Subsidiaries and ending with
such employees termination date with Buyer, with a minimum payment equal to
two (2) weeks of base pay and a maximum payment equal to twelve (12) weeks of
base pay. Subject to the terms of the severance agreement and general
release, such severance payment will be made within thirty (30) days after
such employees termination date, subject to execution by such employee of any
required general release and waiver of all claims. Such severance payments
will be in lieu of any severance pay plans that may be in effect at Company or
any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. No officer or employee of
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is, or shall be, entitled to receive
duplicative severance payments and benefits under (i) an employment or
severance agreement; (ii) a severance or change of control plan; (iii) this
Section 5.11; or (iv) any other program or arrangement. 

(c) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, not later than ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall take all action
required to (i) cause any Company Benefit Plan that has liabilities in respect
of its participants, to be fully funded to the extent necessary to pay out all
required benefits, (ii) terminate all such plans effective as of Closing and
(iii) commence the process to pay out any vested benefits thereunder to
participating and eligible Company Employees in such form or forms as Company
or Company Bank elects and as permitted or required under applicable
Law. Distributions of benefits under any profit sharing plan of the Company
or Company Bank shall occur in accordance with such plans terms, and a
participant in such plan will be allowed to take, at the participants option:
(x) a direct distribution from such plan, (y) a rollover to an Individual
Retirement Account, or (z) a rollover to a tax qualified retirement plan of
Buyer or Buyer Bank to the extent the plan sponsored by Buyer or Buyer Bank
accepts rollover contributions, if such participant is employed by Buyer or
Buyer Bank.

(d) Company Employees who are retained by Buyer or Buyer Bank shall be
entitled to participate in Buyer Benefit Plans to the same extent as
similarly-situated employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank (it being understood that
inclusion of Company Employees in the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans). To the extent feasible
under any of such plans, Company Employees shall be given credit for prior
service or employment with Company or Company Bank and eligible for any
increased benefits under such plans that would apply to such employees as if
they had been eligible for such benefits as of the Effective Time, based on
the length of service or employment with Company or Company Bank. With regard
to insured Buyer Benefit Plans, applicable waiting periods may
apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may amend or terminate any Buyer
Benefit Plan at any time in its sole discretion.

(e) If employees of Company or any of its Subsidiaries become eligible to
participate in a medical, dental or health plan of Buyer or Buyer Bank upon
termination of such plan of Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such plan to (i) waive any
preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions are covered
under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of Buyer or Buyer Bank,
(ii) subject 

 



48  to approval from Buyers insurance carrier, provide full credit under such
plans for any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the calendar year
prior to such participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be applicable to
such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to the extent such
employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an
analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs.

 

(f) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.11,
Buyer shall honor, and Buyer shall be obligated to perform, all employment,
severance, deferred compensation, retirement or "change-in-control"
agreements, plans or policies of Company or Company Bank, but only if such
obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies are set forth in 
_Disclosure Schedule Section 5.11_. Buyer acknowledges that the consummation
of the Merger and Bank Merger will constitute a "change-in-control" of Company
and Company Bank for purposes of any benefit plans, agreements
and arrangements of Company and Company and Company Bank. Nothing herein
shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of
the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms at any time, subject to vested rights of employees and directors that
may not be terminated pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans.

(g) Nothing in this Section 5.11, expressed or implied, is intended to confer
upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision
of this Section 5.11 will create any third party beneficiary rights in any
current or former employee, director or consultant of Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any
other matter. Nothing in this Section 5.11 is intended (i) to amend any
Company Benefit Plan or any Buyer Benefit Plan, (ii) interfere with Buyers
right from and after the Closing Date to amend or terminate any Company
Benefit Plan that is not terminated prior to the Effective Time or Buyer
Benefit Plan, (iii) interfere with Buyers right from and after the Effective
Time to terminate the employment or provision of services by any director,
employee, independent contractor or consultant or (iv) interfere with Buyers
indemnification obligations set forth in Section 5.10.

Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Changes_. Buyer and Company shall
promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which could
reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
itself or any of its respective Subsidiaries or which it believes would, or
which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute a material breach
of any of its or its respective Subsidiaries representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time
(and on the date prior to the Closing Date), Company will supplement or amend
its Disclosure Schedules delivered in connection with the execution of this
Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in such Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially
inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to any Disclosure Schedule or
provision of information relating to the subject matter of any Disclosure
Schedule after the date of this Agreement shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
6.02(a) or Section 6.03(b) hereof, as the case may be, or compliance by Buyer
or Company with the respective covenants and agreements of such parties set
forth herein.

 



49 Section 5.13 _Current Information_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, each of Company and Buyer will cause one or
more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular and frequent
basis (not less than weekly) with representatives of the other party and to
report the general status of the ongoing operations of Company and its
Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without limiting
the foregoing, Company agrees to provide to Buyer (i) a copy of each report
filed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Authority
within one (1) Business Day following the filing thereof and (ii) by 10:00
a.m., Central Time, on each Business Day, a copy of Companys daily statement
of condition and daily profit and loss statement for the preceding Business
Day.

Section 5.14 _Board Packages_. Company shall distribute a copy of any Company
or Company Bank board package, including the agenda and any draft minutes, to
Buyer via secure email or similar electronic means at the same time in which
it distributes a copy of such package to the board of directors of Company or
Company Bank; provided, however, that Company shall not be required to copy
Buyer on any documents that disclose confidential discussions of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter that
Companys or Company Banks board of directors has been advised by counsel
that such distribution to Buyer may violate a confidentiality obligation or
fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or may result in a waiver of the
Companys attorney-client privilege.

 

Section 5.15 _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion_. From and after
the date hereof, Buyer and Company shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to facilitate the integration of Company with the business of Buyer
following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall meet
on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the
data processing and related electronic informational systems of Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (the "Informational Systems Conversion") to those
used by Buyer, which planning shall include, but not be limited to, (a)
discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of Company and each
of its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the Effective Time,
of personal property leases and software licenses used by Company and each of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the systems operations; (c) retention of
outside consultants and additional employees to assist with the conversion;
(d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the Effective Time, of proprietary or
self-provided system services; and (e) any other actions necessary and
appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time. Buyer shall promptly reimburse Company on request for any
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, expenses or charges that Company may incur as
a result of taking, at the request of Buyer, any action prior to the Effective
Time to facilitate the Informational Systems Conversion.

 

Section 5.16 _Access to Customers and Suppliers_. From and after the date
hereof, Company shall, upon Buyers reasonable request, introduce Buyer and
its representatives to suppliers of Company and its Subsidiaries for the
purpose of facilitating the integration of Company and its business into that
of Buyer. In addition, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.01(a) and Section 6.01(b), the Company shall, upon Buyers
reasonable request, introduce Buyer and its representatives to customers of
Company and its Subsidiaries for the purpose of facilitating the integration
of Company and its business into that of Buyer. Any interaction between Buyer
and Companys and any of its Subsidiaries customers and suppliers shall be
coordinated by Company. Company shall have the right to participate in any
discussions between Buyer and Companys customers and suppliers.

 



50 Section 5.17 _Environmental Assessments_.

 

(a) Upon Buyers request, and to the extent that Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not have reasonably current Phase I reports meeting the
standards described below already in its possession, Company shall cooperate
with and grant access to an environmental consulting firm selected and paid
for by Company and reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the
"Environmental Consultant"), during normal business hours (or at such other
times as may be agreed to by Company), to any property set forth on
_Disclosure Schedule Section 3.31,_ for the purpose of conducting an ASTM
Phase I, as it relates to providing an environmental site assessment to
determine whether any such property may be impacted by a "recognized
environmental condition," as that term is defined by ASTM. Each Phase I shall
be delivered in counterpart copies to Buyer and Company, and will include
customary language allowing both Buyer and Company to rely upon its findings
and conclusions. The Environmental Consultant will provide a draft of any
Phase I to Company and Buyer for review and comment prior to the finalization
of such report.

(b) To the extent the final version of any Phase I identifies any "recognized
environmental condition," Company shall cooperate with and grant access to
the Environmental Consultant, during normal business hours (or at such other
times as may be agreed by Company), to the property covered by such Phase I
for the purpose of conducting a Phase II limited site assessment, including
subsurface investigation of soil, soil vapor, and groundwater, designed to
further investigate and evaluate any "recognized environmental condition"
identified in the Phase I, the cost of which shall be shared equally between
Buyer and Company.

(c) Where any Phase I identifies the presence or potential presence of
radon, asbestos containing materials, mold, microbial matter, or
polychlorinated biphenyls ("Non-scope Issues"), Company shall cooperate with
and grant access to the Environmental Consultant, during normal business hours
(or at such other times as may be agreed by Company) to the property covered
by such Phase I, for the purpose of conducting surveys and sampling of indoor
air and building materials designed to investigate such identified Non-scope
Issue, paid for by Company.

 

(d) Any work conducted by the Environmental Consultant pursuant to subsections
(b) and (c) ("Additional Environmental Assessment") will be pursuant to a
scope of work prepared by the Environmental Consultant and reasonably
acceptable to Company and Buyer.

 

(e) The reports of any Additional Environmental Assessment will be given
directly to Buyer and to Company by the Environmental Consultant.

 

Section 5.18 _Certain Litigation_. In the event that any shareholder
litigation related to this Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to Companys Knowledge,
threatened, against Company and/or the members of the board of directors of
Company prior to the Effective Time, Company shall give Buyer the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of such litigation,
and no such settlement

 



51  shall be agreed to without Buyers prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld). Company shall promptly notify Buyer of any such
shareholder litigation brought, or threatened, against Company and/or members
of the board of directors of Company within one (1) Business Day after Company
receives notice of any such claim or threat, and shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed with respect to the status thereof.

reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer resignations of all the
directors of Company and its Subsidiaries, such resignations to be effective
as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.20 _Coordination_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Company and its Subsidiaries shall take any
actions Buyer may reasonably request from time to time to better prepare the
parties for integration of the operations of Company and Company Bank with
Buyer Bank. Without limiting the foregoing, senior officers of Company and
Buyer shall meet from time to time as Buyer may reasonably request, and in any
event not less frequently than monthly, to review the financial and
operational affairs of Company and its Subsidiaries, and Company shall give
due consideration to Buyers input on such matters, with the understanding
that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement,
neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank shall under any circumstance be permitted to

Company to facilitate integration of operations and assist with any other
coordination efforts as necessary.

(b) Upon Buyers reasonable request, prior to the Effective Time and
consistent with GAAP, the rules and regulations of the SEC and applicable
banking laws and regulations, each of Company and its Subsidiaries shall
modify or change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves) so as to be applied, on a basis that is consistent with
that of Buyer. In order to promote a more efficient and orderly integration
of operation of Company with Buyer Bank, from the date of execution of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, as more particularly set forth in
and subject to the provisions of Section 5.01(q), Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Company Bank to sell or
otherwise divest itself of such investment securities and loans as are
identified by Buyer and agreed to in writing between Company and Buyer from
time to time prior to the Closing Date, such identification to include a
statement as to Buyers business reasons for such divestitures.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such modifications, changes or divestitures
of the type described in this Section 5.20(b) need be made prior to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(a) and Section

(c) Company shall, consistent with GAAP and regulatory accounting principles,
use its commercially reasonable efforts to adjust, at Buyers reasonable
request, internal control procedures which are consistent with Buyers and
Buyer Banks current internal control procedures to allow Buyer to fulfill
its reporting requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
provided, however, that no such adjustments need be made prior to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 6.01(a) and Section
6.01(b).

 



52 (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Company and its Subsidiaries shall take any
actions Buyer may reasonably request in connection with negotiating any
amendments, modifications or terminations of any Leases or Material Contracts
that Buyer may request, including but not limited to, actions necessary to
cause any such amendments, modifications or terminations to become effective
prior to, or immediately upon, the Closing, and shall cooperate with Buyer and
use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate specific provisions that may
be requested by Buyer in connection with any such any amendment, modification
or termination.

(e) Subject to Section 5.20(b), Buyer and Company shall cooperate (i) to
minimize any potential adverse impact to Buyer under Financial Accounting
Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 (Business
Combinations), and (ii) to maximize potential benefits to the Buyer and its
Subsidiaries under Code Section 382 in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case consistent with GAAP, the rules
and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking laws and regulations.

 

(f) Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Non-
Compete Agreement to be executed and delivered at the Closing by
the individual identified on _Disclosure Schedule Section 8.01_.

(g) Buyer and Company agree to take all action necessary and appropriate to
cause Company Bank to merge with Buyer Bank in accordance with applicable Laws
and the terms of the Plan of Bank Merger as of the Effective Time, or such
later time, if any, as determined by Buyer.

 

Section 5.21 _Transactional Expenses_. Company has provided in _Disclosure
Schedule Section 3.36_ a reasonable good faith estimate of costs and fees
that Company and its Subsidiaries expect to pay to retained representatives in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
"Company Expenses"). Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the aggregate amount of all Company Expenses to not exceed the total
expenses disclosed in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.36_. Company shall
promptly notify Buyer if or when it determines that it expects to exceed its
budget for Company Expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.21, Company shall not incur any investment banking, brokerage,
finders or other similar financial advisory fees in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than those expressly set
forth in _Disclosure Schedule Section 3.36_.

 

Section 5.22 _Assumption by Buyer of Certain Obligations_. At or before the
Closing, Buyer shall deliver agreements or supplemental indentures as
required and in a form reasonably satisfactory to Company, as of the Effective
Time, in order to assume expressly the due and punctual performance and
observance of each and every covenant, agreement and condition (insofar as
such covenant, agreement or condition is to be performed and observed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries) of the indentures, trust agreements and
guarantee agreements entered into by Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
_Disclosure Schedule Section 5.22_ lists all of the indentures, trust
agreements and guarantee agreements entered into by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



53 Section 5.23 _Confidentiality_. In addition to the parties respective
obligations under the existing non-disclosure agreement previously entered
into between the parties or their duly authorized representatives, which
obligations are hereby reaffirmed and adopted, and incorporated by reference
herein, each party hereto shall, and shall cause its directors, Executive
Officers, advisers and agents to, maintain the confidentiality of all
confidential information, whether written or oral, furnished to it by the
other party concerning its and its Subsidiaries businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this Section 5.23, the term "confidential information" shall not
include any information that (i) at the time of disclosure or thereafter is
generally available to and known to the public, other than by a breach of this
Agreement by the disclosing party, (ii) was available to the disclosing
party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the non-disclosing
party or (iii) was independently acquired or developed without violating any
obligations of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.24 _Information Technology Agreement_. On or before April 12, 2014,

(d) _Breach of Representations and Warranties_. By either Buyer or Company

Companys or Company Banks material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement contemplated by Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e) that is not
timely cured as provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by
Buyer, including the expenses incurred by Buyer preparatory to entering into
this Agreement and in connection with the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement, would be significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged by
the circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is executed, and that

litigation proceedings in such event, the parties agree that Company shall pay
a reasonable estimate of the 

 



58  amount of such damages, which the parties agree is the sum of Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000) (the "Liquidated Damages Payment"), as liquidated
damages to Buyer, which payment is not intended as a penalty, within two (2)
Business Days after Buyers notification of such termination.

(c) Company and Buyer each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
under this Section 7.02, Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the
date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from
time to time in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or any successor
publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the date such
payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the costs and
expenses of Buyer (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to
Section 7.01(d), Section 7.01(e) or Section 7.01(g), and if Company pays or
causes to be paid to Buyer or to Buyer Bank the Termination Fee in accordance
with Section 7.02(a) or, if applicable, the Liquidated Damages Payment in
accordance with Section 7.02(b), Company (or any successor in interest of
Company) will not have any further obligations or liabilities to Buyer or
Buyer Bank with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

Section 7.03  _Effect of Termination_. Except as set forth in Section 7.02
Section 7.02(d), termination of this Agreement will not relieve a breaching
party from liability for any breach of any covenant, agreement, representation

similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder
does not, and the performance by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation or any
order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which Shareholder is a party
or by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute, rule or regulation to which

trustee that is the record holder of, and whose beneficiaries are the

commercially reasonable efforts to prohibit any of his, her or its

encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected

or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise
afford access, to any person (other than Buyer) any information or data with

Proposal.

 

Section 5\. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Subject to the last sentence of this Section

rights with respect to the Shares, to vote, if Shareholder is unable to
perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement, each of such Shares
that Shareholder shall be entitled to so vote with respect to the matters set
forth in Section 1 hereof at any meeting of the shareholders of Company, and
at any adjournment or postponement thereof, and in connection with any action
of the shareholders of Company taken by written consent. Shareholder intends
this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest hereafter until the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 7 hereof, and
hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by Shareholder with respect to the
Shares. This irrevocable proxy shall automatically terminate upon the
termination of this Agreement. 

Section 6\. _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys  Fees_. Shareholder
acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into
the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement and
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to Buyer if
Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by this Agreement
and that, in the event of any such failure, Buyer will not have an adequate
remedy at law or in equity. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that injunctive
relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any such
failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis that
Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that
Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with Buyers seeking or obtaining
such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with
Shareholder, Buyer shall have the right to inform any third party that Buyer
reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with
Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Buyer
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in
activities in violation of Shareholders agreement with Buyer set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by Buyer against such third party.

 

Section 7\. _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this Agreement shall
commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement
by the written agreement of the parties hereto, and shall be automatically
terminated upon termination of the Merger Agreement. Upon such termination,
no party shall have any further obligations or liabilities hereunder;
provided, however, that such termination shall not relieve any party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



A-3 Section 8\. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes all
