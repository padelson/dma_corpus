      Sellers by Third Parties, if any assignment or attempted assignment of the
      same without the consent of any Person, other than of the Seller or any of
      its Affiliates, would constitute a breach thereof, or if such Assumed
      Contract or license agreements for the Transferred Business Applications
      may not, by virtue of Law, be assigned or sublicensed and (the requirement
      for such consent is disclosed with respect to such Assumed Contract or

      reasonable efforts, and the Purchaser shall cooperate in all reasonable
      respects with the Seller, to obtain all consents and waivers and to
      resolve all impracticalities of assignments or transfers necessary to
      convey (or sublicense, in the case of Assumed Contracts, or license

      Assumed Contracts or Transferred Business Applications to be paid in
      connection with such assignment or sublicense, or provided to have been
      paid prior to the

      support for periods, or portions, therefore, ending before the
      applicable Closing Date). If any such Non-Assignable Assets are not able
      to be assigned or transferred (whether because a consent in respect of
      any Non-Assignable Assets could not be obtained or otherwise), (x) the

      financial or otherwise, other than provided above, to provide or cause
      to be provided to the Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable
      Law, the benefits of any such Non-Assignable Assets and cooperate with
      Purchaser or the applicable Designated Purchaser in any reasonable
      arrangement designed to provide Purchaser or the applicable Designated
      Purchaser the material benefits intended to be assigned under the
      relevant Asset, including enforcement at the cost and for the account of
      Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser of any and all rights of Seller or the
      applicable Designated Seller against the other party thereto arising out
      of the breach or cancellation thereof by such other party or otherwise;
      (y) the Seller shall (to the extent the Purchaser has undertaken the
      responsibilities thereunder) promptly pay or cause to be paid to the
      Purchaser all monies received by the Seller or any of its Affiliates with
      respect to any such Non-Assignable Asset; and (z) the Purchaser shall, to
      the extent the Seller or Seller's Affiliates are able to provide the
      benefits of such Non-Assignable Assets and comply with (y) above, perform
      and discharge on behalf of each of the Seller or any Designated Seller all
      of the Seller's or such Designated Seller's debts, liabilities,
      obligations or commitments, if any, thereunder, and subject to and in
      accordance with the provisions thereof.

      harmless from, the following obligations and liabilities, whether known or
      unknown, absolute, contingent, determined, determinable or otherwise, if
      the grounds or facts for such obligations and liabilities came into

      the case of Section 2.2(1)(a), whether accrued, presently in existence or
      arising hereafter) and were relating to or arising out of the applicable

      individually herein as the "FACILITY/DESIGN ASSUMED LIABILITIES" for each
      applicable Facility/ Design

            liabilities related to or arising from or in connection with: (A)
            the employment (or termination of employment) by the Purchaser or

            them) that arise or accrue on and after such Transferring Employees'
            Employment Transfer Date; (B) the Purchaser's or the relevant
            Designated Purchaser's Employment Offer, Quebec Employment Notice,

            rata based on the number of days that occur before and after such
            Closing, with such Taxes being borne by the Seller based on the
            ratio of the number of days in the relevant period prior to the
            relevant Closing Date to the total number of days in the actual
            taxable period with respect to which such Taxes are assessed,
            irrespective of when such Taxes are due, become a lien or are

            taxable period with respect to which such Taxes are assessed,
            irrespective of when such Taxes are due, become a lien or are
            assessed.

      Agreement or any other Transaction Document to the contrary, the Assumed
      Liabilities

                                                                  Execution Copy

      and

(j)   any liabilities or obligations of the Seller or Designated Sellers
      relating primarily to, or arising under, the Excluded Assets.

expressly indemnified by either Party, elsewhere in this Agreement.

SECTION 2.3 PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES

(1)   In full consideration for the transfer of the Facility/ Design Assets for
      each Facility or for the Design Operations, as the case may be, on the
      terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the Local Sale
      Agreement at each Facility/ Design Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
      relevant Designated Purchaser to assume, the Facility/ Design Assumed
      Liabilities, attributable to such Closing and pay, or cause to be paid on
      behalf of the Designated Purchaser, to the Seller or the relevant
      Designated Seller, at such Closing, an amount equal to the estimated
      Facility/ Design Estimated Net Assets Value as of the Reference Date
      referred to in the Facility/ Design Net Asset Statement (the "FACILITY/
      DESIGN ESTIMATED NET ASSETS VALUE") together with the additional purchase
      price set forth in Schedule 1.1 with respect to such Designated Purchaser.
      No more than ten (10) nor less than seven (7) Business Days prior to each
      Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (the
      "FACILITY/DESIGN NET ASSET STATEMENT"), executed on behalf of Seller,
      setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of the Facility/ Design
      Estimated Net Assets Value in respect of the Assets that are the subject
      of such Closing, which shall be accompanied by the applicable schedules of
      the relevant Facility/ Design Assets and Facility/ Design Assumed
      Liabilities. The Facility/ Design Estimated Net Assets Value together with
      the additional purchase price of two hundred million dollars
      ($200,000,000) as set forth in Schedule 1.1 with respect to such
      Designated Purchaser for such Closing, shall be referred to herein as the
      "FACILITY/ DESIGN PURCHASE PRICE". The sum of Facility/ Design Purchase
      Prices for all Facilities and the Design Operations, less the sum of
      Facility/ Design Purchase Prices in respect of Facility/ Design Closings
      which have not occurred by the date specified in Section 9.2(4), shall be
      referred to herein as the "PURCHASE PRICE".

(2)   The Parties have agreed as of the date hereof to certain advanced cash
      payments between the Parties related to the amounts payable pursuant to
      the terms of this Agreement (the "CASH FLOW PAYMENTS") as set forth in
      Schedule 2.3(2). The Parties acknowledge that the Cash Flow Payments
      strictly relate

                                                                  Execution Copy

      to optimization of each Parties cash management objectives in relation to
      the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and do not represent
      agreement between the Parties as to the amount of any additional
      purchase price payable in relation to any of the Facility/Design
      Closings. As such, the Parties agree that the Cash Flow Payments may
      represent an advance or instalment of the two hundred million dollars
      ($200,000,000) referenced in Section 2.3(1).

(3)   Subject to the provisions of Section 2.3(2), at each Facility/Design
      Closing, the relevant Designated Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer, to
      the Seller or applicable Designated Seller as the case may be, an amount
      equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of (i) the applicable Facility/Design
      Estimated Net Assets Value, plus (ii) the applicable Cash Flow Payment
      Amount referenced for such Facility/Design Closing in Schedule 2.3(2)
      (collectively the "INITIAL PAYMENT"). Thereafter, subject to appropriate
      adjustments to the Facility/Design Purchase Price for each Facility/Design
      Closing pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.4, Section 7.2 and Section
      7.3, the Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller (which
      Seller will accept on behalf of itself and/or the relevant Designated
      Seller) the amount of (i) the applicable Facility/Design Estimated Net
      Assets Value, plus (ii) the applicable Cash Flow Payment Amount referenced
      for such Facility/Design Closing in Schedule 2.3(2), less the Initial
      Payment (the "REMAINING CLOSING AMOUNT") in three (3) equal instalments
      according to the following payment schedule:

      shall be one-third (1/3) of the (i) the applicable Facility/Design
      Estimated Net Assets Value, plus (ii) the applicable Cash Flow Payment
      Amount referenced for such Facility/Design Closing in Schedule 2.3(2),
      and the Remaining Closing Amount shall be paid in two (2) equal

      The obligation to pay each Remaining Closing Amount in respect of each
      Facility/Design Closing shall be evidenced by a Promissory Note.

      All payments made pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall be made in the
      currency referenced in the applicable VSHA, or otherwise in United
      States dollars.

      Notwithstanding the above, the amount of each outstanding quarterly
      payment for each Facility/Design Closing will be adjusted up or down, as
      the case may be, to reflect any adjustments to the Facility/Design
      Purchase Price, if any, required pursuant to the provisions of Section
      2.4, Section 7.2 and Section 7.3 of this Agreement.

(4)   Allocation of Purchase Price.

      (a)   The Seller and the Purchaser have allocated on a preliminary basis,
            each Facility/Design Purchase Price, for each Facility and the
            Design Operations as set forth in Schedule 1.1.

      (b)   Such allocations shall be finalized, in accordance with the
            preliminary allocations methodology, as promptly as practicable
            following the last Closing Date, but in any event not later than
            ten (10) Business Days following the final determination of the
            Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4.

      (c)   The Seller and the Purchaser hereby agree to execute and file or
            cause to be executed and filed all relevant Tax Returns and prepare
            or cause to be prepared all financial statements, returns and other
            instruments on the basis of the allocations referred to in Section
            2.3(1). None of the Seller, the Designated Sellers, the Purchasers
            or the Designated Purchasers shall take any position on any Tax
            Return, before any Government Entity charged with the collection of
            any Tax, or in any judicial proceeding that is inconsistent with
            the allocation of the Purchase Price established pursuant to Section
            2.3(1).

      (d)   Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither the
            Purchaser nor any of the Designated Purchasers, nor the Seller nor
            any of the Designated Sellers, if applicable, shall be responsible
            for any Tax liability or any other expense of, in the case of the
            Purchaser or any Designated Purchasers, the Seller or any Designated
            Seller and, in the case of the Seller or any Designated Seller, the
            Purchaser or any

                                                                  Execution Copy

            Designated Purchaser, resulting from the reporting and allocations
            made by such Party as contemplated by Section 2.3(1).

SECTION 2.4 ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE.

(1)   Physical Count and Inspection. Within seven (7) calendar days before each
      Facility/ Design Closing, the Seller or Designated Seller, as the case may
      be, shall take a physical count and inspection of the Facility/ Design
      Assets, as of the Effective Date in accordance with a mutually agreed
      upon procedure for conducting such physical count and inspection, to
      confirm the amount of each item of Facility/ Design Assets and their
      conformity to any criteria set forth in this Agreement. Representatives of
      the Purchaser or the Designated Purchaser, as the case may be, will be
      entitled to participate in all aspects of such physical count and
      inspection. The Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities shall, in
      respect of the Aggregate Asset Amount, reflect the results of each of the
      physical counts of the Assets in respect of each Facility and the Design
      Operations, as the case may be, as contemplated in this Section 2.4(1).

(2)   Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Within sixty (60) days
      following the Closing Date for each Facility/ Design Closing, the Seller
      shall prepare and submit to the Purchaser in accordance with the form set
      out in Schedule 1.1 a final statement of the Facility/ Design Estimated
      Net Asset Value, including Assets acquired, and Assumed Liabilities
      assumed, at such Closing as at the applicable Closing Date (the "CLOSING
      STATEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES"), which shall contain specific lists
      of Assets and Assumed Liabilities and shall be prepared (i) from the books
      and records maintained by the Seller or the Designated Sellers, as the
      case may be, in connection with the Operations (to the extent consistent
      with clauses (ii) and (iii) below ); (ii) reflecting the results of the
      physical inspections contemplated by Section 2.4(1) and any variances
      therein from the information set forth in the Facility/ Design Net Asset
      Statement, and (iii) in accordance with the definitions, guidelines and
      assumptions set forth in Section 1.1(79), this Section 2.4(2) and
      elsewhere in this Agreement. The Closing Statement of Assets and
      Liabilities shall fairly present the aggregate Facility/ Design Closing
      Net Assets Value in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Provided
      the Closing Statement of Assets conforms to the requirements set forth in
      Section 1.1(79), the preparation and examination of the Closing Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities is not intended to permit the introduction of
      different judgments, accounting methods, policies, practices, procedures,
      classifications or estimation methodology for purposes of determining the
      asset and liability balances from those used in the Facility/ Design Net
      Asset Statement. Each Party shall provide the other Party and its

                                                                  Execution Copy

      Assets and Liabilities and the resolution of any disputes that may arise
      under this Section 2.4.

(3)   Review of the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The Purchaser
      and its representatives shall have sixty (60) days following receipt of
      the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities in which to review and
      examine the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities and all accounting
      procedures, books, records and work papers used in the preparation of the
      Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities and to verify the accuracy,
      presentation and other matters related to the preparation of the Closing
      Statement of Assets and Liabilities and the conformity of the Facility/
      Design Estimated Net Assets Value to the terms of Section 1.1(79). If the
      Purchaser determines that the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities
      (a) does not fairly present any items on such Closing Statement of Assets
      and Liabilities or reflects a value for any assets or liabilities that
      does not conform to the terms of Section 1.1(79) or includes any Excluded
      Assets or Excluded Liabilities, or excludes any Assets or Assumed
      Liabilities, the Purchaser shall have the right to propose any adjustment
      thereto within such sixty (60) day period. Any such proposed adjustment
      (an "ADJUSTMENT REQUEST") shall be submitted by the Purchaser to the
      Seller within such sixty (60) day period and shall specify (i) the
      amount(s) of the Adjustment Request; (ii) the item(s) to which such
      Adjustment Request relates; and (iii) the facts and circum stances
      supporting such Adjustment Request. Subject to any intentional
      misrepresentation and/or fraud, unless the Purchaser notifies the
      Seller within such sixty (60) day period that it objects to the Closing
      Statement of Assets and Liabilities, such Closing Statement of Assets and
      Liabilities shall be binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser. After the
      end of such sixty (60) day period, the Purchaser may not introduce
      additional disagreements with respect to any item in the Closing Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities or increase the amount of any disagreement, and
      any item not so identified shall be deemed to be agreed to by the
      Purchaser and will be final and binding upon the Parties. Similarly, a
      disagreement by the Purchaser does not provide any right to the Seller to
      introduce any changes to the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities
      not directly related to the disputed item. To the extent that a
      disagreement relates to an error in the Closing Statement of Assets and
      Liabilities and a similar error also exists in the Facility/Design Net
      Asset Statement, then, to the extent that such disagreement is determined
      to be an error, the error in the Closing Statement of Assets and
      Liabilities and the error in the Facility/Design Net Asset Statement
      shall both be corrected in determining the adjustment under Section
      2.4(4). The Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially
      reasonable efforts for forty-five (45) Business Days following the
      Seller's receipt of any Adjustment Request to agree upon any proposed
      adjustments to the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities

                                                                  Execution Copy

      at issue. If the Purchaser and the Seller, each acting reasonably and in
      good faith, are unable to resolve all disagreements properly identified by
      the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 2.4(3) within such period, then the
      disputed matters shall be submitted to a mutually agreed upon expert from
      one of the nationally recognized firms of certified public accountants in
      the United States of America that is not the independent auditor of either
      Party (the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT") for resolution. The Independent
      Accountant will only consider those items and amounts set forth in the
      Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities as to which the Purchaser and
      the Seller have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms
      specified above, and must resolve the matter in accordance with the terms
      and provisions of this Agreement. The Independent Accountant shall deliver
      to the Purchaser and the Seller, as promptly as practicable and in any
      event within one hundred and twenty (120) days after its appointment, a
      written report setting forth the resolution of any such disagreement
      determined in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The Independent
      Accountant shall select as a resolution the position of either the
      Purchaser or the Seller for each item of disagreement (based solely on
      presentations and supporting material provided by the Parties and not
      pursuant to any independent review) and may not impose an alternative
      resolution. The Independent Accountant's determination shall be final and
      binding on the parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent
      Accountant relating to this Section 2.4(3) shall be paid as set forth in
      Section 9.27.

(4)   Adjustment and Payment Procedures. If the Facility/Design Closing Net
      Assets Value set forth on the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities,
      as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4(3), exceeds the
      Facility/Design Estimated Net Assets Value, the Purchase Price shall be
      increased dollar for dollar by the amount of such excess and the Purchaser
      shall pay (as noted below in this Section 2.4(4)) to the Seller on behalf
      of itself and any applicable Designated Sellers the amount of such excess.
      If the value of the Facility/Design Closing Net Assets Value set forth on
      the Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities, as finally determined
      pursuant to Section 2.4(3), is less than the Estimated Net Assets Value,
      the Purchase Price shall be decreased dollar for dollar by the amount of
      such deficit and the Seller shall pay (as noted below in this Section
      2.4(4)) to the Purchaser the amount of such deficit. Once determination of
      the Facility/Design Closing Net Assets Value is deemed final in accordance
      with Section 2.4(3), any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 2.4(4)
      shall be made by adjusting the outstanding quarterly payment amounts of
      the Purchase Price, if any, owing to the Seller pursuant to the provision
      of Section 2.3. If no amounts remain owing pursuant to the provisions of
      Section 2.3, such amount shall be paid forthwith by the applicable Party
      to the other by wire transfer.

                                                                  Execution Copy

SECTION 2.6 PERSONAL COMPUTERS

(1)   Seller or the Designated Seller lease certain of the PCs and ancillary
      equipment used by the Employees in the Operations (collectively, the
      "LEASED PC EQUIPMENT"). The Parties agree that these PCs and ancillary
      equipment are not intended to form part of the Facility/Design Assets.
      The temporary use by the Purchaser and the Designated Purchaser, as the
      case may be, following the applicable Closing Date of Leased PC Equipment
      shall be governed by the Shared Services Agreement.

                                                                  Execution Copy

(2)   The Parties acknowledge the Purchaser and its Affiliates may, but shall
      not be obligated to, contract with the lessors of such Leased PC Equipment
      for the purchase or continued use of such equipment following the expiry
      of the Shared Services Agreement.

(3)   Schedule 2.6 lists and separately identifies each piece of Leased PC
      Equipment used in the Operations. No later than (30) days prior to the
      termination of the applicable "SSA Period" (as that term is defined in the
      Shared Services Agreement), the Purchaser shall be entitled to request
      that (i) Seller approach the lessor(s) and negotiate on behalf of
      Purchaser or a Designated Purchaser, either a buyout of such equipment (in
      which case such equipment shall be deemed to Owned Equipment and
      transferred pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as part of the
      transfer of the Facility/Design Assets for the applicable Facility or the
      Design Operations, as the case may be); or (ii) the assignment in whole or
      in part, and assumption by the Purchaser of the applicable lease
      agreements, in which case Seller or the applicable Designated Seller shall
      use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve either (i) or (ii) above,
      as requested by Purchaser, and in the case of clause (i) shall make any
      buy-out payments required under the terms of the applicable lease to be
      provided to any applicable lessor. In respect of the Leased PC Equipment
      listed on Schedule 2.6 for which title or the lease in respect thereof is
      to be transferred, when and if the Seller is able to transfer, or to cause
      to be transferred, title to such equipment or the lease in respect thereof
      to the Purchaser or the relevant Designated Purchasers, the Seller will
      notify the Purchaser of the proposed transfer date (the "TRANSFER DATE" )
      and the value (the "TRANSFER VALUE" ) in the case of a buyout of Leased PC
      Equipment so being transferred (which amount will be provided by the
      lessor of such equipment). Upon receipt of such notification, the
      Purchaser or relevant Designated Purchasers shall promptly advise the
      Seller whether it wishes to buy out the Leased PC Equipment and, if it
      wishes to make such a buy out, upon receipt of a bill of sale from the
      Seller evidencing transfer of title of such Leased PC Equipment, the
      Purchaser agrees to pay to the Seller as agent for the relevant Designated
      Seller on the relevant Transfer Date, (in immediately available funds in
      the currency of the applicable equipment contract), the Transfer Value of
      the Leased PC Equipment being transferred (and any applicable Transfer
      Taxes arising out of either the purchase of Leased PC Equipment by the
      Seller or any of its Affiliates or out of the transfer of such Leased PC
      Equipment to the Purchaser or the relevant Designated Purchaser hereunder)

terminations and labour relations matters in relation to the portion of the
Operations that remains to be transferred to Purchaser as of such date, or any

during normal business hours to the Facility/ Design Assets for the purpose of
conducting such inspections and performing such investigations as the Purchaser

reasonably request in its review of the properties, assets and business affairs
of the Operations and the above-mentioned documents, records and information.
All information that is made available, disclosed or provided to the Purchaser
and its representatives shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Purchaser shall conduct any inquiries pursuant to

any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice, plan,
occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction, with
respect to the Seller or any of its Affiliates on or prior to the applicable

participation, all at the sole cost and expense of the Primary Party so
contesting, defending or participating; provided, however, that such
assistance does not prejudice any rights of the assisting Party, and provided,
further, that the foregoing provisions in this Section 5.4 shall not apply if
the Primary Party contesting, defending or participating is entitled to ind-
emnification therefore under Article 7, in which case such article shall
govern.

      Operations. The Purchaser shall maintain and preserve all such books, and
      records and other documents for the longer of (x) four (4) years from
      the relevant Closing Date, or (y) any applicable statutory or regulatory
      retention period, as the same may be extended, or any applicable
      limitation period .

(2)   Seller's Obligations. From and after each applicable Closing Date, as
      permitted by Law but subject to applicable attorney-client privilege, the
      Seller shall make or cause to be made available to the Purchaser for
      inspection all books, records and documents in the possession of the
      Seller or the applicable Designated Seller relating exclusively to or used
      exclusively in the Operations or the Facility/ Design Operations,
      respectively, or to the Assets, Assumed Liabilities and the Transferring
      Employees at issue prior to the relevant Closing Date (and the reasonable

      responsible for such books, records and documents) for the purposes of (i)
      investigating, preparing for the defence or prosecution of, prosecuting or

      (x) four (4) years from the relevant Closing Date, or (y) any applicable
      statutory or regulatory retention period, as the same may be extended, or
      any applicable limitation period. The Seller shall take such action as may
      be necessary to make any audit workpapers of its auditors relating to the
      Operations and the Assets available to the Purchaser and its auditors, to
      the extent such material is reasonably

                                                                  Execution Copy

         privilege, Seller agrees to provide the Purchaser (at the Purchaser's

         extent reasonable and customary, and to its independent accountants, in
         order to assist the Purchaser with its regulatory filings; provided,
         however, that such access shall not be unduly burdensome to the Seller
         or its Affiliates or shall not unduly disrupt the Seller's or its
         Affiliates' ongoing business or financial reporting obligations.

         the amounts paid at the Closing will be subsequently adjusted to take
         into account the final purchase price allocation pursuant to Section
         2.3 or after a taxing authority has finally determined the amount of
         Taxes to be paid. Any Tax amounts due and owing in connection with the
         final purchase price allocation or pursuant to the final determination

         for the purposes hereof, the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser will be
         solely responsible for ensuring that any such exemption applies and, in

         number and the applicable certificate of exemption or election form
         under such law to support the Purchaser's or Designated Purchaser's
         claim to entitlement to such exemption or election. The Seller or
         Designated Seller will cooperate with the Purchaser or Designated
         Purchaser in its claiming of any such exemption, provided such
         exemption or election is lawful and appropriate under the local tax
         legislation. The Purchaser and such Designated Purchaser shall
         indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and the applicable Designated
         Seller for the Purchaser's and such Designated Purchaser's allocable
         share of the Transfer Taxes pursuant to this Section, interest,
         penalties and Damages relating to Transfer Taxes (including legal,

         Purchaser, any such Transfer Tax at the applicable Closing and the
         Purchaser's and such Designated Purchaser's claimed entitlement to an
         exemption or election is subsequently disallowed or not accepted by the
         relevant authorities.

(8)      Each of the Purchaser and the Designated Purchaser, the Seller and the
         Designated Seller shall, if applicable, register on or before Closing

Purchaser has received certain estimates, projections and other forecasts for
the Operations, and certain plan and budget information (collectively, or

there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets and that the Purchaser is familiar
with such uncertainties. The Seller makes no representation or warranty in any
Transaction Document herein with respect to any Forward Looking Information

                  Contracts and license agreements for the Transferred
                  Applications that are required under the terms thereof in
                  order to assign the same to the Purchaser or the applicable
                  Designated Purchaser (collectively, the " NECESSARY

         (ii)     comply with applicable Law to commence and pursue diligently
                  such information and consultation process and procedures with

         reasonable efforts to transfer and assign such software application and
         any license agreements related thereto to Purchaser.

(d)      Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.1(3) of this Agreement to the
         contrary, in the event that obtaining consent to assignment of a
         license agreement for a Transferred Business Application would require
         Seller or any Designated Seller or Purchaser or Designated Purchaser to
         pay money to a Third Party, including any requirement by a licensor
         that the Seller or Designated Seller make any payments for maintenance

         good faith to negotiate the amount of such payments and each Party will
         pay either (i) fifty percent (50%) of such amount in order to obtain
         such consent provided that such payment need not be made if the amount
         is unreasonable compared to the cost of obtaining a new license or

                                                                  Execution Copy

                  (ii) fifty percent (50%) of costs incurred to obtain
                  comparable software licences if consent cannot be obtained or
                  the cost of obtaining consent is unreasonable compared to the

SECTION 5.12 COOPERATION

(1)      The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in commercially reasonable
         fashion with each other and shall cause the Designated Purchasers and
         the Designated Sellers and their respective officers, employees, agents
         and representatives to cooperate with each other following each Closing
         Date to provide for an orderly transition of the Transferring
         Employees, the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities to the Purchaser and
         the Designated Purchasers. Save and except for the Transition Payment,
         each Party shall bear its own out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
         in assisting the other pursuant to this Section 5.11. No Party shall be
         required by this Section 5.11 to take any action that would
         unreasonably interfere with the conduct of its business.

(2)      Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement and provided it does
         not interfere with the Seller's, commercial interests or require any
         payments to any Third Parties, the Seller will provide for a reasonable
         period of time after the date of this Agreement, reasonable assistance

         such party prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.13 PURCHASER'S ACQUISITION OF SOFTWARE

         The Purchaser acknowledges that, except for the Single Use Desktop
Software and the Transferred Business Applications licensed from Third Parties
which are to be assigned to the Purchaser or Designated Purchasers as set forth
in Schedule 1.1(118), it is not acquiring any right, title or interest in
software contained in any computer equipment, which may form part of the Assets.
Subject to the provisions of the Shared Services Agreement, if such a license is
required to use any Third Party software so contained and the Purchaser is not
able to renew or obtain its own

                                                                  Execution Copy

license for such software, the Purchaser agrees to remove such software from
any computer equipment forming part of the Assets no later than sixty (60) days

SECTION 5.14 TRANSFERABLE EQUIPMENT

(1)      Except to the extent described in Section 2.6 and the remainder of
         this Section 5.14, Seller does not intend to purchase, or cause to be
         purchased , any of the Leased Equipment out of lease or to convey, or
         cause to be conveyed , title to such Leased Equipment to Purchaser or
         the Designated Purchasers on a country by country basis as part of the
         transfer of the Facility/ Design Assets for each Facility or the Design
         Operations, as applicable. Subject to the buyout provision in Section
         5.14(2), the Parties agree that the Leased Equipment (as opposed to the
         leasehold rights related thereto) itself is not intended to form part
         of the Facility/ Design Assets for such Facility or Design Operations,
         as applicable, hereunder. The Seller's inability to transfer, or to
         cause to be transferred, title to any of the Leased Equipment for any
         particular Facility or the Design Operations, as applicable, as at the
         relevant Effective Time shall not be considered to constitute a
         Material Adverse Effect.

(2)      If any of the Leased Equipment shall not have been transferred to the
         Purchaser or the Designated Purchaser within forty-five (45) days after
         the relevant Closing Date (" TRANSFERABLE EQUIPMENT" ), then the Seller
         or the Designated Seller, as the case may be, shall promptly initiate
         the buy-out provisions under the relevant lease agreement in order to
         transfer, or to cause to be transferred , title to the Transferable
         Equipment to the Purchaser or the relevant Designated Purchasers within
         the next forty-five (45) days. The Seller will notify the Purchaser
         of the proposed transfer date (the "TRANSFERABLE EQUIPMENT TRANSFER
         DATE" ) and a proposed determination of the fair market value thereof
         for each piece of Transferable Equipment so being transferred. In the
         event that the Purchaser does not agree with Seller's proposed fair
         market value, Purchaser shall so notify Seller and Purchaser and Seller
         shall use commercially reasonable effects to agree on such fair market
         value, and if the parties are not able to so agree, then the fair
         market value shall be determined by the Independent Accountant pursuant
         to Section 2.4(3) (the " TRANSFERABLE EQUIPMENT TRANSFER VALUE" ). Upon
         receipt of a bill of sale from the Seller evidencing transfer of title
         of the Transferable Equipment, the Purchaser agrees to pay to the
         Seller on the relevant Transferable Equipment Transfer Date, in
         immediately available US dollar funds, the fair market value (and
         applicable Transfer Taxes in accordance with Section 5.6 arising out of
         either the purchase of such Transferable Equipment by the Seller or any
         of its Affiliates or out of the transfer of such Transferable Equipment
         to the Purchaser or the relevant Designated Purchaser hereunder). The
         Seller's ability to only recoup from the Purchaser

                                                                  Execution Copy
<PAGE>

                                           - 79 -

         the Transferable Equipment Transfer Value Portion of any payment to the
         applicable lessor (and not to recoup from the Purchaser the full buyout
         payment) pursuant to this Section 5.14(2) is limited only so long as,
         (i) the Purchaser meets the applicable lessor's standard of
         creditworthiness for its lessees, and (ii) any applicable lessor
         contractual limitations regarding asset movement outside of North
         America (i.e., Canada, the United States and Mexico). Once transferred,
         the Transferable Equipment shall be deemed by the parties to this
         Agreement to be included with the Owned Equipment and transferred
         pursuant to the terms of this Agreement as part of the transfer of the
         Facility/Design Assets for each Facility.

(3)      Any temporary use of the Transferable Equipment by the Purchaser and
         the Designated Purchaser, as the case may be, following the applicable
         Closing Date and pending the Transferable Equipment Transfer Date shall
         be governed by the Shared Services Agreement.

SECTION 5.15 INVENTORY PUT OPTION

(1)      The Purchaser and the Designated Purchasers shall have the following
         options to sell to the Seller or the Designated Sellers:

         (a)      all Unused Inventory (the "INVENTORY PUT OPTION" );

         (b)      all Unused Unassigned Finished Goods Inventory (the
                  "UNASSIGNED FINISHED GOODS PUT OPTION" ); and

         (c)      all Unrepairable Bonepile Inventory (the "BONEPILE INVENTORY
                  PUT OPTION").

(2)      Notwithstanding the foregoing:

         (a)      Unused Inventory and the Unused Unassigned Finished Goods
                  Inventory shall be deemed to be reduced by (i) the amount of
                  inventory, if any, of the same kind, or suitable for the same
                  purpose, that is acquired for use by the same Facility (after
                  the applicable Closing) and sold to Seller or Designated
                  Seller during the applicable put period, and (ii) the amount
                  of inventory, if any, of the same kind, or suitable for the
                  same purpose, that is acquired (other than from the same
                  Facility and after the applicable Closing) for use by another
                  facility to which manufacturing is transferred or has been
                  transferred in whole or in part;

         (b)      components that are Inventory and subsequently revealed during
                  the Inventory Put Period to have shelf life that has expired
                  as at the applicable Closing Date, or which have a date code
                  expiring during the

                                                                  Execution Copy

                  Inventory Put Period, shall be reported to the Seller or
                  Designated Seller as soon as reasonably practicable following
                  discovery. Seller or Designated Seller shall either, (i) pay
                  the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser to rework such
                  components in an amount equal to their costs incurred in
                  reworking, (ii) repurchase as soon as reasonably possible such
                  components for the price paid by the Purchaser or Designated
                  Purchaser for such components, or (iii) authorize their use in
                  the Products (provided that to the extent such components
                  are authorized for use in the Products, the Seller or
                  Designated Seller waives any indemnification or warranty
                  rights it may have against the Purchaser or Designated
                  Purchaser in relation to the usage of such components), with
                  respect to the specific condition waived, and the Seller or
                  Designated Seller shall be entitled to select the applicable
                  clause of this sentence that shall apply; and

         (c)      components that are Inventory and have a shelf life that
                  expires prior to the end of the applicable Put Period and
                  because of such expired shelf life cannot be consumed within
                  the Put Period in the ordinary course of business, shall be
                  reported to the Seller or Designated Seller as soon as
                  reasonably practicable following discovery. Seller or
                  Designated Seller shall either (i) pay the Purchaser or
                  Designated Purchaser to rework such components in an amount
                  equal to their costs incurred in reworking, (ii) repurchase
                  such components for the price paid by the Purchaser or
                  Designated Purchaser for such components, or (iii) authorize
                  their use in the Products (provided that to the extent such
                  components are authorized for use in the Products, the
                  Seller or Designated Seller waives any indemnification or
                  warranty rights it may have against the Purchaser or
                  Designated Purchaser in relation to the usage of such
                  components with respect to the specific condition waived,
                  and the Seller or Designated Seller shall be entitled to
                  select the applicable clause of this sentence that shall
                  apply). Not withstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser or
                  Designated Purchaser shall use or be deemed to have used such
                  components, assuming they have a useable shelf life, prior to
                  components of the same kind, or suitable for the same
                  purpose, that are acquired by the Purchaser or Designated
                  Purchaser from other than the Seller or Designated Seller.

         (d)      At the end of the Inventory Put Period, if the Purchaser or
                  Designated Purchaser physically holds Unused Inventory that
                  has been used, transformed, or otherwise consumed, but has
                  not been sold to the Seller or Designated Seller and cannot be
                  sold to the Seller or Designated Seller in its original state,
                  the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser shall have the right to
                  deem a piece of inventory of the same

                                                                  Execution Copy

                  kind, or suitable for the same purpose, and equivalent value
                  to be Unused Inventory and can be sold back to the Seller or
                  Designated Seller in place of the original Unused Inventory
                  item.

         (e)      At the end of the Unassigned Finished Goods Put Period, if
                  the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser physically holds Unused
                  Unassigned Finished Goods Inventory that has been used,
                  transformed, or otherwise consumed, but has not been sold to
                  the Seller or Designated Seller and cannot be sold to the
                  Seller or Designated Seller in its original state, the
                  Purchaser or Designated Purchaser shall have the right to deem
                  a piece of inventory of the same kind, or suitable for the
                  same purpose, and equivalent value to be Unused Unassigned
                  Finished Goods Inventory and can be sold back to the Seller
                  or Designated Seller in place of the original Unused
                  Unassigned Finished Goods Inventory item.

(3)      The applicable put option may be exercised by the Purchaser within
         ninety (90) days after the expiration of the applicable Inventory Put
         Period, Unassigned Finished Goods Put Period, or Bonepile Inventory
         Put Period, as the case may be, by sending a notice in writing to
         the Seller specifying (i) the identity of the Unused Inventory, Unused
         Unassigned Finished Goods, or Unrepairable Bonepile Inventory; (ii)
         the quantity of the Unused Inventory, Unused Unassigned Finished Good s
         or Unrepairable Bonepile Inventory; and (iii) the original purchase
         price for the Unused Inventory, Unused Unassigned Finished Goods or
         Unrepairable Bonepile Inventory paid pursuant to this Agreement
         (individually, or collectively, the "INVENTORY PUT PURCHASE PRICE" )
         and (iv) that the Unused Inventory, Unused Unassigned Finished Goods or
         Unrepairable Bonepile Inventory, has been calculated and determined in
         accordance with Section 5.14(1) above. The Seller shall have ten (10)
         Business Days within which to discuss with the Purchaser and the
         Purchaser shall make itself available to discuss with the Seller any
         questions or outstanding issues with respect to the Purchaser's
         exercise of the applicable put option. The Seller shall either (i) pay,
         or cause the applicable Designated Seller to pay, to the Purchaser the
         Inventory Put Purchase Price, within thirty (30) Business Days of
         receipt of each notice of exercise of the applicable put option, or
         (ii) send a written notice to the Purchaser within twenty (20) Business
         Days of receipt of each notice of exercise of the applicable put option
         that it objects to the calculation of the Inventory Put Purchase Price,
         failing which the Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the Inventory
         Put Purchase Price calculation. Any such written notice of objection
         from the Seller must state (a) the specific items of Unused Inventory,
         Unused Unassigned Finished Goods or Unrepairable Bonepile Inventory,
         which the Seller contends should not be repurchased, and (b) the

                                                                  Execution Copy

                                     - 82 -

         basis for its position with respect to each of such items of Unused
         Inventory, Unused Unassigned Finished Goods or Unrepairable Bonepile
         Inventory, which will be limited to mathematical errors or matters
         of the nature described in Section 5.14(1) and Section 5.14(2) above.
         In addition, any such written notice of objection must be accompanied
         within ten (10) Business Days by payment in full for the items of
         Unused Inventory, Unused Unassigned Finished Goods or Unrepairable
         Bonepile Inventory which are not subject to such written notice of
         objection.

(4)      If the Seller objects to the Inventory Put Purchase Price calculation
         pursuant to Section 5.15(3) above then either the Seller or the
         Purchaser may refer the matter in writing to the Independent
         Accountant, who will promptly resolve the issue after discussions with
         each of the Seller and the Purchaser and in consideration of the
         concerns of each of the Seller and the Purchaser, and will prepare an
         Inventory Put Purchase Price schedule which shall be final and binding
         on the Seller and the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates. The
         Seller shall pay, or cause the applicable Designated Seller to pay, to
         the Purchaser the balance of the Inventory Put Purchase Price
         determined by the Independent Accountant (in his capacity as an expert)
         within ten (10) Business Days of any such determination, together with
         interest thereon at a rate equal to six percent (6%) per annum,
         calculated from the last date notice of objection was due pursuant
         to Section 5.15(3) above.

(5)      The foregoing provisions of this Section 5.15 shall not apply to End of
         Life Inventory or Repair Inventory which shall be dealt with in
         accordance with the terms and conditions of the Amended and
         Restated Master Contract Manufacturing Services Agreement and the
         Repair Services Agreement.

(6)      The Purchaser shall provide to the Seller commencing from the first
         Closing Date until the end of the Inventory Put Period, monthly
         reports (by part number of the unit quantity and the dollar amount)
         of the Inventory consumed and Unused Inventory, Bonepile Inventory, and
         Unassigned Finished Goods remaining at such month end in each
         Facility. In addition, the Purchaser shall provide, for each
         Facility and for each facility to which the Purchaser or a Designated
         Purchaser has transferred Products during the Inventory Put Period,
         at the end of the applicable put period a list of all inventory of
         the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser of the same kinds as the
         Inventory (by a format similar to Schedule 1.1(113)). At any time
         prior to exercising the applicable put option, if the Purchaser
         believes any Inventory purchased hereunder is likely to be Unused
         Inventory or Unused Unassigned Finished Goods, it shall advise the
         Seller on a reasonably timely basis of such likely Unused Inventory or
         Unused Unassigned Finished Goods, and shall act in good faith to (a)
         assist the Seller to identify opportunities (such as demand trends,
         current forecasts or cross sales) to use or consume such likely Unused

                                                                  Execution Copy

         Inventory or Unused Unassigned Finished Goods prior to exercising of
         the applicable put option, and (b) identify any cost-effective
         opportunities for Purchaser to use or consume such likely Unused
         Inventory at other Facilities or sites, to the extent practicable;
         provided, however, that such action by Purchaser and Seller shall not
         be a condition to the exercise of the applicable put option and the
         failure by Purchaser to take any such action shall not limit
         Purchaser's rights under this Section 5.15.

(7)      After exercising the applicable put option, the Unused Inventory or
         Unused Unassigned Finished Goods Inventory, as the case may be, shall
         at the option of the Seller or Designated Seller be managed on a
         consignment basis by the applicable provisions of the Amended and
         Restated Master Contract Manufacturing Services Agreement.

SECTION 5.16 EQUIPMENT PUT OPTION

(1)      The Purchaser and the Designated Purchasers shall have the following
         options to sell to Seller or the Designated Sellers:

         (a)      all Initial Obsolete Equipment (" INITIAL OBSOLETE EQUIPMENT
                  PUT OPTION" ); and

         (b)      all Subsequent Obsolete Equipment (" SUBSEQUENT OBSOLETE
                  EQUIPMENT PUT OPTION" ).

(2)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount of the Initial Obsolete
         Equipment and Subsequent Obsolete Equipment shall be deemed to be
         reduced by:

         (a)      the amount of Substitutable Equipment purchased or leased by
                  the Purchaser or Designated Purchasers or one of its
                  Affiliates, if any, during the applicable put period , unless
                  such purchased or leased Substitutable Equipment is required
                  to support forecasted requirements in excess of that support
                  by the Initial Obsolete Equipment and Subsequent Obsolete
                  Equipment;

         (b)      Equipment which is lost, stolen, destroyed or otherwise

                                                                  Execution Copy

(3)      If the Purchaser believes at any time prior to the applicable Equipment
         Usage Period or Subsequent Equipment Usage Period that any Equipment is
         likely to be Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete
         Equipment, the Purchaser shall advise the Seller on a reasonably
         timely basis of such likely Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent
         Obsolete Equipment and the Purchaser agrees to act in good faith to (a)
         assist the Seller to identify opportunities to use such Initial
         Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete Equipment prior to such
         exercise of the applicable put option and (b) identify any
         cost-effective opportunities for Purchaser to use such Initial Obsolete
         Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete Equipment including at other
         Facilities or Purchaser sites, to the extent practicable, provided
         that such action by Purchaser and Seller shall not be a condition to
         the exercise of the applicable put option, and the failure by Purchaser
         to take any such action shall not limit Purchaser's rights under this
         Section 5.16.

(4)      The applicable put option may be exercised by the Purchaser within
         sixty (60) days after the expiration of the Equipment Put Usage Period
         or Subsequent Equipment Usage Period, as the case may be, by sending a
         notice in writing to the Seller specifying (i) the identity of the
         Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete Equipment; (ii) the
         purchase price for the Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent
         Obsolete Equipment paid pursuant to this Agreement, less applicable
         depreciation under GAAP (individually or collectively, the "EQUIPMENT
         PUT PURCHASE PRICE"); and (iii) that the Initial Obsolete Equipment or
         Subsequent Obsolete Equipment has been calculated and determined in
         accordance with Section 5.16(1) and Section 5.16(2). The Seller shall
         have ten (10) Business Days within which to discuss with the Purchaser
         and the Purchaser shall make itself available to discuss with the
         Seller any questions or outstanding issues with respect to the
         Purchaser's exercise of the applicable put option. The Seller shall
         either (i) pay, or cause the applicable Designated Seller to pay, to
         the Purchaser the Equipment Put Purchase Price, within thirty (30)
         Business Days of receipt of each notice of exercise of the applicable
         put option, or (ii) send a written notice to the Purchaser within
         twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of each notice of exercise of the
         applicable put option that it objects to the calculation of the
         Equipment Put Purchase Price, failing which the Seller shall be deemed
         to have accepted the Equipment Put Purchase Price calculation. Any such
         written notice of objection from the Seller must state (a) the specific
         items of Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete Equipment
         which the Seller contends should not be included within the Equipment
         to be repurchased, and (b) the basis for its position with respect to
         each of such items of Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete
         Equipment which will be limited to mathematical errors or matters of
         the nature described in Section 5.16(1) and Section 5.16(2) above. In
         addition, any such

                                                                  Execution Copy

<PAGE>

                                     - 85 -

         written notice of objection must be accompanied within ten (10)
         Business Days by payment in full for the items of Initial Obsolete
         Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete Equipment which are not subject to
         such written notice of objection.

(5)      If any of the Initial Obsolete Equipment or Subsequent Obsolete
         Equipment subject to put option by the Purchaser or applicable
         Designated Purchaser is not Transferable Equipment (i.e., a leasehold
         interest only in favour of the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser), then
         the remedy for exercising the Initial Obsolete Equipment Put Option or
         Subsequent Obsolete Equipment Put Option, as the case may be, is not
         for the Seller or Designated Seller to pay an Equipment Purchase Price
         for such equipment, but rather for the Purchaser or Designated
         Purchaser, as determined by the Purchaser in its sole reasonable
         discretion, (i) to terminate the applicable lease without cost or
         penalty to the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser, or (ii) to reassign
         the applicable lease back to the Seller or Designated Seller without
         cost or penalty to the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser.

(6)      If the Seller objects to the Equipment Put Purchase Price calculation
         pursuant to Section 5.16(1) and Section 5.16(2) above then either the
         Seller or the Purchaser may refer the matter in writing to the
         Independent Accountant, who will promptly resolve the issue after
         discussions with each of the Seller and the Purchaser and in
         consideration of the concerns of each of the Seller and the Purchaser,
         and will prepare an Equipment Put Purchase Price schedule which
         shall be final and binding on the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller
         shall pay, or cause the applicable Designated Seller to pay, to the
         Purchaser the balance of the Equipment Put Purchase Price determined
         by the Independent Accountant (acting as an expert and not as an
         arbitrator) within ten (10) Business Days of any such determination,
         together with interest thereon at a rate equal to six percent (6%) per
         annum, calculated from the last date notice of objection was due
         pursuant to Section 5.16(1) and Section 5.16(2) above.

(7)      At the request of the Seller, the Purchaser shall provide to the
         Seller, to the extent reasonably practicable, such regular written
         reports relating to the Equipment (including Transferable Equipment
         deemed included in Owned Equipment pursuant to Section 5.14) as
         Seller may reasonably request as may be necessary to enable the Seller
         to comply with its statutory financial reporting requirements in
         relation to the accounting of the Equipment.

         the other Facility/ Design Closings referenced in Article 2. In such

         basis that either (i) the transfer of the French Contributed Assets
         cannot be made effective within three (3) Business Days of the
         Effective Time of the French/ Design Closing or, (ii) either Party
         determines not to proceed with the establishment of French Newco within
         two (2) weeks of the signing of this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge
         and agree that instead of a sale of the shares of French Newco as
         contemplated in Section 2.1(1)(p), the French Contributed Assets shall
         be sold instead through an asset transaction in the same manner as for
         the other Facility/ Design Closings referenced in Article 2. In such
         case, the costs of establishing French Newco, including the allocation
         of all the related Transfer Taxes, shall be as set forth in Section

determined in accordance with GAAP and such amounts jointly reviewed by the
Parties prior to the applicable Facility/ Design Closing. The Seller maintains
the right in its sole discretion to pay out to the Purchaser at any time the per

methodology used by and consistent with the books and records of the
Designated Seller and confirmed as at the applicable Facility/ Design Closing
Date, provided that such methodology is in accordance with GAAP) for each
French Transferring Employee who at that time is employed by Purchaser or
Designated Purchasers.

SECTION 5.30 RESTATEMENT ADJUSTMENTS

         To the extent that completion of the restatement of the Seller's
financial statements disclosed in Schedule 4.3 occurs after an applicable
Closing Date and results in further adjustment to the books and records of the
Seller or Designated Sellers such that the values set forth in the applicable
Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities would have been more favourable to
the Purchaser if such Statement had reflected the restated amounts, then,
notwithstanding the period for adjustments or disputes set forth in Section 2.4
shall have passed, there shall be a corresponding adjustment to the applicable
Closing Statement of Assets and Liabilities in accordance with the provisions
set forth in Section 2.4.

Limited and Mindready Solutions Inc. " MINDREADY" ) dated January 27, 2002 for
the provision of calibration and test building services be assigned to Purchaser
or a Designated Purchaser. However, as the CUCW filed a labour grievance against
Seller, regarding Seller's business transaction with Mindready (" THE GRIEVANCE"
), which has not yet been finally adjudicated, the Parties agree as follows:

(1)      If prior to the applicable Closing Date, Arbitrator Lussier's
         arbitration decision (relating to the Grievance) is upheld following
         judicial review, or alternatively, Seller settles the Grievance with
         the CUCW and, as a consequence, certain Mindready employees become
         employees of Seller or Designated Seller, then:

         (a)      the names and related Employee Information of such individuals
                  (or their replacements, given that the list of individuals is
                  subject at all times to change in accordance with the
                  provisions of the CUCW Collective Labour Agreement) will be
                  added to the Employee

                                                                  Execution Copy

                  Schedules as contemplated in Section 5.1(3)(a), and they shall
                  become Transferring Quebec Employees and be employed by
                  Purchaser or Designated Purchaser on the terms and conditions
                  of the CUCW Collective Labour Agreement and in accordance with
                  the provisions of Article 6 and Exhibit D-5, and

         (b)      the Mindready contract will be removed from the list of
                  "Assumed Contracts" and will be retained by Seller.

(2)      If on the applicable Closing Date, Arbitrator Lussier's arbitration
         decision has not been finally adjudicated or settled and, as a
         consequence, the individuals remain employees of Mindready, then the
         Mindready contract shall be an Assumed Contract, with the result that
         Flextronics will be required to use such Mindready employees to perform
         calibration and test set build work.

(3)      If subsequent to the applicable Closing Date, and thus following
         Purchaser or Designated Purchaser's assumption of the Mindready
         contract, Arbitrator Lussier's arbitration decision is upheld following
         judicial review, or alternatively, Seller settles that Grievance with
         the CUCW and, as a consequence, certain Mindready employees become
         employees of Seller or Designated Seller, then:

         (a)      the Parties will enter into a post-Closing amendment to this
                  Agreement in order that the individuals be treated in the same
                  manner as if they had been Transferring Quebec Employees as of
                  the applicable Closing Date, and they shall be employed by
                  Purchaser or Designated Purchaser on the terms and conditions
                  of the CUCW Collective Labour Agreement and in accordance with
                  the provisions of Article 6 and Exhibit D-5, and

         (b)      if the Mindready contract cannot, as a result of any terms and
                  conditions existing in such contract at the applicable Closing
                  Date and not as a result of any actions or omission by
                  Purchaser or Designated Purchaser, be terminated by Purchaser
                  or Designated Purchaser without additional cost, the Purchaser
                  or Designated Purchaser shall assign the Mindready contract
                  back to Seller.

(4)      If subsequent to the applicable Closing Date Arbitrator Lussier's
         arbitration decision is reversed following final judicial review and,
         as a consequence, the individuals remain employees of Mindready, then
         the Mindready contract shall remain an Assumed Contract of Purchaser or
         Designated Purchaser.

(5)      If any action taken by the parties pursuant to this Section 5.31 would
         have, or could reasonably have been expected to have, affected the
         Product pricing

                                                                  Execution Copy

         (whether upward or downward) had such action been taken prior to the
         completion of the VSHA pricing setting process set forth in Section
         5.22, then the applicable Parties agree to follow, after the applicable
         Closing, the process set forth in Section 11.1.1 of the Amended and
         Restated Master Contract Manufacturing Services Agreement for
         renegotiating "Prices" (as that term is defined therein) to reflect
         such action.

SECTION 5.32 SECURITY DOCUMENTATION

         The Purchaser shall deliver at the first Facility/ Design Closing the
Security Documentation in customary form acceptable to the Seller and the
Purchaser and containing such provisions as are necessary or appropriate to
provide the Seller with a first priority (subject to permitted encumbrances)
fully perfected security interest in the shares of French Newco, the Equipment
and the Inventory (collectively, the "SECURED ASSETS"). If and to the extent
the Purchaser causes a Designated Purchaser (other than the Purchaser) to
purchase all or a portion of the Secured Assets, then the Purchaser shall cause
such Designated Purchaser, on or prior to the Closing in respect of the relevant
Secured Assets, to agree to be bound by this Agreement in respect of such
Secured Assets as if it were the Purchaser under this Agreement, but without
prejudice to the liabilities of the Purchaser hereunder, or enter into with the
Seller or applicable Designated Seller of the relevant Secured Assets an asset
purchase agreement in substantially the form of this agreement and the Purchaser
shall guarantee, and cause such Designated Purchaser to perform, all of the
obligations of such Designated Purchaser under this Agreement, any other asset
purchase agreement executed and delivered pursuant hereto and any other
agreement or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement or any such other
asset purchase agreement. The Purchaser or applicable Designated Purchaser shall
also be permitted after the first Facility/ Design Closing to have an Affiliate
of the Purchaser purchase all or a portion of the Secured Assets provided the
same procedure in relation to the sale of the Secured Assets from the Purchaser
to the Designated Purchaser (other than the Purchaser) is followed, mutatis
mutandis.

SECTION 5.33 FACILITIES LICENSES

         No later than forty-five (45) days prior to the anticipated first
Closing Date, each of Seller and Purchaser shall determine, and in the event of
any disagreements shall negotiate in good faith with a view towards reaching
agreement by such date as to use (i) which sites, in addition to those at which
the Design Operations are conducted at the Ottawa Lab 2/ Lab 10 Facility and the
Monkstown Facility, will be the subject Licenses of Space, (ii) the space to be
licensed in each such site, (iii) the fees to be paid under each License of
Space (which represent the Seller's costs of owning and maintaining the space to
be licensed); (iv) the term of each License of Space; and (v) any other
modifications that may be appropriate to the form of License of Space. The
Parties acknowledge that their intent is to have the cost of the Licenses of
Space determined prior to the establishment of the initial VSHA Product

                                                                  Execution Copy

prices. Notwithstanding any general obligation of the Parties to mitigate Losses
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise under applicable Law, the
Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, if the Seller or its Affiliate
intends to market the Monkstown Facility either (i) for lease as a complete
facility, or (ii) for sale, then the Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
required to mitigate the Monkstown Real Property Losses through the leasing or
licensing of space at the Monkstown Facility to any third party (which for
greater certainty includes any Affiliate of the Seller or Designated Sellers.)

SECTION 5.34 ANNUAL INCENTIVE BONUS

(1)      In the event that Seller decides to award SUCCESS bonuses to eligible
         Employees in respect of SUCCESS Plan year 2004, such Employees whose
         Employment Transfer Date occurs in calendar year 2004 will receive a
         bonus payment at or about the same time in 2005 that other eligible
         Seller employees receive their bonus payment. Transferred Employees'
         bonus will be paid by Purchaser or Designated Purchaser in an amount
         that is equal to the amount such Transferred Employee would have
         received, in Seller's sole discretion, had he or she remained an
         employee of Seller or Seller Affiliate through calendar year 2004, and
         satisfied any and all other criteria required by Seller. Any such
         payment is deemed not to be a payment under the Nortel Networks SUCCESS
         Plan.

         The amount of the bonus that will be paid by the Purchaser or
         Designated Purchaser and the rules for determining the amount of the
         bonus, shall be determined by Seller in its sole discretion. The
         Purchaser or Designated Purchaser agree to make payment of the bonus to
         each Transferred Employee within forty five (45) calendar days
         following written notice from Seller as to the amount of the bonus with
         respect to each Transferred Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, the
         Purchaser or Designated Purchaser's obligation to make payment of the
         bonuses shall be an Assumed Liability.

         Seller shall reimburse Purchaser the Seller's pro-rata share of any
         bonus amounts paid, together with any payroll taxes required to be paid
         by Purchaser or the Designated Purchaser with respect to such bonus
         amounts paid based on the number of months in 2004 the Transferred
         Employee was employed by Seller or Designated Seller. For the avoidance
         of doubt, Seller's pro-rata share of the bonus payments shall be an
         Excluded Liability.

(2)      In the event that Seller decides to award SUCCESS bonuses to eligible
         Employees in respect of SUCCESS Plan year 2004, such Employees whose
         Employment Transfer Date occurs in calendar year 2005 will receive a
         2004 bonus payment at or about the same time in 2005 that other
         eligible Seller

                                                                Execution Copy
<PAGE>

                                     - 95 -

         employees receive their bonus payment. The bonus will be paid directly
         by Seller to the Employees.

(3)      In the event that Seller decides to award SUCCESS bonuses to eligible
         Employees in respect of SUCCESS Plan year 2005, any such Employee whose
         Employment Transfer Date occurs in calendar year 2005 will receive a
         bonus payment at or about the same time in 2006 that other eligible
         Seller employees receive their bonus payment. Transferred Employees'
         bonus will be paid by Purchaser or Designated Purchaser. Any such
         payment is deemed not to be a payment under the Nortel Networks SUCCESS
         Plan and the payment will be equal to a pro rata portion of the bonus
         that would have been payable for the full year, based on the number of
         months in 2005 that the Transferred Employee was employed by Seller or
         Seller Affiliate. The actual amount of the bonus that is paid by the
         Purchaser or Designated Purchaser and the rules for determining the
         amount of the bonus, shall be determined by Seller in its sole
         discretion. The Purchaser or Designated Purchaser agrees to make the
         bonus payment to each Transferred Employee within forty five (45)
         calendar days following written notice from Seller as to the amount of
         the bonus with respect to each Transferred Employee. For the avoidance
         of doubt, the Purchaser or Designated Purchaser's obligation to make
         payment of the bonuses pursuant to this subsection shall be an Assumed
         Liability.

         Seller shall reimburse Purchaser the bonus amounts paid by Purchaser
         pursuant to this subsection together with any payroll taxes required to
         be paid by Purchaser or the Designated Purchaser with respect to each
         bonus amount paid. For the avoidance of doubt the bonus payments paid
         by Purchaser pursuant to this subsection are an Excluded Liability.

                  Seller or Designated Sellers who continue employment with or
                  voluntarily terminate employment with the Seller or Designated

                  offer of the Purchaser or Designated Purchasers or objected to
                  their transfer of employment to the Purchaser or Designated
                  Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.1(c) shall prevent the
                  Purchaser or the Designated Purchasers from (i) conducting
                  generalized employment searches that are not focused on such
                  employees or former employees of the Seller or Designated
                  Sellers or (ii) hiring such employees or former employees of
                  the Seller or Designated Sellers identified through such
                  employment searches;

         (d)      For a period not less than eighteen (18) months following the
                  Effective Date, the Seller and the Designated Sellers shall
                  not, except with the Purchaser's prior written consent,
                  solicit for employment or hire any Transferring Employee; and

         (e)      Seller and Purchaser agree that there will be no transfer
                  (from Seller to Purchaser) of any assets or liabilities with
                  respect to any accrued pension benefits or other

         Termination Date, including but not limited to payments required under
         applicable legislation in relation to the termination of a tenancy or
         right of occupation. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
         Monkstown Real Property Losses shall not be included in the calculation
         of any pricing for any of the Products sold by the Purchaser or its
         Affiliates to the Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to the Amended and
         Restated Master Contract Manufacturing Services Agreement,
         notwithstanding that Gross Rent and the License Fee under the Monkstown
         Agreements for space occupied by the Purchaser or its Affiliates may be
         included in such calculations. The parties acknowledge and agree that
         the Monkstown Real Property Losses shall not be deemed to be special,
         incidental or consequential damages of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

         Shared Services Agreement.

(3)      The Purchaser shall have no liability under Section 7.3 unless and
         until the aggregate amount of all Losses relating thereto exceeds one
         half of one percent (0.50%) of the aggregate of the aggregate of the
         Facility Purchase Prices received by the Seller at the time of written
         notice of claim of Loss by the Seller (the "PURCHASER THRESHOLD"); at
         which point the Purchaser shall be liable for all Losses above one
         quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the aggregate of the Facility
         Purchase Prices (the "PURCHASER ONE-TIME DEDUCTIBLE). Notwithstanding

         pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall not exceed one hundred and fifty
         million dollars ($150,000,000) (the "PURCHASER CAP").

(4)      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.4(3), neither the Purchaser
         One-Time Deductible, the Purchaser Threshold nor the Purchaser Cap
         will apply to any breach by Purchaser or Designated Purchasers of any
         of its obligations in relation to the Operations or any of the Assets
         assumed by the Purchaser or Designated Purchasers pursuant to this
         Agreement; any of the provisions of

                                                                  Execution Copy

         to indemnification hereunder with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
         of, any representation or warranty or the compliance or failure to
         comply with any covenant or obligation shall not be affected by any
         investigation conducted by such Party or any knowledge acquired, or
         capable of being acquired by such Party at any time, whether before or
         after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the relevant
         Closing Date; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
         if a Party (i) has Knowledge of a Loss, (ii) delays notifying the other
         Party of such Loss, or fails to take commercially reasonable actions to
         mitigate such Loss, and (iii) as a direct result of such delay or
         failure the rights of the Indemnifying Party are adversely affected or
         additional costs or obligations are imposed upon the Indemnifying
         Party, then the indemnification obligations of Indemnifying Party shall
         be reduced commensurate to such adverse affect and/or additional costs
         or other obligations.

(6)      Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if on or before
         the applicable Closing Date, either Primary Party (the "FIRST PARTY")
         has advised the other Party (the "SECOND PARTY") in writing of (i)
         the inaccuracy of one or more of the representations and warranties
         made by the First Party in this Agreement as of the date made or as of
         the applicable Closing Date, or (ii) the breach of any covenant or
         agreement made by the First Party in Section 5.2 of this Agreement
         that, in any such case, by its terms contemplates compliance or
         performance at or prior to the relevant Closing, and if the Second
         Party enters into a written agreement to accept such disclosure and
         nonetheless effect the relevant Closing, then unless the Parties have
         expressly otherwise agreed in writing, the representations and
         warranties of the First Party set forth in this Agreement, and the
         covenants set forth in Section 5.2, shall be deemed qualified by, and
         subject to, such disclosure for purposes of this Article 7.

SECTION 7.5 DEFENCE OF THIRD PARTY ACTIONS

(1)      Promptly upon receipt by a Party of notice of any Action or threatened
         in writing Action by a Third Party against an Indemnified Party that
         could

                                                                  Execution Copy
<PAGE>

                                    - 104 -

         reasonable give use to a right to indemnification pursuant to Section
         7.2 or Section 7.3 ("THIRD PARTY ACTION"), such Party shall promptly
         give written notice describing the Third Party Action in reasonable
         detail to the Party who may become obligated to provide indemnification
         pursuant to Section 7.2 or Section 7.3 (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY").
         Failure to provide such notice by a Party pursuant to this Section
         7.5(1), however, shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
         indemnification obligations pursuant to this Agreement, except to the
         extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced as a result
         of such failure.

(2)      In connection with any Third Party Action, the Indemnifying Party shall
         have the right, at its option, to assume the defence of such Third
         Party Action at any time upon delivery of written notice to the Party
         seeking indemnity (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") in respect thereof. If the
         Indemnifying Party assumes the defence of any such Third Party Action,
         the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived any
         right to assert it is not required to indemnify the Indemnified Party
         for Losses arising with respect to such Third Party Action (subject to
         the deductible thresholds and caps set forth in Section 7.4) (unless
         the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party expressly agree, in
         writing, at such time to a different resolution of such matter). The
         Indemnifying Party shall select counsel reasonably acceptable to the
         Indemnified Party to conduct the defence of such Third Party Action,
         shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defence or settlement
         thereof and shall at all times diligently and promptly pursue the
         resolution thereof.

(3)      If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defence of
         any Third Party Action in accordance with the provisions of this
         Section 7.5, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written
         consent of the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably
         withheld) before entering into any settlement of such Third Party
         Action, if the settlement does not unconditionally release the
         Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to
         such Third Party Action or the settlement imposes injunctive or other
         equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or the settlement would
         establish future obligations under which the Indemnified Party or any
         of its Affiliates would be required to operate, (ii) the Indemnified
         Party shall be entitled to participate with counsel in the defence of
         such Third Party Action and to employ separate counsel of its choice
         for such purpose, (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall consult with the
         Indemnified Party with respect to any reasonable settlement offer
         received by the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party
         Action and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall use its reasonable efforts
         to otherwise consult regularly with the Indemnified Party during the
         pendency of any Third Party Action. The fees and expenses of such
         separate counsel to the Indemnified Party shall be paid by the

                                                                  Execution Copy
<PAGE>

                                    - 105 -

         Indemnified Party; provided, however, that such separate counsel fees
         shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to the provisions
         of Section 5.6(2). Notwithstanding that the Indemnified Party so
         participates in any such defence of a Third Party Action, the
         Indemnifying Party shall have full authority to determine all actions
         to be taken with respect thereto.

(4)      Each Primary Party shall cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates
         to cooperate, in the defence of any Third Party Action and shall
         furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and
         testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
         hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
         connection therewith. All costs and expenses incurred in connection
         with such cooperation shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. Under
         no circumstances shall the Indemnified Party compromise any such Third
         Party Action without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 7.6 SOLE REMEDY

         From and after the applicable Closing Date, except for claims by any
Primary Party resulting from Section 9.11, and Section 5.7, or as a consequence
of intentional misrepresentation, wilful breach or fraud on the part of the
other Primary Party or its Affiliates, the sole and exclusive remedy for money
damages of the Primary Parties hereto in connection with the purchase and sale
of the Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Local Sale Agreements, the
Shared Services Agreement, the Brazil Asset Purchase Agreement and the Nortel
Proprietary Software License Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this , and no Primary Party or its Affiliates shall have
the right to bring any proceeding against any other Primary Party or its
Affiliates for a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in any such agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, except
pursuant to this Article 7; provided, however, that this Section 7.6 shall not
limit the right of any Party under applicable Law to seek an injunction or other
equitable relief for a breach of any covenant or agreement.

SECTION 7.7 INDEMNIFICATION AFTER INSURANCE AND OTHER RECOVERIES

         The amount of indemnification payable in respect of Losses under
Article 7 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of (i) any amounts recovered or

         same manner as such Operations are then currently being conducted, then
         this condition shall be deemed to have been satisfied.

         in writing that such updated Schedules are not acceptable to the
         Purchaser, or (ii) if Purchaser has provided such notice, subsequently

rate of exchange prevailing on the date of payment, is the amount then due under
this Agreement in the Currency of the Agreement. Any additional amount due under

judgment being obtained for any other sums due or in respect of this Agreement
or any of the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 9.28 GUARANTEE OF PERFORMANCE

      The Guarantor, as principal obligor and not as surety, unconditionally and
irrevocably covenants with the Seller:

      (a)   to cause the Purchaser to effect prompt and complete performance of
            all the terms, covenants, conditions and provisions of the
            Transaction Documents that are to be kept, observed and performed by
            the Purchaser;

      (b)   that, if for any reason whatsoever, including the insolvency or
            bankruptcy of the Purchaser, or if the Purchaser shall at any time
            or from time to time fail to keep, perform or observe any term,
            covenant, condition or provision of any of the Transaction Documents
            that is to be kept, observed or performed by the Purchaser, then the
            Guarantor shall forthwith on demand of the Seller, perform or
            observe, as the case may be, such term, covenant, condition or
            provision in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
            Transaction Documents; and

      (c)   that the Guarantor is jointly and severally bound with the Purchaser
            to perform the terms, covenants, obligations (including
            indemnification), conditions and provisions of the Transaction
            Documents that are to be kept, observed and performed by the
            Purchaser and, in the enforcement of its rights pursuant to this
            Section 9.28 the Seller may proceed against the Guarantor as if the
            Guarantor was a principal party under this Agreement with respect to
            such terms, covenants, conditions and provisions applicable to the
            Purchaser.

      In the event of a default by the Purchaser under any of the Transaction
Documents, the Guarantor waives notice, presentment and any right to require the
Seller to:

      (d)   proceed against the Purchaser or pursue any rights or remedies with
            respect to the Transaction Documents against the Purchaser, or

      (e)   pursue any other remedy whatsoever in the power of the Seller prior
            to the Seller pursuing any rights it may have under the Transaction
            Documents against the Guarantor.

                                                                  Execution Copy
<PAGE>
                                    - 127 -

      Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the liability of the
Guarantor shall not be deemed to have been waived, released, discharged,
impaired or affected by reason of the release or discharge of the Purchaser in
any receivership, bankruptcy, winding-up or other creditors' proceedings or the
rejection, disaffirmance or disclaimer of any of the Transaction Documents in
any proceeding or any other matter, and shall continue with respect to the
periods prior thereto and thereafter, for and with respect to the Transaction
Documents.

      This guarantee shall continue notwithstanding any assignment of this
Agreement by the Purchaser to an Affiliate or otherwise pursuant to Section 9.28
and shall apply, mutatis, mutandis, in respect of any Affiliate of the Purchaser
in the event any such Affiliate is a party to any Transaction Document in lieu
of the Purchaser.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have duly executed this Asset Purchase
Agreement as of the date first written above.
