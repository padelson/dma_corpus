not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and no such withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is presently contemplated by Parent or
Purchaser (other than amendments or modifications that are permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;5.12</U>). The Debt Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and Parent and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent, the other
parties thereto. Except for the Debt Commitment Letter in the form delivered pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;4.9(a)</U>, as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing or the
Debt Commitment Letter that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing, to which Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates is a party and no such side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements are currently
outstanding. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (x)&nbsp;constitute a default or breach on the part of Purchaser or Parent and (in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter only, to
the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent) any of the other parties thereto, under any term of the Debt Commitment Letter, (y)&nbsp;result in a failure of any condition of the Debt Commitment Letters, or (z)&nbsp;to the Knowledge of Purchaser and

set forth in Article III, or the Company&#146;s compliance with its obligations under the terms of this Agreement). Purchaser and Parent have fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees or deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letter to
be paid on or before the date hereof. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to Parent&#146;s obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable), the aggregate net proceeds of the Debt Financing (when funded in accordance with
the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter) will be sufficient for Purchaser&#146;s and Parent&#146;s obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of the Offer Price in respect of each share of Company Common Stock validly tendered and
accepted for payment in the Offer and payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.5</U>, all amounts to be paid pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.6</U>, the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Offer and
the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of Indebtedness of the Company required in connection therewith) and the payment of all other amounts required to be paid by Parent and/or Purchaser in connection with the consummation of the
Transactions and to allow Purchaser and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement. The Debt Commitment Letter sets forth all of the conditions precedent of Parent and Purchaser to the obligations of the lenders party thereto to
make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent or Purchaser on the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and there are no other conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing except as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>4.10 Ownership of Company Common Stock</B>. None of Purchaser or Parent or any of

action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and promptly made (i)&nbsp;by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if
not a quorum, or (ii)&nbsp;by a committee of such directors designated by a majority of such directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii)&nbsp;if there are no such directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a

make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled to raise a defense as to any such action clear and
convincing evidence that such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted
without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board
of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
