Agreement

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I.

THE OFFER 

1.1 The Offer.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1_, as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
seven (7) Business Days) after the date hereof, Purchaser shall (and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act) the Offer to purchase all of the Shares at a price per share
equal to the Offer Price.

(a) The obligation of Purchaser to, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction, or
waiver by Purchaser or Parent, of the conditions set forth in _Annex A_  (the
" _Offer Conditions_ "). Subject to the satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser
or Parent, of the Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms
and irrevocably accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly tendered
and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the Expiration Date
and in any event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (the
time of such acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Time_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall Purchaser be required to accept for payment, and pay for, Shares validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer until the Marketing Period
shall have been completed. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid
net to the seller of such Share in cash, without interest, subject to the
withholding of any Taxes required by applicable Law, on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The time scheduled for payment
for shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to and
subject to the

 



6  conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_ _._ "

(b) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase that
describes the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this
Agreement. Purchaser and Parent expressly reserve the right to waive (in whole
or in part) any Offer Condition at any time and from time to time, to increase
the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of
the Offer; __provided__ , __however__ , that without the prior written consent
of the Company, Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change
the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or waive the Minimum
Condition, (v) amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in a manner
that is or could reasonably be expected to be adverse to any holder of Shares
in its capacity as such or impose conditions to the Offer that are in addition
to the Offer Conditions or (vi) extend or otherwise change any time period for
the performance of any obligation of Purchaser or Parent (including the
Expiration Date) in a manner other than pursuant to and in accordance with
this Agreement.

 

(c) Unless extended as provided in this Agreement, the Offer shall initially
be scheduled to expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days (calculated as set forth in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and
Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) after the commencement of the Offer
(the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) if, at
midnight, New York City time, on the Initial Expiration Date or any subsequent
date as of which the Offer is scheduled to expire, any Offer Condition is not
satisfied or, to the extent waivable in accordance with the terms hereof, has
not been waived by Purchaser or Parent, Purchaser shall (subject to the rights
or remedies of the parties hereto hereunder, including under _Article VII_ ),
extend (and re-extend) the Offer and its expiration date beyond the Initial
Expiration Date (the Initial Expiration Date as it may be extended herein is
referred to as the " _Expiration Date_ ") for one or more periods, in
consecutive increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each, the length of
each such period to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion (or such
longer period as Parent and the Company may mutually agree) to permit such
Offer Condition to be satisfied; (y) Purchaser shall have the right in its
sole discretion to extend the Offer beyond any then-scheduled expiration of
the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business
Days each, the length of each such period to be determined by Parent in its
sole discretion (or such longer period as Parent and the Company may mutually
agree) to the extent (A) Parent and Purchaser shall have waived the Financing
Proceeds Condition, (B) all of the Offer Conditions other than the Financing
Proceeds Condition have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Date, but subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) and (C) the Debt Financing
has not actually been received by Purchaser or Parent, and the lenders party
to the Debt Commitment Letter have not definitively and irrevocably confirmed
in writing to Parent and Purchaser that the Debt Financing in an amount
sufficient (together with cash available to Parent) to consummate the Offer
and the Merger will be available at the anticipated Acceptance Time on the
terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and subject only
to the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; and (z) if (A) the Financing
Proceeds Condition has been satisfied or waived less than five (5) Business
Days prior to the then-scheduled expiration of the Offer (including the then-
scheduled expiration date of the Offer) and (B) all of the other Offer
Conditions have been satisfied or waived at the then scheduled expiration of
the Offer (other than those conditions that 

 



7  by their nature are to be satisfied at the Expiration Date, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), then Purchaser and Parent
shall have a one-time right to extend the Offer pursuant to this sentence and
such extension shall be for a period of up to five (5) Business Days;
__provided__ , __however__ , that in no event shall Purchaser (i) be required
to extend the Offer beyond the earliest to occur of (A) the Outside Date and
(B) the valid termination of this Agreement in compliance with Article VII or
(ii) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the
prior written consent of the Company. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Purchaser shall, without the written consent of the Company, extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff, any rule or regulation of NASDAQ, or any
other applicable Law, in each case, applicable to the Offer.

(d) Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except for a
termination of this Agreement permitted in accordance with the terms of
_Section 7.1_. In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 7.1_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days of such termination),
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer, not acquire any Shares
pursuant thereto, and cause any depositary acting on its behalf to promptly
return in accordance with applicable Law all tendered Shares to the registered
holders thereof.

 

(e) On the commencement date of the Offer, Purchaser and Parent shall (i) file
or cause to be filed with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_ ") that will contain or incorporate by reference the related
offer to purchase the Shares pursuant to the Offer, the form of the related
letter of transmittal, the summary advertisement and other ancillary Offer
documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made
(collectively, and together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "); and (ii) cause the Schedule TO and
related Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares in accordance
with applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Purchaser and Parent in writing all information concerning the Company and its
stockholders that may be required by applicable Law to be set forth in the
Offer Documents or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 1.1(e)_. The Company and its counsel shall be
given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Purchaser and Parent shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company
and its counsel. Each of Purchaser, Parent and the Company agrees to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser and
Parent further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents
as so corrected (if applicable) to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities Laws. Upon receipt of any written or oral comments by
Purchaser, Parent or their counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Offer Documents, or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements to the Offer Documents, Purchaser and Parent agree to (i)
promptly provide the Company and its counsel with a copy of any such written
comments or requests (or a description of any such oral comments or requests);
(ii) provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to comment
on any proposed response thereto,

 



8  and to give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments
made by the Company and its counsel; (iii) provide the Company and its counsel
an opportunity to participate with Purchaser, Parent or their counsel in any
material discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide
the Company with copies of any written comments or responses submitted by
Purchaser and Parent in response thereto.

 

(f) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, merger,
issuer tender offer, exchange of shares or other like change with respect
to Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
Purchasers acceptance for payment of, and payment for, Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, and such adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to
the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such action and shall as so adjusted from and after
the date of such event, be the Offer Price; __provided_ , _however__ , that
nothing in this  _Section 1.1(f)_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to the Company Common Stock that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(g) Subject in all respects to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer Conditions, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any
shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase
pursuant to the Offer.

 

1.2 Company Actions.

 

(a) On the date the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto, the
" _Schedule  14D-9_") that, subject to _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ and _Section
5.4(d)(ii)_, shall contain and reflect the Company Board Recommendation and
include a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. Prior to such filing and the stockholder dissemination described below,
the Company shall set the Stockholder List Date as the record date for the
purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL.
The Company agrees that it will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply in all
material respects with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws and
contain notice of appraisal rights in compliance with Section 262 of the
DGCL. Each of Purchaser and Parent shall promptly furnish to the Company in
writing all information concerning Purchaser and Parent that may be required
by applicable Law to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9 or reasonably
requested in connection with any actions contemplated by this _Section
1.2(a)_. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be filed with the SEC
pursuant to this _Section 1.2(a)_ to be disseminated to the Companys
stockholders as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act concurrently
with the dissemination of the Schedule TO to the holders of Company Common
Stock by Purchaser. Except with respect to any amendments filed in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal or after a Change in Company Board
Recommendation, the Company agrees to provide Purchaser, Parent and their
counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and the Company shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by Purchaser,
Parent and their counsel. Each of the

 



9  Company, Purchaser and Parent agrees to promptly correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable Law; _provided_ , however, that any such filing of the corrected
Schedule 14D-9 shall not, unless otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent,
waive, extend or restart the notice period for purposes of Section 262(d)(2)
of the DGCL. Upon receipt of any written or oral comments or requests for
amendments or supplements by the Company or its counsel from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company agrees to (i) promptly
provide Purchaser, Parent and their counsel with a copy of any such written
comments or requests for amendments or supplements (or a description of any
such oral comments); (ii) provide Purchaser, Parent and their counsel a
reasonable opportunity to comment on any proposed response thereto, and to
give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made
by Purchaser, Parent and their counsel prior to responding to any such
comments or requests; (iii) provide Parent and its counsel an opportunity to
participate with the Company or its counsel in any material discussions or
meetings with the SEC or its staff; and (iv) provide Purchaser or Parent with
copies of any written comments or responses submitted by the Company in
response thereto.

 

 __(b) __In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer
agent to promptly furnish Purchaser and Parent with (i) mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares; and (ii)
security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a
recent date, and of those persons who become record or beneficial owners
subsequent to such date, together with other readily available listings and
computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of
record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The date of the
list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and Schedule
14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder List Date_." The Company
shall furnish Purchaser and Parent with such additional information, including
updated listings and computer files of record holders and beneficial holders
of Shares, mailing labels, addresses, and security position listings, and
such other assistance as Purchaser, Parent or their agents may reasonably
require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
Shares. Subject to applicable Law, and except for such actions as are

(a) _Company Options_. Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall assume any Company

As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of
any optionholder, (i) all Unvested Company Options outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and become
exercisable, and become Vested Company Options, and (ii) to the extent not

after the Effective Time) an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
deduction for any required withholding Tax), equal to the product of: (A) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of each such Company Option; and (B) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock underlying such Company Option; __provided__ , __however__ , that if the

Merger Consideration and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock

comply with Section 409A of the Code. With respect to any Company RSU which
was subject to vesting based upon attainment of performance criteria, the

 __(a) __On or prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall select a
reputable bank or trust company to act as payment agent in the Merger (the "
_Payment Agent_ "). At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
with the Payment Agent cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable pursuant to  _Section 2.5_. The cash amount so
deposited with the Payment Agent is referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." The
Payment Agent will invest the funds included in the Payment Fund in the manner
directed by Parent;  __ _ _provided_ , _however__ __, that such investments
shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or
any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit
of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or
P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank that are then publicly available). Any interest or other income
resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the property of Parent.
__

 

(b) Within five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, the Payment Agent
will mail to the Persons who were record holders of certificates previously
representing

 



13  any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Company Stock Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than to holders of Dissenting
Shares to the extent such holders do not also hold Shares that are not
Dissenting Shares): (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form reasonably
acceptable to the Company; and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Company Stock Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration.
Upon surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to the Payment Agent for
exchange, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter of
transmittal or receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or such
other evidence, if any, of transfer to the Payment Agent as the Payment Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of such book-entry shares, together with
a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and, in each case,
such other documents as may be reasonably required by the Payment Agent or
Parent: (A) the holder of such Company Stock Certificate or book-entry share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration;
and (B) the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.7 (b)_, each Company Stock
Certificate or book entry share shall be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration as
contemplated by _Section 2.5_. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the
cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of any Company Stock Certificate
or book-entry share. Payment of the applicable Merger Consideration with
respect to book-entry shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name
such book-entry shares are registered. If any Company Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent or the Payment Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of any Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Company Stock Certificate, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate
affidavit and to deliver a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving
Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
the Payment Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate. Upon the making of such affidavit and delivering
such bond, the Payment Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as
contemplated under this _Article II_.

 

(c) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed or undistributed to
holders of Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares as of the date that
is one (1) year after the Merger Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent
upon demand, and any holders of Company Stock Certificates (other than with
respect to any Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates or book-entry shares in accordance with this
_Section 2.7_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar Legal
Requirements) for satisfaction of their claims for the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.7_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or,
if earlier, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Body) shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of any
Company Stock

 



14  Certificate or to any other Person with respect to any Merger Consideration
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property
Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

 

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Law.

 

2.8 Dissenting Shares _._

 

 __(a) __Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting Shares_ " until
such time as such holder effectively withdraws or fails to perfect or
otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL
with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5_, but
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL. __

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with  _Section 2.5_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
the Company Stock Certificate representing such shares or transfer of such
book-entry share, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms hereof.

(c) The Company shall give Parent: (i) prompt written notice of (A) any demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL; (B) any withdrawal or attempted withdrawal of any such demand; and
(C) any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to
the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL; and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment or settlement offer or settle any
such demands prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand,
notice or instrument. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled
under Section 262 of the DGCL to receive payment of the "fair value" for such
holders shares shall receive such payment therefor from the Surviving
Corporation after giving effect to any withholdings required by applicable Law
(but only after the amount thereof shall have been finally
determined pursuant to the DGCL), and such shares shall be retired and
cancelled.

 



15 2.9 Withholding. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and Purchaser shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and
withhold) from the Merger Consideration payable to any holder of Shares,
Company Options, or Company RSUs or any other consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required by any applicable
Law to deduct and withhold with respect to Taxes. Each such payor shall take
all action as may be necessary to ensure that any such amounts so withheld are
timely and properly remitted to the appropriate Governmental Body. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares, Company Options, or Company RSUs or other recipient of consideration
hereunder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Purchaser
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Purchaser, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take and shall take such action.

(a) _Section 3.10_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth all material
Company Employee Benefit Plans and material Company Employee Agreements
(collectively,

 



22  the " _Company Plans_ ") and separately identifies each Company Plan that is
maintained primarily for the benefit of Company Employees outside the United
States, including each material old age part time and early retirement
scheme, retirement plan, pension plan (funded and unfunded), deferred
compensation and life insurance plan (each, a " _Foreign Plan_ "). For
purposes of this Agreement, any Company Employee Agreement that obligates the
Company to make any severance, tax gross up or similar payment to any Company
Employee or consultant or any spouse or heir of any Company Employee or
consultant or make any bonus, deferred compensation or similar payment to any
Company Employee or consultant shall be considered a material Company Employee
Agreement. The Company has made available to the Purchaser a complete and
accurate copy of (i) each Company Plan and all material amendments thereto
and (ii) all material correspondence relating to any Company Plan to or from
the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Labor, or any
other Governmental Body since January 1, 2012 through the date of this
Agreement.

(b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has maintained, established,
participated in or contributed to, or is or has been required to contribute
to, or has otherwise incurred any obligation or liability (including any

(c) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a
favorable determination letter (or, if applicable, advisory or opinion letter)
from the Internal Revenue Service that has not been revoked (or if not
determined to be so qualified, such Company Employee Benefit Plan may still be
amended within the remedial amendment period to cure any qualification defect
to the extent permitted by Law), and to the Knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred and no condition exists that would reasonably be expected
to materially adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company
Employee Benefit Plan or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or
tax under ERISA or the Code. Except as required by this Agreement, neither the
Company, nor, to the Companys knowledge, any other Person, has made any
binding commitment to modify, change or terminate any Company Employee
Benefit Plan, other than with respect to modifications, changes or
terminations required by any Law. None of the Acquired Companies have engaged
in a transaction in connection with which such Acquired Company reasonably
would be subject to either a material liability pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code
that is not curable without material cost.

 

(d) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in
all material respects in accordance with its provisions and in compliance
with all applicable Laws, including the applicable provisions of ERISA and the

such payment or contribution obligation has been reflected in the Available
Company SEC Documents which are publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement. For the last six (6) years, the Acquired Companies have performed
in all material respects all obligations required to be performed by them

to, or with respect to, any Company Employee pursuant to any retiree medical,
retiree disability, retiree life insurance benefit plan or other retiree
welfare plan.

 

(f) All Foreign Plans comply in all material respects with applicable Laws.
With respect to each Foreign Plan, either (i) such Foreign Plan does not
require funding and is not required to be recognized as a book-reserved plan,
or (ii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Foreign Plan funded through insurance, or
the book reserve established for any Foreign Plan, together with any accrued
contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide in full for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the date of this Agreement, with respect to all
current and former participants in such Foreign Plan according to the
actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to and obligations under such Foreign Plan, and no transaction
contemplated by this Agreement shall cause any such assets or insurance
obligations to be less than such benefit obligations.

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions (including in combination with other events or circumstances)

increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
increase the amount of, compensation or benefits due to any such Company
Employee, (iii) directly or indirectly cause the Acquired Companies to
transfer or set aside any material assets to fund any benefits under
any Company Employee Benefit Plan, (iv) otherwise give rise to any material
liability under any Company Employee Benefit Plan, (v) limit or restrict the
right to merge, amend, terminate or transfer any material assets of any
Company Employee Benefit Plan on or following the Effective Time or (vi)
result in the payment of any amount that would reasonably be expected,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, to constitute an
"excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

(h) Each Company Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has
been administered in compliance with its terms and the operational and
documentary requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations
thereunder, except for any instances of noncompliance that would not
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Acquired
Companies. No Company Plan provides for an obligation to gross-up, indemnify
or otherwise reimburse any Company Employee for any Tax incurred by such
Company Employee pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

3.11 Opinion of Financial Advisor. The Company Board has received from
Centerview Partners an opinion to the effect that, as of the date of such
opinion and subject to the various assumptions made, procedures followed,
matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken in preparing such

the holders of Shares (other Shares held by the Company (or held in the

certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Purchaser and Parent hereby
acknowledge and agree that: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-
looking statements, as well as in such business plans, with which Purchaser
and Parent are familiar; and (b) Purchaser and Parent hereby waive any claim
against the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives with respect to any information described in
this _Section 4.8_ unless any such information is expressly addressed or
included in a representation or warranty contained in Article III of this

Purchaser and Parent hereby acknowledge and agree that none of the Company nor
any Company Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Affiliates

warranty contained in Article III of this Agreement.

4.9 Financing.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct and complete copies of
(i) the executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Jefferies Finance LLC (together with all
exhibits, annexes, schedules and attachments thereto, including the Redacted
Fee Letter, the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject
to the terms and conditions thereof, the lenders party thereto have committed
to lend the amounts set forth therein to Purchaser for the purpose of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such financing,
the " _Debt Financing_ ").

 



38 (b) The Debt Commitment Letter is, as of the date hereof, in full force and
effect and has not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect, and no such
withdrawal, termination, rescission, amendment, supplement or modification is
presently contemplated by Parent or Purchaser (other than amendments or
modifications that are permitted by _Section 5.12_). The Debt Commitment
Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and Parent and,
to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent, the other parties thereto. Except
for the Debt Commitment Letter in the form delivered pursuant to _Section
4.9(a)_, as of the date hereof there are no side letters or other agreements,
contracts or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing or the Debt
Commitment Letter that could affect the availability of the Debt Financing, to
which Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates is a party and
no such side letters or other agreements, contracts or arrangements are
currently outstanding. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (x) constitute a default
or breach on the part of Purchaser or Parent and (in the case of the Debt
Commitment Letter only, to the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent) any of the
other parties thereto, under any term of the Debt Commitment Letter, (y)
result in a failure of any condition of the Debt Commitment Letters, or (z) to
the Knowledge of Purchaser and Parent, result in any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable (provided that Parent and
Purchaser are not making any representation or warranty regarding the effect
of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in Article
III, or the Companys compliance with its obligations under the terms of this
Agreement). Purchaser and Parent have fully paid any and all commitment fees
or other fees or deposits required by the Debt Commitment Letter to be paid
on or before the date hereof. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligation to consummate the Offer and/or the Merger (as applicable),
the aggregate net proceeds of the Debt Financing (when funded in accordance
with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter) will be sufficient for
Purchasers and Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the
payment of the Offer Price in respect of each share of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and accepted for payment in the Offer and payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.5_, all amounts to be
paid pursuant to _Section 2.6_, the payment of all associated costs and
expenses of the Offer and the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing
of Indebtedness of the Company required in connection therewith) and the
payment of all other amounts required to be paid by Parent and/or Purchaser in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to allow Purchaser
and Parent to perform all of their obligations under this Agreement. The Debt
Commitment Letter sets forth all of the conditions precedent of Parent and
Purchaser to the obligations of the lenders party thereto to make the full
amount of the Debt Financing available to Parent or Purchaser on the terms set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and there are no other conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing
except as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter.

of their "affiliates" or "associates" is, or at any time during the last
three (3) years has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL. Prior to the Agreement Date, neither
Parent nor Purchaser has taken, or authorized or permitted any Representatives
of Parent or Purchaser to take, any action that would reasonably be expected
to cause, Parent, Purchaser or any of their "affiliates" or "associates" to
be deemed an "interested stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or
otherwise render Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

and information regarding the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as Parent may
reasonably request. Information obtained by Purchaser or Parent pursuant
to this _Section 5.1_ will constitute "Confidential Information" under the
Confidentiality Agreement and will be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 5.1_ will require
the Company to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company (and after notice to Parent) would: (A)
violate any of its or its Affiliates respective obligations under any
Contracts with respect to confidentiality (provided, that the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts during the Interim Period to provide
Parent with redacted versions of any documents withheld in accordance with the
foregoing sub-clause "(A)" to the extent the provision of which does not
breach any confidentiality obligations); (B) result in a violation of
applicable Law; or (C) result in loss of legal protection, including
the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine (so long as the
Company has reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of or
to disclose such information on a basis that does not waive such privilege
with respect thereto), _provided_ , that information shall be disclosed, as
required above, subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary
form, to external counsel for Parent to the extent reasonably required
for the purpose of complying with applicable Antitrust Laws.

5.4 No Solicitation by the Company; Other Offers _._

 

(a) Until the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the date on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit
their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, except as
otherwise provided below in this _Section 5.4_: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or furnish any non-public information in connection with
or for the purpose of soliciting, initiating or knowingly encouraging any
proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) other than informing Persons of the existence of
the provisions contained in this _Section 5.4_, enter into, continue or
participate in any discussions or any negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal or any proposal or inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend or enter into an
Acquisition Proposal or any letter of intent, acquisition agreement,
memorandum of understanding or other Contract contemplating an Acquisition
Proposal, requiring the Company to abandon or terminate its obligations under
this Agreement; (iv) except where the Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel) that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, release or permit the release of any Person from,
or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of, or fail to enforce or
cause to be enforced, any "standstill" agreement to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries are a party; or (v) resolve, propose or agree to
do any of the foregoing. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease and cause to be terminated all discussions or negotiations with any
Person previously conducted with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and shall
promptly deliver a written notice to each Person that entered into a
confidentiality agreement in anticipation of potentially making an Acquisition
Proposal, to the effect that the Company is ending all discussions and
negotiations with such Person with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
effective on the date hereof, and the notice shall also request such Person to
promptly return or destroy all confidential information concerning the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries in the manner indicated in such confidentiality
agreements.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_ to the contrary, at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time, in response to an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed
on or after the date of this Agreement (and has not been withdrawn) and did
not result from any breach of this _Section 5.4_, that the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor)
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
the Company may, upon a good 

 



44  faith determination by the Company Board (after consultation with outside
counsel) that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law:
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives); __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that the Company and such
Person enter into a customary confidentiality agreement that contains
provisions that are not less favorable in the aggregate to the Company that
those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; and  _ _provided further__
, that (x) prior to or concurrently with furnishing any such information to,
or entering into discussions with, such Person, Parent receives written notice
from the Company or the identity of such Person and the Companys intention
to furnish information to, or enter into discussions with, such Person and (y)
any non-public information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary
provided or made available to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
shall (along with a copy of the executed confidentiality agreement), to the
extent not previously provided to Purchaser or Parent, be concurrently
provided or made available to Purchaser or Parent; and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
(and its Representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly advise Parent in writing, in no event later
than 36 hours after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition
Inquiry and shall indicate and provide the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, a copy of all material written
materials provided by the third-party in connection with the submission of
such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and a written summary of all
material oral communications made by any Person in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, and thereafter shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the status and the
material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry.

 

 __(d) __Neither the Company Board (nor any committee thereof) shall: (A)
fail to make, withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation
(including any failure to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9, when mailed); (B) adopt, approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable (or make any public announcement of its decision
to adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable) the adoption of
any Acquisition Proposal (each such foregoing action or failure to act in
clauses (A) and (B) being referred to as a " _Change in Company Board
Recommendation_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company Board may, at
any time prior to the earlier of the Acceptance Time, take any of the actions
set forth in _Sections 5.4(d)(i)-(iii)_ below;  __ _ _provided__ __, __ _
_however__ __, that prior to taking any such action, the Company complies with
_Section 5.4(e)_ of this Agreement: __

 

(i) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;

 

(ii) effect a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to an
Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with

 



45  outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law and the Company Board concludes
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor, that
the Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; and

(iii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ (and, if
applicable, enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement), if the Company
receives an Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor, constitutes a
Superior Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to enter into such
definitive agreement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

__(e) __Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in  _Section
5.4(d)_, the Company shall not be entitled to: (i) make a Change in Company
Board Recommendation pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ or _Section
5.4(d)(ii)_; or (ii) terminate this Agreement (and, if applicable, enter into
any Company Acquisition Agreement) pursuant to _Section 5.4(d)(ii)_, unless:
(A) in the case of Change in Recommendation under _Section 5.4(d)(i)_, a
Change in Circumstance shall have occurred, and, in the case of a Change in
Recommendation under _Section 5.4(d)(ii)_ or termination under _Section
5.4(d)(iii)_, the Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of
_Sections 5.4(a) (c)_; (B) the Company Board makes the determination set
forth in _Section 5.4(d)(i)_ in response to a Change in Circumstance and the
determination set forth in _Section 5.4(d)(ii)_ or _Section 5.4(d)(iii)_, as
applicable, in response to an Acquisition Proposal; (C) the Company shall
have first provided prior written notice to Parent that it is prepared to (x)
make a Change in Company Board Recommendation in response to a Change in
Circumstance or in response to a Superior Proposal (as applicable, a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ "), or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ in response to a Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Proposal Notice_ "), which written notice shall be provided at least three
(3) Business Days prior to making any such Change in Company Board
Recommendation, which notice shall, if the basis for the proposed action by
the Company Board is in response to a Change in Circumstance, contain a
description of the events, facts and circumstances giving rise to such Change
in Circumstance and the reason for the Change in Board Recommendation or, if
the basis for the proposed action by the Company Board is a Superior
Proposal, contain a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Superior Proposal, including a copy of the then current draft of the Company
Acquisition Agreement setting forth such Superior Proposal and all other
material documents relating to such Superior Proposal (it being understood and
agreed that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed
to be a Change in Company Board Recommendation); (D) Parent does not
make, within three (3) Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a
binding proposal that would, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board
(after consultation with outside counsel and, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, the Companys financial advisor), cause such Change in Circumstance
to no longer form the basis for the Company Board to effect a Change in
Company Board Recommendation or cause the offer previously constituting a
Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, as the case
may be (provided, that, the Company have negotiated in good-faith with Parent
(and caused its Representatives to negotiate with Parent) with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, so that, with respect to
_Section 5.4(d)(ii)_ and _Section 5.4(d)(iii)_ such Acquisition Proposal
would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and with respect to _Section
5.4(d)(i)_, so that such Change in Circumstance would no longer necessitate a
Change in Board Recommendation); and (E) if the Company __

 



46  intends to terminate this Agreement to enter into the Company Acquisition
Agreement, the Company shall have complied with _Section 7.1(g)_. Any
material changes with respect to the financial terms of such Superior
Proposal occurring prior to the Companys effecting a Change in Company Board
Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_
shall require the Company to provide to Parent a new Recommendation Change
Notice or Superior Proposal Notice and a new two (2) Business Day period.

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making
any disclosure to the Companys stockholders with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal if, in the good-faith judgment of the Company Board, after
consultation with outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _ _provided__ ,
__however__ , that this _Section 5.4(f)_ shall not affect the obligations of
the Company and the Company Board and the rights of Purchaser and Parent under
_Section 5.4(d)_ and  _Section 5.4(e)_ of this Agreement.

party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts: (w) to give the other
party reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Body regarding any
investigations, proceedings, filings, forms, declarations, notifications,
registrations or notices, and permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,

47  Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend and/or participate therein; (y)
if attending a meeting, conference, or conversation with a Governmental Body

in connection with any information or proposals submitted in connection with
any proceeding, inquiry, or other proceeding under any Antitrust Law relating

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, including without limitation, any provision of
this _Section 5.5_, shall require, or be construed to require, Parent or any
of its Affiliates to proffer to, or agree (i) to, sell, divest, lease,
license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise encumber, (ii) to hold separate and
agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses
or interest therein of Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license,
transfer, disposition or other encumbrance by any Acquired Company of any of
its assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein or to any agreement by such Acquired Company to take any of
the foregoing actions) or (iii) to agree to any changes (including, without
limitation, through a licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other
impairment of Parents ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses,
operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests therein or
Parents ability to vote, transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise
full ownership rights with respect to the capital stock of any of the Acquired
Companies if such actions reasonably could be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the operations or business of Parent and its Subsidiaries.

(c) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of Purchaser, Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be

applicable Law or Material Contract in connection with the Transactions;
__provided_ , _however__ , that all obligations of the Company, Purchaser and
Parent relating to the Debt Financing shall be governed exclusively by
_Section 5.12_, and not this _Section 5.5_. The Company shall promptly
deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing made, each such notice given and
each such consent obtained by the Company during the Interim Period.

 

5.6 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to the
execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Except as permitted in
accordance with _Section 5.4_, Parent and the Company shall thereafter
consult with each other before issuing, and, to the extent practicable, give
each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press
release or

 



48  other public statements with respect to the Offer and the Merger and
consider in good faith the views of the other party, and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any securities
exchange or trading market on which securities of Parent or the Company are
listed, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement
shall use reasonable best efforts to allow the other party or parties hereto
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of
such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any
such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release or
announcement, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party).

 

5.7 Director and Officer Liability _._

 

(a) From and after the Offer Closing Date until the sixth anniversary of the

Surviving Corporation or any of their respective applicable Subsidiaries, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, to: (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, against any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, and
provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present directors and
officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (in all of their
capacities) to the same extent such persons are indemnified or have the right
to advancement of expenses as of the Agreement Date by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to the Company Charter Documents, other
charter and organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries and the
indemnification agreements in existence on the date hereof that have been
disclosed to Parent between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
directors and officers of the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries; and
(ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations (or any successors), as the case may be, charter and
bylaws for a period of six (6) years after the Merger Closing, the current
provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification
of officers, directors and employees and advancement of expenses contained in
the Company Charter Documents.

(b) If Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other corporations or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) shall transfer
all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual,
corporation or other entity, then and in each such case, proper provisions
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

year "tail" prepaid policy on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
the indemnified parties, or any other person entitled to the benefit of this
_Section 5.7_, as applicable, than the existing directors and officers
liability (and fiduciary) insurance maintained by the Company (the "
_Existing D andO Policy_"), covering, without limitation, the Offer and the
Merger and Purchaser and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain such "tail" prepaid policy 

 



49 _ _ in full force and effect for six (6) years after the Merger Closing ;
_provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation expend
in any one year an amount in excess of 250% of the annual premium currently

comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement such
that a failure of a condition set forth in _Section (c)(ii)_ or _(c)(iii)_ of
_Annex A_ would occur; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that no such

the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange

5.10 Employee Matters _._

 

 __(a) __For purposes of this _Section 5.10_, (i) the term "
_Covered Employees_ " shall mean employees who are actively employed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary at the Effective Time; (ii) the term "
_Continuation Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary of the Effective Time and (iii) the term "
_Bonus Continuation Period_ " shall mean the period beginning at the Effective
Time and ending on December 31, 2015. __

 

(b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to, provide to the Covered Employees
for so long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Continuation Period
(i) annual base salary (or annual base pay) and, solely during the
Bonus Continuation Period, incentive cash compensation opportunity (i.e.,
cash bonus opportunities and commissions), in each case, no less favorable
than the annual base salary (or annual base pay) and incentive cash
compensation opportunity provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (ii) severance rights under any Company Employee Agreement
listed on _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and (iii)
employee welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate,
as selected in Parents sole discretion to either (A) those generally made
available to similarly situated employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries
under its welfare benefit plans and programs, or (B) to

 



50  those provided to such Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective
Time under the Company Employee Benefit Plans.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 5.10_ shall not limit the
obligation to comply with applicable Laws or to maintain any Company Employee
Benefit Plan that, pursuant to an existing contract (if any), must be
maintained for a period longer than one (1) year following the Effective Time.

 

 __(d) __In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to
participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(" _Parent Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for Covered Employees who
become eligible during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i)
waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan the Covered Employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plan; and (ii) provide each Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage under
any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such
amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee
benefit plan Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage
under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit
Plan. __

 

(e) To the extent a Covered Employee remains an employee of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary and participates in the
applicable benefit plan following the Effective Time, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to recognize, or shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries to recognize, all service of each Covered Employee
prior to the Effective Time, to the Company (or any predecessor entities of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility
purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes, except for vacation and
severance, as applicable) to the same extent as such Covered Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar Company Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, service of each
Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time shall not be recognized for the
purpose of any entitlement to participate in, or receive benefits
with respect to, any (i) non-elective employer contributions under any plan
of Parent or its Subsidiaries under Section 401(k) of the Code; or (ii) any
retiree medical program in which any Covered Employee participates after the
Effective Time. In no event shall anything contained in this _Section
5.10(d)_ result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.10_ shall (i) be construed to limit the right
of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including,
following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate
any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan, to the extent such amendment
or termination is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, or (ii) be
construed as a guarantee of continued employment or to require Parent,

 



51  the Company, or any of the Company Subsidiaries (including, following the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) to retain the employment of any
Covered Employee or any other particular Person for any fixed period of time
following the Effective Time, which employment may be terminated at any time
in accordance with applicable Law.

 

5.11 Confidentiality. The parties hereto acknowledge that Parent and the
Company have previously executed a confidentiality agreement, dated as of
March 8, 2015 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which Confidentiality
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms, except as expressly modified herein.

 

5.12 Financing _._

 

(a) Each of Purchaser and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange, consummate and
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing, including using their respective
reasonable best efforts to: (i) assert (other than through litigation)
its rights under the Debt Commitment Letter in the event of a breach thereof
by the Debt Financing Sources (as defined in _Section 7.3(h)_) thereunder,
(ii) enter into Financing Agreements with respect thereto, (iii) satisfy,
or cause their Representatives to satisfy, on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to, and within the control of, Parent, Purchaser or their
respective Representatives in such definitive agreements, and (iv) upon the
satisfaction of the Purchasers obligation to consummate the Offer or the
Merger, as applicable, consummate the Debt Financing, at the Offer Closing
(with respect to amounts required to consummate the Offer) and the Merger
Closing (with respect to amounts required to consummate the Merger);
_provided_ that under no circumstances shall Parent or Purchaser be required
to commence, participate in or pursue any Legal Proceeding against or
involving any of Financing Source or any other Person that has committed to
provide any portion of, or otherwise with respect to, the Debt Financing.

(b) Neither Purchaser nor Parent shall agree to any amendments or
modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any condition or other provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements without the
prior written consent of the Company (which may be granted or withheld in the
Companys sole discretion), if such amendments, modifications or waivers would
(i) reduce the aggregate amount of aggregate cash proceeds available from the
Debt Financing below the amount (after taking into consideration the funds
otherwise expected to be available to Parent) that is required to consummate
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to repay or refinance the debt contemplated to be replaced under
the Debt Commitment Letter (including any fees, premiums and expenses payable
in connection therewith), or (ii) impose new or additional conditions
precedent or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions
precedent in a manner adverse to Purchaser, Parent or the Company, in each
case, solely to the extent that such amendment or modification would be
reasonably likely to (A) prevent or delay or impair the ability of Purchaser
and Parent to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
(B) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser or Parent to enforce its rights
or remedies against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
Financing Agreements or (C) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the conditions precedent to obtaining the Debt Financing any
less likely to occur.

 



52 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to substitute other debt or equity
financing for all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter from the same and/or alternative Financing Sources so
long as such substitute financing is subject to funding conditions that are
not less favorable to Parent and Purchaser than the funding conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and so long as such substitute financing
would not adversely impact the ability of Parent and Purchaser to consummate
the Transactions on a timely basis.

__(d) __In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable in the manner or from the sources contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letter or Financing Agreements, (i) Parent shall promptly (but in
any event within one (1) Business Day) so notify the Company in writing and
(ii) Purchaser and Parent shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange and obtain, and to negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect to, alternative financing from the same
or alternative financial institutions in an amount (after taking into
consideration the funds otherwise expected to be available to Parent) equal to
the lesser of (i) an aggregate amount sufficient to consummate the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
the amount of financing that was contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any fees, premiums and expenses payable in connection therewith) on
the date of this Agreement as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event; ___provided_ __, __ _however_ __, that neither
Purchaser nor Parent shall be required to obtain, negotiate or enter into
any Financing Agreements with respect to any Debt Financing on terms and
conditions that are materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser
and Parent than those in the Debt Commitment Letter (taking into account any
flex provisions). The definitive agreements entered into in connection with
any Debt Financing or Alternative Financing, as applicable, are referred to in
this Agreement, collectively, as the " _Financing Agreements_." In the event
any alternative or substitute financing (an " _Alternative Financing_ ") is
obtained in accordance herewith, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Debt Financing" shall mean the financing contemplated by such
Alternative Financing as permitted to be modified pursuant to this _Section
5.12_, and (B) if a new financing commitment letter is entered into in
connection with such Alternative Financing (the " _New Commitment Letter_
"), references in this Agreement to the Debt Commitment Letter (except for
purposes of _Section 4.9_) shall be deemed to include the New Commitment
Letter and any other Debt Commitment Letter(s) that are not superseded by the
New Commitment Letter at the time in question. Without first obtaining the
Companys prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), neither Purchaser nor Parent shall directly or
indirectly take any action that would, or would be reasonably expected to,
adversely impact the ability of Parent to satisfy the Financing Proceeds
Condition. __

 

(e) Parent shall (i) furnish the Company complete, correct and executed copies
of the Financing Agreements or any alternative financing agreement entered
into in accordance with this _Section 5.12_ promptly upon their execution,
(ii) give the Company prompt written notice of any breach or threatened breach
of which either Purchaser or Parent is or becomes aware by any party of any
of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Financing Agreements of which Purchaser
or Parent is or becomes aware or any termination or threatened termination
thereof, and (iii) otherwise keep the Company reasonably informed in a timely
manner of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing.

the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_); and (B) the

agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that its receipt of the Company
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ or  _Section 7.3(b)_ shall,
except in the case of common law fraud or willful breach by the Company,
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement of Parent and
Purchaser and each of their Affiliates and Representatives, and the receipt
of the Company Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for
any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Purchaser, each
of their Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person in connection
with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and none of
Parent, Purchaser, their respective Affiliates or Representatives or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Legal Proceeding

 



63  against the Company or its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination.

Agreement to the contrary, the Company acknowledges and agrees on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates that in the event that Company shall receive full
payment of the Parent Termination Fee, together with indemnification pursuant
to _Section 5.13(e)_, the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee together with
the amount of any such indemnification shall, except in the case of common law
fraud or willful breach by Parent or Purchaser, constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement of the Company and each of its
Affiliates and Representatives, and the receipt of the Parent Termination Fee

The Company shall not be entitled to specific performance under _Section 8.6_

Parent, as the case may be, shall pay to the other party its costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection
with such litigation, together with interest on the amount of the applicable
fee from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of

New York (and the appellate courts thereof)., (ii) submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of

the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the

the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ hereof,

provisions of this Agreement are not performed by Purchaser or Parent in
accordance with the terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and that the
Company, at the Companys election, shall be entitled to specific performance
and the issuance of injunctive and other equitable relief in any such event
and prior to the valid exercise of any termination right by the Company in
accordance with _Section 7.1_. Purchaser and Parent further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the

satisfied at the Merger Closing);

(iii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded in accordance with
the terms thereof at the Offer Closing and the Merger Closing, as applicable;

8.7 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Purchaser
may assign, in its sole discretion, (a) any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the Company, but
no such assignment shall relieve Purchaser of any of its obligations under

provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace such term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

or provision, and this Agreement shall be valid and enforceable as so
modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in
the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or

Section 5\. Annual Meeting.

 

(a) The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for the purpose
of election of directors and for such other business as may lawfully come
before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors. Nominations of persons for

business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual
meeting of

 



1\.  stockholders: (i) pursuant to the corporations notice of meeting of
stockholders; (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (iii)
by any stockholder of the corporation who was a stockholder of record at the
time of giving of notice provided for in the following paragraph, who is
entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures
set forth in Section 5\.

 

(b) At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business shall be
conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting. For
nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting
by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 5(a) of these Bylaws, (i)
the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the
Secretary of the corporation, (ii) such other business must be a proper matter
for stockholder action under the DGCL, (iii) if the stockholder, or the
beneficial owner on whose behalf any such proposal or nomination is made,
has provided the corporation with a Solicitation Notice (as defined in this
Section 5(b)), such stockholder or beneficial owner must, in the case of a
proposal, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of at
least the percentage of the corporations voting shares required under
applicable law to carry any such proposal, or, in the case of a nomination or
nominations, have delivered a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders of
a percentage of the corporations voting shares reasonably believed by such
stockholder or beneficial owner to be sufficient to elect the nominee or
nominees proposed to be nominated by such stockholder, and must, in either
case, have included in such materials the Solicitation Notice, and (iv) if no
Solicitation Notice relating thereto has been timely provided pursuant to this
section, the stockholder or beneficial owner proposing such business or
nomination must not have solicited a number of proxies sufficient to have
required the delivery of such a Solicitation Notice under this Section 5\. To
be timely, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of
business on the ninetieth (90th) day nor earlier than the close of business on
the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to the first anniversary of the
preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the
date of the annual meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to or
delayed by more than thirty (30) days after the anniversary of the preceding
years annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so
delivered not earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth
(120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual
meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement
of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall the public
announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new time period
for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Such
stockholders notice shall set forth: (A) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposed to nominate for election or reelection as a director all
information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or
is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act") and Rule 14a-4(d)
thereunder (including such persons written consent to being named in the
proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (B) as
to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring before the
meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any
material interest in such business of such stockholder and the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C) as to the
stockholder giving the 

 



2\.  notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or
proposal is made (i) the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear
on the corporations books, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class and
number of shares of the corporation which are owned beneficially and of record
by such stockholder and such beneficial owner, and (iii) whether either such
stockholder or beneficial owner intends to deliver a proxy statement and form
of proxy to holders of, in the case of the proposal, at least the percentage
of the corporations voting shares required under applicable law to carry the
proposal or, in the case of a nomination or nominations, a sufficient number
of holders of the corporations voting shares to elect such nominee or
nominees (an affirmative statement of such intent, a " _Solicitation Notice_
").

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 5(b) of these
Bylaws to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be
elected to the Board of Directors of the corporation is increased and there is
no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying
the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the corporation at least
one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years
annual meeting, a stockholders notice required by this Section 5 shall also
be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the corporation.

 

(d) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 5 shall be eligible to serve as directors and only such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been
brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 5\. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Chairperson of the
meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or any
business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made, or proposed, as
the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in these Bylaws
and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with these
Bylaws, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall not be
presented for stockholder action at the meeting and shall be disregarded.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, in order to
include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy
statement and form of proxy for a stockholders meeting, stockholders must
provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act.
Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders
to request inclusion of proposals in the corporation proxy statement pursuant
to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act.

(f) For purposes of this Section 5, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the 1934 Act.

 



3\. Section 6\. Special Meetings.

 

(a) Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be called, for
any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors,
(ii) the Chief Executive Officer, (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a
resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors
(whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized
directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of
Directors for adoption) or (iv) by the holders of shares entitled to cast not
less than ten percent (10%) of the votes at the meeting, and shall be held at
such place, on such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors shall
fix.

At any time that the corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of the
California General Corporation Law (" _CGCL_ "), stockholders holding five
percent (5%) or more of the outstanding shares shall have the right to call a
special meeting of stockholders as set forth in Section 18(b) herein.

(b) If a special meeting is properly called by any person or persons other
than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the
general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be
delivered personally or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested, or by telegraphic or other facsimile transmission to
the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, or
the Secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such
special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The Board of
Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which
shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the date of the receipt of the request. Upon determination of
the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall
cause notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance
with the provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws. Nothing contained in this
paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time
when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may
be held.

Section 7. Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by law, notice,
given in writing or by electronic transmission, of each meeting of
stockholders shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60)
days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at
such meeting, such notice to specify the place, if any, date and hour, in the
case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes of the meeting, and the
means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at any such
meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholders address
as it appears on the records of the corporation. Notice of the time, place,
if any, and purpose of any meeting of stockholders may be waived in writing,
signed by the person entitled to notice thereof or by electronic transmission
by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by
any stockholder by his attendance thereat in person, by remote communication,
if applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for
the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened. Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by
the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof
had been given.

 



4\. Section 8\. Quorum. At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise
provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation of the corporation
as currently in effect (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), or by these
Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by
proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be
adjourned, from time to time, either by the Chairperson of the meeting or by
vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat, but no
other business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present
at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is present, may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum. Except as
otherwise provided by statute, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the
affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person, by remote
communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the
meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter shall be the act
of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the Certificate
of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be elected by a plurality of
the votes of the shares present in person, by remote communication, if
applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized at the meeting and
entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a separate vote
by a class or classes or series is required, except where otherwise provided
by the statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a
majority of the outstanding shares of such class or classes or series, present
in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy
duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with
respect to that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by
statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the
affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of
directors) of shares of such class or classes or series present in person, by
remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at the meeting
shall be the act of such class or classes or series.

Section 9\. Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of
stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time
either by the Chairperson of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the
shares present in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or
represented by proxy. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place,
if any, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place, if any, thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting
shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

Section 10\. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those stockholders
entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as otherwise
provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock records
of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of these
Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Every person
entitled to vote or execute consents shall have the right to do so either in
person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by an agent or agents
authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware law. An agent so
appointed need not be a stockholder. No proxy shall be voted after three (3)
years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer
period. 

 



5\. Section 11\. Joint Owners of Stock. If shares or other securities having
voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether
fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common,
tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the
same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary
is given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the
instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is
so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following
effect: (a) if only one (1) votes, his act binds all; (b) if more than one (1)
votes and the vote is not evenly split, the act of the majority so voting
binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the vote is evenly split on
any particular matter, each faction may vote the securities in question
proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of Chancery for relief as
provided in the DGCL, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the
Secretary shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority
or even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-
split in interest.

Section 12\. List of Stockholders. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at
least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of
the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical
order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information
required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the
meeting, or during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business
of the corporation. In the event that the corporation determines to make the
list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable
steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
corporation. The list shall be open to examination of any stockholder during
the time of the meeting as provided by law. 

Section 13\. Action Without Meeting.

 

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action
required by statute to be taken at any annual or special meeting of the
stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, or by electronic
transmission setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the
holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes
that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which
all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.

(b) Every written consent or electronic transmission shall bear the date of
signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent
or electronic transmission shall be effective to take the corporate action
referred to therein unless, within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated
consent delivered to the corporation in the manner herein required, written
consents or electronic transmissions signed by a sufficient number of
stockholders to take action are delivered to the corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody of the book
in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery made
to a corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified
or registered mail, return receipt requested.

 



6\. (c) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who
have not consented in writing or by electronic transmission and who, if the
action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the
meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date that written
consents signed by a sufficient number of stockholders to take action were
delivered to the corporation as provided in Section 228(c) of the DGCL. If the
action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a
certificate under any section of the DGCL if such action had been voted on by
stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such
section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section
concerning any vote of stockholders, that written consent has been given in
accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL.

 

(d) A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an
action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be
deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this section,
provided that any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission
sets forth or is delivered with information from which the corporation
can determine (i) that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic
transmission was transmitted by the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person
or persons authorized to act for the stockholder and (ii) the date on which
such stockholder or proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted
such telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such
telegram, cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed
to be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by

DIRECTORS

 

Section 15\. Number and Term of Office. The authorized number of directors of
the corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors from time to time.
Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of
Incorporation. If for any cause, the directors shall not have been elected at
an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient.

Section 16\. Powers. The business and affairs of the corporation shall be
managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors, except as may be
otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation.

 

Section 17\. Term of Directors.

 

(a) Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to
elect additional directors under specified circumstances, directors shall be
elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to serve until the next annual
meeting of stockholders and his successor is duly elected and qualified or
until his death, resignation or removal. No decrease in the number
of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of
any incumbent director.

(b) No person entitled to vote at an election for directors may cumulate
votes to which such person is entitled, unless, at the time of such election,
the corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of the CGCL. During such time or
times that the corporation is subject to 

 



8\.  Section 2115(b) of the CGCL, every stockholder entitled to vote at an
election for directors may cumulate such stockholders votes and give one
candidate a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected
multiplied by the number of votes to which such stockholders shares are
otherwise entitled, or distribute the stockholders votes on the same
principle among as many candidates as such stockholder thinks fit. No
stockholder, however, shall be entitled to so cumulate such stockholders
votes unless (i) the names of such candidate or candidates have been placed in
nomination prior to the voting and (ii) the stockholder has given notice at
the meeting, prior to the voting, of such stockholders intention to cumulate
such stockholders votes. If any stockholder has given proper notice to
cumulate votes, all stockholders may cumulate their votes for any candidates
who have been properly placed in nomination. Under cumulative voting, the
candidates receiving the highest number of votes, up to the number of
directors to be elected, are elected.

 

Section 18\. Vacancies.

 

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject
to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, any vacancies
on the Board of Directors resulting from death, resignation, disqualification,
removal or other causes and any newly created directorships resulting from any
increase in the number of directors shall, unless the Board of Directors
determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created
directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be filled only by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even though
less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining
director, provided, however, that whenever the holders of any class or classes
of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created
directorships of such class or classes or series shall, unless the Board of
Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created
directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be filled by a majority of the
directors elected by such class or classes or series thereof then in office,
or by a sole remaining director so elected. Any director elected in accordance
with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the
full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and
until such directors successor shall have been elected and qualified. A
vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this Bylaw in
the case of the death, removal or resignation of any director.

(b) At any time that the corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of
the CGCL, if, after the filling of any vacancy, the directors then in office
who have been elected by stockholders constitute less than a majority of the
directors then in office, then

 

(i) any holder or holders of an aggregate of five percent (5%) or more of the
total number of shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for
those directors may call a special meeting of stockholders; or

(ii) the Superior Court of the proper county shall, upon application of such
stockholder or stockholders, summarily order a special meeting of the
stockholders, to be held to elect the entire board, all in accordance with
Section 305(c) of the CGCL, and the term of office of any director shall
terminate upon election of his/her successor.

 



9\. Section 19\. Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by delivering
his or her notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the Secretary,
such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a particular time,
upon receipt by the Secretary or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors. If
no such specification is made, it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure
of the Board of Directors. When one or more directors shall resign from the
Board of Directors, effective at a future date, a majority of the directors
then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such
resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so
chosen shall hold office for the unexpired portion of the term of
the director whose place shall be vacated and until his successor shall have
been duly elected and qualified.

Section 20. Removal.

(a) Subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law, the Board of
Directors or any director may be removed from office at any time (i) with
cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the
voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the
corporation entitled to vote generally at an election of directors or (ii)
without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66-2/3% of
the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the
corporation, entitled to elect such director.

 

(b) During such time that the corporation is subject to Section 2115(b) of the
CGCL, the Board of Directors or any individual director may be removed from
office at any time without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote on such removal;
provided, however, that unless the entire Board is removed, no individual
director may be removed when the votes cast against such directors removal,
or not consenting in writing to such removal, would be sufficient to elect
that director if voted cumulatively at an election which the same total number
of votes were cast (or, if such action is taken by written consent, all
shares entitled to vote were voted) and the entire number of directors
authorized at the time of such directors most recent election were then being
elected.

place of special meetings of the Board of Directors. Notice of any special
meeting of any committee may be waived in writing at any time before or after
the meeting and will be waived by any director by attendance thereat, except
when the director attends such special meeting for the express purpose of

business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Unless
otherwise provided by the Board of Directors in the resolutions authorizing
the creation of the committee, a majority of the authorized number of members
of any such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of

to the Secretary, request the Board of Directors to fix a record date. The
Board of Directors shall promptly, but in all events within ten (10) days
after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing
the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
within ten (10) days of the date on which such a request is received, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of
Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a

the corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of

receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other

be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
share or shares on the part of any other person whether or not it shall
have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the
laws of Delaware.

authenticated by the manual signature, or where permissible facsimile
signature, of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond,
debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signatures of the
persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or
other corporate security may be the imprinted facsimile of the signatures of
such persons. Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture
or other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall
be signed by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the corporation or
such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, or bear
imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person. In case any officer
who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or other corporate
security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or on any such
interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond,
debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been
delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may
be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person
who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon
had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.

ARTICLE XI

INDEMNIFICATION 

Section 43\. Indemnification of Directors, Executive Officers, Other Officers,
Employees and Other Agents.

 

(a) Directors and Executive Officers. The corporation shall indemnify its
directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XI,
"executive officers" shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated
under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any
other applicable law; _provided, however,_ that the corporation may modify
the extent of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors
and executive officers; and, _provided, further,_ that the corporation shall
not be required to indemnify any director or executive officer in connection
with any proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i)
such indemnification is expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the
proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii)
such indemnification is provided by the corporation, in its sole discretion,
pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under the Delaware General
Corporation Law or any other applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is
required to be made under subsection (d).

(b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents. The corporation shall have
power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as set
forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law. The Board of Directors shall
have the power to delegate the determination of whether indemnification shall
be given to any such person to such officers or other persons as the Board of
Directors shall determine.

(c) Expenses. The corporation shall advance to any person who was or is
a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a director or
executive officer, of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final
disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all
expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with such
proceeding, provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of
an undertaking, by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so
advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from
which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not entitled
to be indemnified for such expenses under this Section 43 or otherwise.

 



19\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation to
an executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that
such executive officer is or was a director of the corporation, in which event
this paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is
reasonably and promptly made (i) by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of
directors who were not parties to the proceeding, even if not a quorum, or
(ii) by a committee of such directors designated by a majority of such
directors, even though less than a quorum, or (iii) if there are no such
directors, or such directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in
a written opinion, that the facts known to the decision-making party at the
time such determination is made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such
person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe to
be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.

(d) Enforcement. Without the necessity of entering into an express contract,
all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and executive
officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights and be
effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract between the
corporation and the director or executive officer. Any right to
indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or executive
officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right
in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification
or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such
claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor. The claimant in
such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled
to be paid also the expense of prosecuting the claim. In connection with any
claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a
defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other applicable law
for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed. In
connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a
director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled
to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that
such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not believe
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted without
reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the failure
of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal
counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set
forth in the DGCL or any other applicable law, nor an actual determination by
the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel
or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct. 

(e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this
Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or
hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of

 



20\.  stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
office. The corporation is specifically authorized to enter into individual
contracts with any or all of its directors, officers, employees or agents
respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited
by the DGCL or any other applicable law.

 

(f) Survival of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this Bylaw shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, or executive officer
shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such
a person.

(g) Insurance. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, or any other
applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of Directors, may
purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted to be
indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.

 

(h) Amendments. Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only be
prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the
time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the
cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

 

(i) Saving Clause. If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on
any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the corporation shall
nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to the full extent
not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that shall not have
been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this Section 43 shall be
invalid due to the application of the indemnification provisions of another
jurisdiction, then the corporation shall indemnify each director and executive
officer to the full extent under applicable law.

 

(j) Certain Definitions. For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following
definitions shall apply:

 

(1) The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall include,
without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution, defense,
settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony in, any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative.

 

(2) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall include, without
limitation, court costs, attorneys fees, witness fees, fines, amounts paid
in settlement or judgment and any other costs and expenses of any nature or
kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

 

(3) The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting
corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a
constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate
existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its
directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or
was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or
is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture,

 



21\.  trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the
provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the resulting or surviving
corporation as he would have with respect to such constituent corporation if
its separate existence had continued.

(4) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer," "employee,"
or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without limitation, situations
where such person is serving at the request of the corporation as,
respectively, a director, executive officer, officer, employee, trustee or
agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise.

 

(5) References to "other enterprises" shall include employee benefit plans;
references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person
with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to "serving at the
request of the corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer,
employee or agent of the corporation which imposes duties on, or involves
services by, such director, officer, employee, or agent with respect to an
employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who
acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in the
interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests
of the corporation" as referred to in this Bylaw.

 

ARTICLE XII

NOTICES 

Section 44\. Notices.

 

(a) Notice to Stockholders. Written notice to stockholders of stockholder
meetings shall be given as provided in Section 7 herein. Without limiting the
manner by which notice may otherwise be given effectively to stockholders
under any agreement or contract with such stockholder, and except as otherwise
required by law, written notice to stockholders for purposes other
than stockholder meetings may be sent by United States mail or nationally
recognized overnight courier, or by facsimile, telegraph or telex or by
electronic mail or other electronic means.

 

(b) Notice to Directors. Any notice required to be given to any director may
be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or as provided for in
Section 21 of these Bylaws. If such notice is not delivered personally, it
shall be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in writing
with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known post
office address of such director.

(c) Affidavit of Mailing. An affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly
authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent
appointed with respect to the class of stock affected or other agent,
specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of the stockholder
or stockholders, or director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices
was or were given, and the time and method of giving the same, shall in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained.

 



22\. (d) Methods of Notice. It shall not be necessary that the same method of
giving notice be employed in respect of all recipients of notice, but one
permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any
other permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or
others.

 

(e) Notice to Person with Whom Communication Is Unlawful. Whenever notice is
required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom
communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not
be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority
or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any
action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such
person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and
effect as if such notice had been duly given. In the event that the action
taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
under any provision of the DGCL, the certificate shall state, if such is the
fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled
to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.

(f) Notice to Stockholders Sharing an Address. Except as otherwise prohibited
under DGCL, any notice given under the provisions of DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation or the Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written
notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the
stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given. Such consent shall
have been deemed to have been given if such stockholder fails to object in
writing to the corporation within 60 days of having been given notice by
the corporation of its intention to send the single notice. Any consent shall
be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the corporation.

 

ARTICLE XIII

AMENDMENTS 

__Section 45\. Amendments. __The Board of Directors is expressly empowered to
adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws of the corporation. The stockholders shall also
have power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation; _provided,
however_ , that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series
of stock of the corporation required by law or by the Certificate of
Incorporation, such action by stockholders shall require the affirmative vote
of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. __

 



23\. ARTICLE XIV

 

RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

 

Section 46\. Right of First Refusal. No stockholder shall sell, assign,
pledge, or in any manner transfer any of the shares of stock of the
corporation or any right or interest therein, whether voluntarily or by
operation of law, or by gift or otherwise, except by a transfer which meets
the requirements hereinafter set forth in this bylaw:

 

(a) If the stockholder desires to sell or otherwise transfer any of his shares
of stock, then the stockholder shall first give written notice thereof to the
corporation. The notice shall name the proposed transferee and state the
number of shares to be transferred, the proposed consideration, and all other
terms and conditions of the proposed transfer.

 

(b) For thirty (30) days following receipt of such notice, the corporation
shall have the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the shares
specified in the notice at the price and upon the terms set forth in such
notice; _provided, however_ , that, with the consent of the stockholder, the
corporation shall have the option to purchase a lesser portion of the shares
specified in said notice at the price and upon the terms set forth therein. In
the event of a gift, property settlement or other transfer in which the
proposed transferee is not paying the full price for the shares, and that is
not otherwise exempted from the provisions of this Section 46, the price
shall be deemed to be the fair market value of the stock of the corporation at
such time as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. In the event
the corporation elects to purchase all of the shares or, with consent of the
stockholder, a lesser portion of the shares, it shall give written notice to
the transferring stockholder of its election and settlement for said shares
shall be made as provided below in paragraph (d).

(c) The corporation may assign its rights hereunder.

 

(d) In the event the corporation and/or its assignee(s) elect to acquire any
of the shares of the transferring stockholder as specified in said
transferring stockholders notice, the Secretary of the corporation shall so
notify the transferring stockholder and settlement thereof shall be made in
cash within thirty (30) days after the Secretary of the corporation
receives said transferring stockholders notice; provided that if the terms
of payment set forth in said transferring stockholders notice were other than
cash against delivery, the corporation and/or its assignee(s) shall pay for
said shares on the same terms and conditions set forth in said transferring
stockholders notice.

(e) In the event the corporation and/or its assignees(s) do not elect to
acquire all of the shares specified in the transferring stockholders notice,
said transferring stockholder may, within the sixty (60) day period following
the expiration or waiver of the option rights granted to the corporation
and/or its assignees(s) herein, transfer the shares specified in said
transferring stockholders notice which were not acquired by the corporation
and/or its assignees(s) as specified in said transferring stockholders
notice. All shares so sold by said transferring stockholder shall continue to
be subject to the provisions of this bylaw in the same manner as before said
transfer.

 

(f) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the following
transactions shall be exempt from the provisions of this bylaw:

 



24\. (1) A stockholders transfer of any or all shares held either during
such stockholders lifetime or on death by will or intestacy to such
stockholders immediate family or to any custodian or trustee for the account
of such stockholder or such stockholders immediate family or to any limited
partnership of which the stockholder, members of such stockholders immediate
family or any trust for the account of such stockholder or such stockholders
immediate family will be the general or limited partner(s) of such
partnership. "Immediate family" as used herein shall mean spouse, lineal
descendant, father, mother, brother, or sister of the stockholder making such
transfer.

 

(2) A stockholders bona fide pledge or mortgage of any shares with a
commercial lending institution, provided that any subsequent transfer of said
shares by said institution shall be conducted in the manner set forth in this
bylaw.

(3) A stockholders transfer of any or all of such stockholders shares to
the corporation or to any other stockholder of the corporation.

 

(4) A stockholders transfer of any or all of such stockholders shares to a
person who, at the time of such transfer, is an officer or director of the
corporation.

(5) A corporate stockholders transfer of any or all of its shares pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms of any merger, consolidation,
reclassification of shares or capital reorganization of the corporate
stockholder, or pursuant to a sale of all or substantially all of the stock or
assets of a corporate stockholder.

 

(6) A corporate stockholders transfer of any or all of its shares to any or
all of its stockholders.

 

(7) A transfer by a stockholder which is a limited or general partnership to
any or all of its partners or former partners in accordance with partnership
interests.

In any such case, the transferee, assignee, or other recipient shall receive
and hold such stock subject to the provisions of this bylaw, and there shall
be no further transfer of such stock except in accord with this bylaw.

 

(g) The provisions of this bylaw may be waived with respect to any transfer
either by the corporation, upon duly authorized action of its Board of
Directors, or by the stockholders, upon the express written consent of the
owners of a majority of the voting power of the corporation (excluding the
votes represented by those shares to be transferred by the transferring
stockholder). This bylaw may be amended or repealed either by a duly
authorized action of the Board of Directors or by the stockholders, upon the
express written consent of the owners of a majority of the voting power of the
corporation.

 

(h) Any sale or transfer, or purported sale or transfer, of securities of the
corporation shall be null and void unless the terms, conditions, and
provisions of this bylaw are strictly observed and followed.

 



25\. (i) The foregoing right of first refusal shall terminate upon the date
securities of the corporation are first offered to the public pursuant to a
registration statement filed with, and declared effective by, the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended.

 

(j) The certificates representing shares of stock of the corporation shall
bear on their face the following legend so long as the foregoing right of
first refusal remains in effect:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A RIGHT OF
FIRST REFUSAL OPTION IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY AND/OR ITS ASSIGNEE(S), AS
PROVIDED IN THE BYLAWS OF THE COMPANY."

LOANS TO OFFICERS

 

Section 47\. Loans to Officers. Except as otherwise prohibited under
applicable law, the corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any
obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee of the
corporation or of its subsidiaries, including any officer or employee who is a
director of the corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment of
the Board of Directors, such loan, guarantee or assistance may reasonably be
expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guarantee or other assistance
may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such
manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without
limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in these
Bylaws shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or
warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.

ARTICLE XVI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Section 48\. Annual Report.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Bylaw, the Board of
Directors shall cause an annual report to be sent to each stockholder of the
corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of
the corporations fiscal year. Such report shall include a balance sheet as of
the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes
in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report thereon
of independent accountants or, if there is no such report, the certificate of
an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared
without audit from the books and records of the corporation. When there are
more than one hundred (100) stockholders of record of the corporations
shares, as determined by Section 605 of the CGCL, additional information
as required by Section 1501(b) of the CGCL shall also be contained in such
report, provided that if the corporation has a class of securities registered
under Section 12 of the 1934 Act, the 1934 Act shall take precedence. Such
report shall be sent to stockholders at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
next annual meeting of stockholders after the end of the fiscal year to which
it relates.

 



26\. (b) If and so long as there are fewer than one hundred (100) holders of record
of the corporations shares, the requirement of sending an annual report to
the stockholders of the corporation is hereby expressly waived.
