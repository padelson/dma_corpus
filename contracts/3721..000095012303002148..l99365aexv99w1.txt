56    iii   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER, dated as of February 17, 2003 (this "AGREEMENT"), by and among Andrew
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), Adirondacks, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("SUB"), and Allen
Telecom Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY").   WHEREAS, the Boards
of Directors of Parent and Sub and the Company deem it advisable and in the
best interests of their respective stockholders that Parent acquire the
Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and, in
furtherance of such acquisition, such Boards of Directors (and Parent as the
sole stockholder of Sub) have approved this Agreement and the merger of the
Company with and into Sub in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"); and  
WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE").   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:   ARTICLE I.   THE MERGER   Section 1.1. The Merger.
In accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the DGCL, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2), the Company shall be merged with
and into Sub (the "Merger"), the separate existence of the Company shall
thereupon cease, and Sub shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter called the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue
its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL. At Parent\'s
option, the Merger may be structured so that (i) any direct Subsidiary of
Parent other than Sub is merged with and into the Company or (ii) the
Company is merged with and into Parent or any direct Subsidiary of Parent. In
the event of such an election by Parent, the parties hereto agree to execute
an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
election.   Section 1.2. Effective Time of the Merger. The Merger shall
become effective at the time of filing of a properly executed Certificate of
Merger in the form required by and executed in accordance with the provisions
of the DGCL. The parties to this Agreement shall cause such filing to be made
simultaneously with the Closing (as defined in Section 1.3). When used in
this  Agreement, the term "EFFECTIVE TIME" shall mean the date and time at
which the Merger shall become effective.   Section 1.3. Closing. The
closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing")
shall take place at the offices of Gardner Carton and Douglas LLC, 191 N.
Wacker Drive, Suite 3700, Chicago, Illinois, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on
the day on which all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (excluding
conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date,
but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) are satisfied
or waived (subject to applicable law) or on such other date and at such other
time and place as Parent and the Company shall agree (such date, the "CLOSING
DATE").   ARTICLE II.   THE SURVIVING CORPORATION   Section 2.1.
Certificate of Incorporation. The Certificate of Incorporation of Sub in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with applicable law, except
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Allen Telecom Inc."  
Section 2.2. By-Laws. The By-Laws of Sub as in effect at the Effective Time
shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance
with applicable law.   Section 2.3. Directors and Officers of Surviving
Corporation.   (a) The directors of Sub at the Effective Time shall be
the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, and each shall hold
office from the Effective Time until his respective successor is duly elected
or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation or as otherwise
provided by law.   (b) The officers as set forth on Exhibit A shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, and each shall hold office
until his respective successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified in
the manner provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by law.   Section 2.4.
Directors and Officers of Parent. The directors of Parent at the Effective
Time shall continue as the directors of Parent after the Effective Time;
except that Parent shall cause the number of directors serving on its board
to be increased to twelve (12) and cause Philip Wm. Colburn and Robert G.
Paul to be elected to the board to hold office from the period commencing one
(1) business day after the Effective Time until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Parent or as otherwise provided by
law.    2   Section 2.5. Certificate of Incorporation of Parent. At the
Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of Parent shall be amended
and restated substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the "AMENDED AND
RESTATED CHARTER").   ARTICLE III.   CONVERSION OF SHARES   Section 3.1.
Exchange Ratio. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof:   (a) Each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 3.1(f)) shall be
converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock, par
value, $.01 per share of Parent (the "PARENT COMMON STOCK"), equal to 1.775
(the "EXCHANGE RATIO"), payable upon the surrender of the certificate (or a
lost security affidavit in form satisfactory to Parent) formerly representing
such share of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 3.2 hereof.  
(b) Each outstanding share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share ("SUB
COMMON STOCK"), of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.   (c) Each outstanding share of Series D 7.75%
Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, no par value per share (the
"COMPANY PREFERRED STOCK"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section
3.1(f)) shall be converted into the right to receive one share of Series A
7.75% Convertible Preferred Stock of Parent, no par value per share ("PARENT
PREFERRED STOCK"), authorized pursuant to the Amended and Restated Charter,
payable immediately upon the surrender of the certificate (or a lost security
affidavit in form satisfactory to Parent) formerly representing such share of
Company Preferred Stock in accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement.
Shares of Parent Preferred Stock shall have, in respect of Parent, the same
powers, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special
rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereon as the
shares of Company Preferred Stock had in respect of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all
corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of
shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon conversion of the Parent
Preferred Stock.   (d) As a result of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock shall cease to be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of Company Common Stock ("COMMON CERTIFICATES")
or of Company Preferred Stock ("PREFERRED CERTIFICATES" and together with the
Common Certificates,   3  the "CERTIFICATES") shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, respectively, except as provided herein or by
law.   (e) Each outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock (each,
a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") shall be assumed or otherwise provided for
by Parent as more specifically provided in Section 7.8.   (f) All shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that, in either case, are
(i) held by the Company as treasury shares or (ii) owned by Parent or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and retired and cease to
exist, and no securities of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered
in exchange therefor. As used in this Agreement, the term "SUBSIDIARY" means,
with respect to any party, any corporation or other organization, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which (1) such party or any other
Subsidiary of such party is a general partner excluding partnerships, the
general partnership interests of which held by such party or any Subsidiary
of such party do not have a majority of the voting interest in such
partnership or (2) at least a majority of the securities or other interests
having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board
of directors or others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization that is directly or indirectly owned
or controlled by such party and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries.  
Section 3.2. Exchange of Company Stock; Procedures.   (a) Prior to the
Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as Exchange Agent hereunder (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT"). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with or for the account of the Exchange Agent stock certificates
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, which shares of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been issued
at the Effective Time. Parent agrees to make available directly or indirectly
to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 3.4 and any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 3.3.   (b) Promptly
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate that was converted pursuant to Section
3.1 into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Preferred Stock, as the case may be (i) a form of letter of transmittal (such
letter to be reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective
Time) specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering such
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of
Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common  
4  Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, which such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III, (y)
a check in an amount equal to the cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.4,
after giving effect to any required tax withholdings, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled and (z) any dividends or
distributions to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.3.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be may be issued to a
transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 3.2(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender a certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock or
Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, cash in lieu of any fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions, which may
be payable pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof.   Section 3.3. Dividends;
Escheat. No dividends or distributions that are declared on shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be will be paid to
persons entitled to receive certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be until such persons
surrender their Certificates. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the
person in whose name the certificates representing such shares of Parent
Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be shall be issued,
any dividends or distributions with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock or Parent Preferred Stock, as the case may be which have a record date
on or after the Effective Time and shall have become payable between the
Effective Time and the time of such surrender. In no event shall the
person entitled to receive such dividends or distributions be entitled to
receive interest thereon. Promptly following the date which is six months
after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the Surviving
Corporation all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession
relating to the transactions described in this Agreement; and any holders of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this Article III shall look thereafter only to the Surviving
Corporation for the shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, any dividends or distributions thereon and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares thereof to which they are entitled pursuant to this
Article III. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock for any shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, any dividends or distributions thereon
or any cash in lieu of fractional shares thereof delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
laws.   Section 3.4. No Fractional Securities. No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent
Preferred Stock, as the case may be shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, and such fractional interests shall not entitle
the   5  owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a security holder. In
lieu of any such fractional securities, each holder of Company Common Stock
who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock upon surrender of such holder\'s Certificates will be entitled
to receive a cash payment (without interest) determined by multiplying (i)
the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held of
record by such holder) and (ii) the average of the per share closing prices
for Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Market ("NNM") for the five
(5) trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time. As promptly as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify
Parent, and Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to
deposit, such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange
Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to
and in accordance with the terms hereof.   Section 3.5. Closing of Company
Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article III.   Section 3.6.
Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of Sub or the Company acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of each of Sub and the Company or otherwise, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in such
names and on such behalves or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement.   Section 3.7. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a
bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
or Parent Preferred Stock to which such person is entitled pursuant to
Section 3.1 with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, formerly represented thereby, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.4, and unpaid dividends and distributions on
shares of Parent Common Stock or Parent Preferred Stock to which such holders
are entitled pursuant to this Agreement.    6   Section 3.8. Withholding
Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred
Stock, Company Stock Options or any other equity rights in the Company such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be.   ARTICLE IV.   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Parent
and Sub as follows:   Section 4.1. Corporate Organization; Related
Entities.   (a) The Company and each Subsidiary of the Company which
would be required to be set forth on an exhibit to the Company\'s Annual
Report on Form 10-K pursuant to the rules and regulations under the Exchange
Act (each of which is identified on Schedule 4.1(a)) (each, a "COMPANY
SUBSIDIARY") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and to carry on
its business as it is presently being conducted. Schedule 4.1(a) lists, and
the Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing in, every
jurisdiction where the character of the Company\'s or the Company
Subsidiary\'s properties (owned or leased) or the nature of its activities
makes such qualification or licensure necessary, except for failures, if any,
to be so qualified or licensed, which in the aggregate have not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
hereinafter defined).   (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 4.1(b), the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of any
corporation or have any direct or indirect equity or ownership interest of
any kind in any business, joint venture, partnership or other entity. Except
as set forth on Schedule 4.1(b) and for qualifying shares required by certain
foreign jurisdictions, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries has been validly issued, is fully paid
and nonassessable and is owned of record and beneficially, directly or
indirectly, by the Company, free of any Liens, preemptive rights or other
restrictions with respect thereto.   (c) The copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-Laws or other comparable governing documents of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary   7  heretofore made available to
Parent are complete and correct copies of such instruments as presently in
effect.   (d) "MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE" or "MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means,
when used in connection with any person, (i) any change, effect,
event, occurrence or state of facts that, after considering any insurance
coverage, the applicability of which has been assured, in writing, by the
insurer, which must be financially sound, and any reserves provided for in
such person\'s financial statements is, or would reasonably be expected to
be, materially adverse to the business, operations, assets (including
intangible assets), liabilities (including contingent liabilities), financial
condition or results of operations of such person and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, other than any change, effect, event or occurrence (A) relating
to the economy of the United States or any other region in general (which
changes, effects, events or occurrences do not disproportionately affect such
person) or (B) resulting from entering into this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the announcement
thereof, or (ii) any change, effect, event, occurrence or state of facts that
could reasonably be expected to materially impair or delay the ability of
such person to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and the terms
"MATERIAL" and "MATERIALLY" (other than as used in this 00), have correlative
meanings; provided that any change in the price of the common stock of a
person shall not be deemed by itself to constitute a "Material
Adverse Change" or "Material Adverse Effect." A "Material Adverse Change" or
"Material Adverse Effect" when used in connection with the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be referred to herein as a "Company Material Adverse
Change" or a "Company Material Adverse Effect," as the case may be, and a
"Material Adverse Change" or "Material Adverse Effect" when used in
connection with Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be referred to herein as a
"Parent Material Adverse Change" or a "Parent Material Adverse Effect," as

"COMPANY PLANS") or with respect to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
of the Company has any liability. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
of the Company has any formal plan or commitment to create any additional
plan or modify any existing Company Plan, except for such modifications that
are required by law.   (b) Each of the Company Plans that is subject to
ERISA is in compliance with ERISA, except for any failures to be in such
compliance that individually or in the aggregate have not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; each of the
Company Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a)
of the Code is so qualified, no event has occurred which may affect such
qualification and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code, except as has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; no Company
Plan has an accumulated or waived funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code, except as has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate of the Company has incurred, directly or indirectly, any
liability to or on account of a   18  Company Plan pursuant to Title IV of
ERISA, except for such liability or liabilities that individually or in the
aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect; no proceedings have been instituted to terminate any
Company Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA; no "reportable event," as
such term is defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, has occurred with respect
to any Company Plan, except for any such reportable event that occurred more
than three years before the date of this Agreement; and no condition exists
that presents a material risk to the Company or an ERISA Affiliate of the
Company of incurring a liability to or on account of a Company Plan pursuant
to Title IV of ERISA, except for such conditions which individually or in the
aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.   (c) There are no facts or circumstances that
would materially change the funded status of any Company Plan that is a
"defined benefit" plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) since the date
of the most recent actuarial report for such plan, each of which reports has
been provided to Parent. No Company Plan is a multiemployer plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) and no Company Plan is a multiple employer
plan as defined in Section 413 of the Code. Except for contributions or
amounts which either individually or in the aggregate have not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all
contributions or other amounts payable by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time with respect to each Company Plan in
respect of current or prior plan years have been either paid or accrued on
the consolidated balance sheet of the Company. There are no pending,
threatened or anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by,
on behalf of or against any of the Company Plans or any trusts related
thereto, except for such claims which individually or in the aggregate have
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   (d) Neither the Company, nor any ERISA Affiliate of
the Company, nor any Company Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any
trustee or administrator thereof has incurred any liability pursuant to
Section 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, that, in
either case, individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No amounts payable under
the Company Plans will, individually or in the aggregate, fail to be
deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the
Code. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.16, no Company Plan provides death or
medical benefits (whether or not insured), with respect to current or former
employees of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company beyond their
retirement or other termination of service the cost of which is material to
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries taken as a whole other than (i)
coverage mandated by applicable law or (ii) death benefits under any
"employee pension plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA.
Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.16, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former
employee or officer of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company to
severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as
expressly provided in this Agreement or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee or officer.   19   (e) All Company Plans comply in form and
operation, and the Company and each ERISA Affiliate of the Company have
complied with respect to the Company Plans, with all applicable Laws, except
where the failure to comply has not had and could not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.17. Permits. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has, and is in material compliance with,
all Permits required to conduct its respective business as now being
conducted, except any such Permit the absence of which, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect ("MATERIAL PERMITS"). All the Material
Permits are valid and in full force and effect. There is not now pending, nor
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, any Action (as hereafter
defined) by any person or by or before any Governmental Entity to revoke,
cancel, rescind, modify or refuse to renew any the Material Permits and, to
the knowledge of the Company, there exist no facts or circumstances
that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Action. "PERMITS"
means all licenses, permits, franchises, approvals, authorizations,
certificates, registrations, consents or orders of, or filings with, any
Governmental Entity used or held for use in the operation of the Company and
its Subsidiaries\' respective businesses and all other rights and privileges
granted by a Governmental Entity necessary to allow the Company and its
Subsidiaries\' respective businesses to own and operate its business without
any violation of law.   Section 4.18. Compliance with Law. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated, and the Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is in compliance with, all laws, statutes, ordinances,
regulations, rules and orders of any Governmental Entity, and any judgment,
decision, decree or order of any Governmental Entity (collectively, "LAWS")
other than where such violation has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice to the effect that
the Company and its Subsidiaries are not in such compliance with any Laws,
and the Company has no knowledge that any existing circumstances are
reasonably likely to result in such violations of any Laws.   Section 4.19.
Vote Required. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER
APPROVAL") is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Company\'s capital stock necessary to approve the Merger. The Board
of Directors of the Company (at a meeting duly called and held) has
unanimously (i) approved this Agreement, (ii) determined that the
transactions contemplated hereby are in the best interests of the holders of
Company Common Stock, (iii) determined to recommend this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby to such holders for
approval and adoption, and (iv) recommended that the Company\'s stockholders
adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 4.20. Opinion of Financial Advisor. The
Company has received the opinion of Bear, Stearns and Co. Inc. ("BEAR
STEARNS"), dated the date hereof, substantially to the effect that the
consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of Company Common
Stock is fair to such holders from a financial point of view.   20  
Section 4.21. Affiliate Transactions. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports, there are no material Contracts or other transactions between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any (i) officer or
director of the Company, (ii) record or beneficial owner of five percent or
more of the voting securities of the Company or (iii) affiliate (as such term
is defined in Regulation 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of any
such officer, director or beneficial owner, on the other hand.   Section
4.22. Brokers. Except for its financial advisor, Bear Stearns, no broker,
finder or financial advisor is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other
fee or commission in connection with the Merger or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   Section 4.23.
Reorganization. To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action that (without giving
effect to any actions taken or agreed to be taken by Parent or any of its
affiliates) would prevent the Merger from constituting a "reorganization,"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   Section 4.24. Contracts.
Schedule 4.24 lists, as of the date of this Agreement, all Contracts to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and that fall within any of
the following categories:   (a) Contracts not entered into in the ordinary
course of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' business other than those
that are not material to the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' business;  
(b) joint venture, partnership and similar agreements;   (c) Contracts
containing covenants purporting by their express terms to limit the freedom
of the Company or its Subsidiaries to compete in any line of business in any
geographic area or to hire any individual or group of individuals;   (d)
Contracts that, after the Effective Time, would have the effect of limiting
the freedom of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to compete in any line of business in any geographic area or to
hire any individual or group of individuals;   (e) Contracts with any labor
organization or union;   (f) Contracts providing for "earn-outs," "savings

wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Company) or other contingent payments by the
Company or its Subsidiaries involving more than $50,000 over the term of the
Contract; and   (g) Contracts involving payments to or by the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or which are reasonably likely to result
in the incurrence by the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
of liabilities, of at least $5,000,000 per year.   21   All such
Contracts are valid and binding obligations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
the valid and binding obligation of each other party thereto, except such
Contracts that, if not so valid and binding, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company or its Subsidiaries,
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, is in
violation of or in default in respect of, nor has there occurred an event or
condition, that with the passage of time or giving of notice (or both), would
constitute a default under or permit the termination of, any such Contract
except such violations or defaults under or terminations that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.25. Operation of the
Company\'s Business; Relationships. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.25,
since September 30, 2002, to the knowledge of the Company, no material
customer of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has indicated that

services from the Company or its Subsidiaries, and no material supplier of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has indicated that it will

the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or, in either case, is otherwise
involved in, or is threatening, a material dispute with the Company or its
Subsidiaries.   Section 4.26. Change in Control Payments. Except as set
forth on Schedule 4.26, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any plans, programs, agreements or arrangements to which it is a party, or to
which it is subject, pursuant to which payments (or acceleration of benefits)
may be required upon, or may become payable directly or indirectly as a
result of, the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.27. Insurance.
Schedule 4.27 lists all material insurance policies and binders and programs
of self-insurance owned, held or maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement that afford or afforded, as the
case may be, coverage to the Company or its Subsidiaries, or the respective
assets or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company and its
Subsidiaries\' insurance policies are in all material respects in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, no notice of cancellation has been
received, and there is no existing default or event that, with the giving of
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default thereunder. The
Company has made available to Parent true and correct copies of all material
insurance policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date of this Agreement.   ARTICLE V.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
PARENT AND SUB   22  Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company

under the laws of the State of Delaware and has the corporate power to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted or presently proposed to be
conducted. Parent is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business,
and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its
properties owned or held under lease or the nature of its activities make
such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified has
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect (as hereinafter defined). Sub is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Sub has not engaged in any business (other than in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) since the date

a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of organization or incorporation and has the

heretofore made available to the Company are complete and correct copies of
such instruments as presently in effect.   Section 5.2. Capitalization.

the transactions contemplated on their part hereby have been duly authorized
by their respective Boards of Directors, and by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Sub, and, except for the approval of Parent\'s stockholders to
be sought at the stockholders\' meeting contemplated by 0, no other

contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Sub and constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against Parent and Sub in

Violations. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
by Parent or Sub, nor the consummation by Parent or Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provisions of (x) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of Parent or of
Sub or (y) the organizational documents of the Parent Subsidiaries, (ii)

any Governmental Entity except in connection with or in order to comply with

under, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, or result in the creation
of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or any other of the Parent
Subsidiaries pursuant to, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
material Contract to which Parent or Sub or any other Parent Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of them or any of their properties or assets may be
bound or (iv) violate any law, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule
or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Parent, Sub or any
other Parent Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets, except, in the
case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), where the failure to make such
filing or obtain such authorization, consent or approval could not reasonably
be expected to have, or where such violations, breaches or defaults or Liens
could not reasonably be expected to have, in any such case, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.5. Reports and Financial Statements. Parent has
timely filed all reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act since September 30, 1998 (collectively,
the "PARENT SEC REPORTS"), and has previously made available to the Company
true and complete copies of all such Parent SEC Reports. Such Parent SEC
Reports, as of their respective dates, complied in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and none of such SEC Reports contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods indicated
(except as otherwise noted therein or, in the case of unaudited statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to normal, recurring year-end adjustments and
any other adjustments described therein) the consolidated financial position

consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods then ended. Except as disclosed in

provisions of Section 6.2 and (ii) there has not been any fact, event,
circumstance or change affecting or relating to Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.6 or as could not
reasonably be expected to represent a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not constitute a change of
control under or require the consent from or the giving of notice to a third
party pursuant to the terms, conditions or provisions of any Contract to
which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party.   Section 5.7. Litigation.
Except for litigation disclosed in the notes to the financial statements

pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or with respect to which Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent could be required to provide indemnification or to otherwise
contribute to liabilities or damages relating thereto, the outcome of which
has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect; nor is there any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order
of any Governmental Entity outstanding against Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent having, or which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.8. Absence of Undisclosed
Liabilities. Except for liabilities or obligations which are accrued or

reflected in a consolidated balance sheet (or reflected in the notes thereto)
or which have had or could reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.9. No Default. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is in breach or violation, or in default under (and no event has
occurred which with notice or the lapse of time or both would constitute such
a breach, default or violation) of any term, condition or provision of (a)
Parent\'s Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws or (b) (x) any order, writ,
decree, statute, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to
Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or any of their properties or assets or (y)

any Subsidiary of Parent has participated in, or cooperated with, an

any license or agreement between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and any
third party; or, to the knowledge of Parent based, in part, on
representations and warranties from third parties from whom Intellectual
Property is licensed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, infringe on the
proprietary rights of any person, nor has such an infringement been alleged
within three years preceding the date of this Agreement (other than such as
have been resolved). There is no pending or threatened claim or litigation
challenging or questioning the validity, ownership or right to use, sell,
license or dispose of any Intellectual Property in the manner in which
currently used, sold, licensed or disposed of by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor is there a valid basis for any such claim or litigation,
nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries received any notice asserting that
the proposed operation of Parent\'s and its Subsidiaries\' respective
businesses or the use, sale, license or disposition by Parent of any of the
Intellectual Property of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries conflicts or will
conflict with the rights of any other party, nor is there a valid basis
for any such assertion in each case, with such exceptions as in the aggregate
have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 5.12. Environmental Liability.   (a) At all
times prior to the Closing, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has complied
in all respects with all Environmental Laws, except where the failure to
comply has not had or could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice, report, or information (including information that any
Action of any kind is pending or threatened) regarding any liabilities
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent, unliquidated, or otherwise), or any
corrective, investigatory or remedial obligations, arising
under Environmental Laws relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
the occupation or use of any of Parent\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' assets
or any real properties formerly owned or leased by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. Parent or one of its Subsidiaries holds all Material Parent
Permits under Environmental Laws necessary for the conduct of Parent\'s and
its Subsidiaries\' business as presently being conducted, and such Material
Parent Permits are valid and in full force and effect.   (b) No Hazardous
Materials have been, or are currently, located at, in, or under or emanating
from either any property currently or previously owned or operated by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in a manner which violates in any respect any
applicable Environmental Laws, except for such violations as in the aggregate
have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   29       Section 5.13. Section 203 of the DCGL;
Stockholder Rights Plan.   (a) Other than that certain Rights Agreement
dated as of November 14, 1996, by and between Parent and Harris Trust and
Savings Bank Company of New York (the "PARENT RIGHTS AGREEMENT"), Parent has
not proposed, adopted, approved or implemented any Stockholder Rights Plan,
which could have the effect of restricting, prohibiting, impeding or
otherwise affecting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the parties thereto.   (b) Prior to the date of this Agreement,
the Board of Directors of Parent has taken all action, if any, necessary to
exempt under, or make not subject to, (i) the provisions of Section 203 of
the DGCL and (ii) any other state takeover law or state law that purports to
limit or restrict business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote
shares: (A) the execution of this Agreement, (B) the Merger and (C) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No "Stock Acquisition Date" or
"Distribution Date" (as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement) and
no event allowing bargain purchases will occur as a result of the execution
of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement.   Section 5.14. Information in Disclosure Documents and
Registration Statement. None of the information to be supplied by Parent or
Sub for inclusion in (i) the Registration Statement or (ii) the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus will in the case of the Registration Statement, at the
time it becomes effective and at the Effective Time, or, in the case of the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus or any amendments thereof or supplements thereto,
at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and any
amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the meeting of
stockholders of Parent to be held in connection with the Merger, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, except that no representation is made by
Parent with respect to statements made therein based on information supplied
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their representatives for
inclusion in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or
with respect to information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus.   Section 5.15. Employees. The Parent has provided or
made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies of all
employment or severance or termination agreements, policies, plans,
commitments or other Contracts, whether written or oral, accruing to the
benefit of any officer or director of the Company. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contracts with any labor union or employee
association nor has Parent or any of its Subsidiaries conducted negotiations
with any labor union or employee association with respect to any future
contracts. Parent is not aware of any current attempts to organize or
establish any labor union or employee association with respect to any
employees of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,    30   and there is no
existing or pending certification of any such union with regard to a
bargaining unit.   Section 5.16. Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.   (a)
Schedule 5.16 hereto sets forth a true and complete list of each employee
benefit plan, arrangement or agreement that is maintained or contributed to
by Parent or the Sub or by any ERISA Affiliate of Parent (the "PARENT PLANS")
or with respect to which Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent has any
liability. Neither Parent nor any ERISA Affiliate of Parent has any formal
plan or commitment to create any additional plan or modify any
existing Parent Plan, except for such modifications that are required by
law.   (b) Each of the Parent Plans that is subject to ERISA is
in compliance with ERISA, except for any failures to be in such compliance
that individually or in the aggregate have not had and could not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; each of the Parent
Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code is so qualified, no event has occurred which may affect such
qualification and the trusts maintained thereunder are exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Code, except as has not had and could not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; no Parent
Plan has an accumulated or waived funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 412 of the Code, except as has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; neither Parent nor any
ERISA Affiliate of Parent has incurred, directly or indirectly, any liability
to or on account of a Parent Plan pursuant to Title IV of ERISA, except for
such liability or liabilities that individually or in the aggregate have not
had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect; no proceedings have been instituted to terminate any Parent Plan that
is subject to Title IV of ERISA; no "reportable event," as such term is
defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA, has occurred with respect to any Parent
Plan, except for any such reportable event that occurred more than
three years before the date of this Agreement; and no condition exists that
presents a material risk to Parent or an ERISA Affiliate of Parent of
incurring a liability to or on account of a Parent Plan pursuant to Title IV
of ERISA, except for such conditions which individually or in the aggregate
have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   (c) There are no facts or circumstances that would
materially change the funded status of any Parent Plan that is a "defined
benefit" plan (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) since the date of the
most recent actuarial report for such plan. No Parent Plan is a multiemployer
plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA) and no Parent Plan is a
multiple employer plan as defined in Section 413 of the Code. Except for
contributions or amounts which either individually or in the aggregate have
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect, all contributions or other amounts payable by Parent or the
Sub as of the Effective Time with respect to each Parent Plan in respect of
current or prior plan years have been either paid or accrued on the
consolidated balance sheet of Parent. There are no pending, threatened or
anticipated claims (other than routine claims for benefits) by, on behalf of
or against any of the Parent Plans or any trusts related thereto, except for
such claims    31   which individually or in the aggregate have not had
and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect.   (d) Neither Parent, nor any ERISA Affiliate of Parent, nor
any Parent Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor any trustee or
administrator thereof has incurred any liability pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code, that, in either case,
individually or in the aggregate has had or could reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No amounts payable under the Parent
Plans will, individually or in the aggregate, fail to be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code. No Parent
Plan provides death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with
respect to current or former employees of Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of
Parent beyond their retirement or other termination of service the cost of
which is material to Parent and Sub taken as a whole other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable law or (ii) death benefits under any "employee pension
plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA. Except as disclosed
on Schedule 5.16, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (i) entitle any current or former employee or officer of
Parent or any ERISA Affiliate of Parent to severance pay, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the
amount of compensation due any such employee or officer.   (e) All Parent
Plans comply in form and operation, and Parent and each ERISA Affiliate of
Parent have complied with respect to the Parent Plans, with all applicable
Laws, except where the failure to comply has not had and could not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.17.
Permits. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has, and is in material
compliance with, all Permits required to conduct its respective business as
now being conducted, except any such Permit the absence of
which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and could not reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect ("MATERIAL PARENT
PERMITS"). All the Material Parent Permits are valid and in full force and
effect. There is not now pending, nor to the knowledge of Parent, threatened,
any Action by any person or by or before any Governmental Entity to revoke,
cancel, rescind, modify or refuse to renew any of the Material Parent Permits
and, to the knowledge of Parent, there exist no facts or circumstances that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to such Action.   Section 5.18.
Compliance with Law. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has violated,
and Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with, all Laws,
other than where such violation has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any written notice to the effect that Parent
and its Subsidiaries are not in such compliance with any Laws, and Parent has
no knowledge that any existing circumstances are reasonably likely to result
in such violations of any Laws.   Section 5.19. Vote Required. The
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Parent Common
Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the stockholders   
32   meeting of Parent contemplated by Section 7.5(b) (provided that the
shares so present or represented constitute a majority of the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock) is the only vote of the holders of any class
or series of Parent\'s capital stock necessary to approve the issuance of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to the
Merger (the "SHARE ISSUANCE"), and the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of Parent\'s capital stock necessary to
approve the adoption of the Amended and Restated Charter (the "CHARTER
AMENDMENT") (collectively, the "PARENT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"). The
affirmative vote of Parent, as the sole stockholder of all outstanding shares
of Sub Common Stock, is the only vote of the holders of any class or series
of Sub capital stock necessary to approve the Merger. The Board of Directors
of Parent (at a meeting duly called and held) has unanimously (i) approved
this Agreement, (ii) determined that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fair to and in the best interests of Parent and the holders of Parent Common
Stock, (iii) determined to cause Parent, as the sole stockholder of Sub, to
approve and adopt this Agreement, and (iv) recommended that
Parent\'s stockholders approve the Share Issuance and the Charter Amendment.
The Board of Directors of Sub (by unanimous written consent) has approved
this Agreement.   Section 5.20. Opinion of Financial Advisor. Parent has
received the opinion of Morgan Stanley and Co. Incorporated ("MORGAN STANLEY"),
dated the date hereof, substantially to the effect that the consideration to
be paid by Parent pursuant to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to Parent.   Section
5.21. Affiliate Transactions. Except as disclosed in Parent SEC Reports,
there are no material Contracts or other transactions between Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any (i) officer or director
of Parent, (ii) record or beneficial owner of five percent or more of the
voting securities of Parent or (iii) affiliate (as such term is defined in
Regulation 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of any such officer,
director or beneficial owner, on the other hand.   Section 5.22. Brokers.
Except for its financial advisor, Morgan Stanley, no broker, finder or
financial advisor is entitled to any brokerage, finder\'s or other fee or
commission in connection with the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries.   Section 5.23. Reorganization. To the knowledge of
Parent, neither Parent nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action that (without giving effect to any actions taken or agreed to be
taken by the Company or any of its affiliates) would prevent the Merger from
constituting a "reorganization," within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.   Section 5.24. Contracts. All material Contracts of Parent and
its Subsidiaries are valid and binding obligations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge of Parent, the valid
and binding obligation of each other party thereto, except such Contracts
that, if not so valid and binding, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent or its    33   Subsidiaries, nor, to the
knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto, is in violation of or in
default in respect of, nor has there occurred an event or condition, that
with the passage of time or giving of notice (or both), would constitute a
default under or permit the termination of, any such Contract, except such
violations or defaults under or terminations that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.   Section 5.25. Change in Control Payments. Neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements to which it is a party, or to which it is subject, pursuant to
which payments (or acceleration of benefits) may be required upon, or may
become payable directly or indirectly as a result of, the transactions
contemplated hereby.   Section 5.26. Operation of Parent\'s Business;
Relationships. Since September 30, 2002, to the knowledge of Parent, no
material customer of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has indicated
that it will stop or materially decrease purchasing materials, products or
services from Parent or its Subsidiaries, and no material supplier of Parent
or any of the Parent Subsidiaries has indicated that it will stop or
materially decrease the supply of materials, products or services to Parent
or the Parent Subsidiaries or, in either case, is otherwise involved in, or
is threatening, a material dispute with Parent or its Subsidiaries.  
Section 5.27. Insurance. Schedule 5.27 lists all material insurance policies
and binders and programs of self-insurance owned, held or maintained
by Parent and its Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement that afford
or afforded, as the case may be, coverage to Parent or its Subsidiaries, or
the respective assets or businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries. Parent and
its Subsidiaries\' insurance policies are in all material respects in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, no notice of cancellation
has been received, and there is no existing default or event that, with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default
thereunder. Parent has made available to the Company true and correct copies
of all material insurance policies maintained by Parent and its Subsidiaries
as of the date of this Agreement.   ARTICLE VI.   CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

other representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to all of its books
and records (other than privileged documents and subject to any
confidentiality provisions applicable to communications between any party and
its counsel) and its properties, plants and personnel and, during such
period, each shall furnish promptly to the other a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or received by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal securities laws, provided that no investigation
pursuant to this Section 7.1 shall affect any representations or warranties

that it (and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective representatives)
shall hold in confidence all non-public information so acquired in accordance
with the terms of the confidentiality agreement, dated August 9, 2002,
between Parent and the Company (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").   Section
7.2. No Solicitation by Parent.   (a) Parent shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its
directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit,
initiate or encourage    37   (including by way of furnishing
information), or take any other action designed to facilitate or induce, any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes any Parent Takeover
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Parent Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that, if at any time, the Board
of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties to Parent\'s stockholders
under applicable law, Parent may, in response to a Parent Superior Proposal,
or a Parent Takeover Proposal with respect to which the Board of Directors of
Parent concludes in good faith there is a reasonable likelihood that such
Parent Takeover Proposal could result in a Parent Superior Proposal (a
"PROBABLE PARENT SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"), that was not solicited by it or that
did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.2(a) and subject to
providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action to the
Company and compliance with Section 7.2(c), (x) furnish the same information
with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries as was previously furnished to
the Company, as revised or updated to reflect any changes or additions to
such information (provided that such revised information is contemporaneously
furnished to Company to the extent it had not been previously so furnished),
to any person making a Parent Superior Proposal or a Probable Parent Superior
Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (as determined by
Parent after consultation with its outside counsel) that is no less
restrictive in any material respect than the Confidentiality Agreement and
(y) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such Parent Superior
Proposal or a Probable Parent Superior Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, "PARENT TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any person relating to any (w) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net
income or the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (x)
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of Parent or of 50% or more of any class of
equity securities of any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15%
or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of Parent or 50% or more of any class of equity
securities of any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more
of the net revenues, net income or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (z) merger, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues,
net income or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall
immediately terminate, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, or other representatives to immediately terminate, all
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third party with respect to a
Parent Takeover Proposal.   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this
Section 7.2(b) or Section 7.5(b), neither the Board of Directors of Parent
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly
to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Company, Parent Recommendation
or, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
any Parent Takeover Proposal, (iii) permit Parent to waive or otherwise fail
to enforce any    38   standstill agreement or similar arrangement
between Parent and any other person, or (iv) cause Parent to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement (each, a "PARENT ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to any
Parent Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that in light of a Parent Superior Proposal it is
necessary to do so in order to act in a manner consistent with its fiduciary
duties to Parent\'s stockholders under applicable law, the Board of Directors
of Parent may (subject to this and the following sentences) terminate this
Agreement in order to concurrently enter into such Parent Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Parent Superior Proposal; provided, however, that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.2(b)
unless and until (i) three business days have elapsed following the delivery
to the Company of a written notice of such determination by the Board of
Directors of Parent and (x) Parent has delivered to the Company the written
notice required by Section 7.2(c) below and (y) during such three business
day period, Parent otherwise cooperates with Company with respect to the
Parent Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal with the
intent of enabling the Company to engage in good faith negotiations to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of the Merger as would
enable Parent to proceed with the Merger on such adjusted terms, (ii) at the
end of such three business day period the Board of Directors of Parent
continues reasonably to believe that the Parent Takeover Proposal constitutes
a Parent Superior Proposal and (iii) Parent pays the Parent Termination Fee
as provided in Section 9.5. For purposes of this Agreement, a "PARENT
SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide written proposal made by a third party
to acquire, directly or indirectly, including pursuant to a tender offer,
exchange offer, merger, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, more than 30% of the combined voting power of the shares
of Parent Common Stock then outstanding or more than 40% of the assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions and otherwise on terms which the Board of
Directors of Parent determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more
favorable to Parent\'s stockholders than the Merger (after considering (1)
any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposal by Company
in response to a Parent Takeover Proposal and (2) the Parent Termination Fee)
and (i) for which financing, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of Parent, is reasonably capable of being obtained by such third
party and (ii) which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
Parent, is reasonably likely of being completed.   (c) In addition to the
obligations of Parent set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section
7.2, Parent shall immediately advise the Company orally and in writing of any
request for information or of any Parent Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request or Parent Takeover Proposal and the
identity of the person making such request or Parent Takeover Proposal.
Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed of the status and details
(including amendments and proposed amendments) of any such request or Parent
Takeover Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 prohibits
Parent from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under    39   the Exchange Act or from
making any disclosure to Parent\'s stockholders if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent, after consultation with outside
counsel, failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under applicable law; provided, however, that, except as expressly permitted
by paragraph (b) of this Section 7.2 in connection with a Parent Superior
Proposal, neither Parent nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
will withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
its position with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve or recommend, a Parent Takeover Proposal.   Section
7.3. No Solicitation by the Company.   (a) The Company shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any of
its directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial
advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any
of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly through another person, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage (including by way of furnishing information),
or take any other action designed to facilitate or induce, any inquiries or
the making of any proposal that constitutes any Company Takeover Proposal or
(ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Company
Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that, if at any time, the Board of
Directors of Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to act in a manner
consistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under
applicable law, Company may, in response to a Company Superior Proposal, or a
Company Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
concludes in good faith that there is a reasonable likelihood that such
Company Takeover Proposal could result in a Company Superior Proposal
(a "PROBABLE COMPANY SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"), that was not solicited by it or
that did not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.3(a) and
subject to providing prior written notice of its decision to take such action
to Parent and compliance with Section 7.3(c), (x) furnish the same
information with respect to Company and its Subsidiaries as was previously
furnished to Parent, as revised or updated to reflect any changes or
additions to such information (provided that such revised information is
contemporaneously furnished to Parent to the extent it had not been
previously so furnished), to any person making a Company Superior Proposal or
a Probable Company Superior Proposal pursuant to a customary confidentiality
agreement (as determined by Company after consultation with its outside
counsel) that is no less restrictive in any material respect than the
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Company Superior Proposal or Probable Company Superior
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY TAKEOVER PROPOSAL" means
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any person relating to any (w) direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or
more of the net revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (x) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or
of 50% or more of any class of equity securities of any of its Subsidiaries
whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income   
40   or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y)
tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of
Company or 50% of any class of equity securities of any of its Subsidiaries
whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (z) merger,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall immediately terminate, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, or
other representatives to immediately terminate, all discussions or
negotiations, if any, with any third party with respect to a Company Takeover
Proposal.   (b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.3 and
Section 7.5(a), neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal, (iii) permit the Company to waive
or otherwise fail to enforce any standstill agreement or similar arrangement
between the Company and any other person, or (iv) cause the Company to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement (each, a "COMPANY ACQUISITION AGREEMENT") related to
any Company Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that in light of a Company Superior
Proposal it is necessary to do so in order to act in a manner consistent with
its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable law, the
Board of Directors of the Company may (subject to this and the following
sentences) terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into such
Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this Section 7.3(b) unless and until (i) three business days have elapsed
following the delivery to Parent of a written notice of such determination by
the Board of Directors of Company and (x) the Company has delivered to Parent
the written notice required by Section 7.3(c) below and (y) during such three
business day period, the Company otherwise cooperates with Parent with
respect to the Company Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal with the intent of enabling Parent to engage in good
faith negotiations to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of
the Merger as would enable the Company to proceed with the Merger on such
adjusted terms, (ii) at the end of such three business day period the Board
of Directors of the Company continues reasonably to believe that the Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (iii) the
Company pays the Company Termination Fee as provided in Section 9.5. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "COMPANY SUPERIOR PROPOSAL" means a bona fide
written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly,
including pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, more
than 30% of the combined voting power of the shares of the Company Common
Stock then outstanding or more than 40% of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of Company
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial
advisor of    41   nationally recognized reputation) to be more
favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than the Merger (after considering
(1) any adjustment to the terms and conditions of the Merger proposed by
Parent in response to a Company Takeover Proposal and (2) the Company
Termination Fee) and (i) for which financing, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being
obtained by such third party and (ii) which, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Company, is reasonably likely of being
completed.   (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth
in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 7.3, the Company shall immediately
advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information or of any
Company Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request
or Company Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making such
request or Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed of the status and details (including amendments and
proposed amendments) of any such request or Company Takeover Proposal.  
(d) Nothing contained in this Section 7.3 prohibits the Company from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to
the Company\'s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so
to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable law;
provided, however, that, except as expressly permitted by paragraph (b) of
this Section 7.3 in connection with a Company Superior Proposal, neither the
Company nor its Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw
or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions contemplated
hereby, or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend,
a Company Takeover Proposal.   Section 7.4. Registration Statement. As
promptly as practicable, Parent and the Company shall in consultation with
each other prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and
Parent, in consultation with the Company, shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Registration Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective
as soon as practicable. Parent shall also use its reasonable best efforts to
take any action required to be taken under state securities or blue sky laws
in connection with the issuance of the shares of Parent Common Stock and
Parent Preferred Stock pursuant to this Agreement in the Merger. The Company
shall furnish Parent with all information concerning the Company and the
holders of its capital stock and shall take such other action as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the Registration Statement and the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any event or circumstance relating to
Parent, any Subsidiary of Parent, the Company, or their respective officers
or directors, should be discovered by such party which should be set forth in
an amendment or a supplement to the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement-Prospectus, such party shall promptly inform the other thereof and
take appropriate action in respect thereof.    42    Section 7.5. Proxy
Statement-Prospectus; Stockholder Approvals.   (a) The Company, acting
through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to and in accordance with
applicable law and its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, promptly and
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable following
the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective, a meeting
of the holders of Company Common Stock for the purpose of voting to approve
and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and,
subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company
under applicable law based on advice by outside legal counsel, (i) recommend
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby by the stockholders of the Company and include in the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus such recommendation (the "COMPANY RECOMMENDATION") and (ii) take
all reasonable and lawful action to solicit and obtain such approval. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to it rights pursuant
to Section 7.3(b) and Section 9.1(d), Company agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this Section 7.5(a) will not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of, a
Company Takeover Proposal.   (b) Parent, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall, subject to and in accordance with applicable law and its
Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, promptly and duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold as soon as practicable following the date upon which the
Registration Statement becomes effective, a meeting of the holders of Parent
Common Stock for the purpose of voting to approve the issuance of the shares
of Parent Common Stock and Parent Preferred Stock to be issued in the Merger,
and, subject to the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of Parent
under applicable law based on advice by outside counsel, (i) recommend
approval of such issuance by the stockholders of Parent and include in the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus such recommendation (the "PARENT RECOMMENDATION")
and (ii) take all reasonable and lawful action to solicit and obtain such
approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, but subject to
its rights pursuant to Section 7.2(b) and Section 9.1(g), Parent agrees that
its obligation pursuant to this Section 7.5(b) will not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent,
of a Parent Takeover Proposal.   (c) Parent and the Company, as promptly as
practicable (or with such other timing as Parent and the Company mutually
agree), shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to
the Company\'s stockholders.   (d) At or prior to the Closing, each of
Parent and the Company shall deliver to the other a certificate of its
Secretary setting forth the voting results from its stockholder meeting.  
(e) Parent and Company shall use all reasonable best efforts to hold their
respective stockholders meetings on the same date and as soon as practicable
after the date hereof.    43    Section 7.6. Compliance with the
Securities Act.   (a) At least 30 days prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent a list identifying all persons
who were, in its reasonable judgment, at the record date for the Company\'s
stockholders\' meeting convened in accordance with Section 7.5(a) hereof,
"affiliates" of the Company as that term is used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "AFFILIATES").   (b) The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each person who is identified
as one of its Affiliates in its list referred to in Section 7.6(a) above to
deliver to Parent (with a copy to the Company), at or prior to the Effective
Time, a written agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
"AFFILIATE LETTERS").   (c) If any Affiliate of the Company refuses to
provide an Affiliate Letter, Parent may place appropriate legends on the
certificates evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by
such Affiliate pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for shares of
Parent Common Stock to the effect that the shares of Parent Common Stock
received by such Affiliate pursuant to this Agreement only may be sold,
transferred or otherwise conveyed (i) pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in compliance with Rule 145
promulgated under the Securities Act or (iii) pursuant to another exemption
under the Securities Act.   Section 7.7. Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to
the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the parties hereto agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the obtaining of all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and the
effecting of all necessary registrations and filings. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, as promptly as practicable, the Company, Parent
and Sub shall make all filings and submissions under the HSR Act and with
respect to the Other Governmental Approvals as may be reasonably required to
be made in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company will furnish to
Parent and Sub, and Parent and Sub will furnish to the Company, such
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection
with the preparation of any such filings or submissions. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company will provide Parent and Sub,
and Parent and Sub will provide the Company, with copies of all material
written correspondence, filings and communications (or memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between such party or any of its representatives
and any Governmental Entity, with respect to the obtaining of any waivers,
consents or approvals and the making of any registrations or filings, in each
case that is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement,
the proper officers or directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall take all such necessary action. Each of the parties will use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the tax opinion to be delivered by its
counsel pursuant to    44   Section 8.2(d) or Section 8.3(c), as the
case may be, be delivered and not withdrawn or modified in any material
respect.   Section 7.8. Company Stock Options. At the Effective Time, except
as provided in the next sentence, each of the Company Stock Options that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be assumed by
Parent and converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of
Parent Common Stock (a "NEW OPTION") in an amount and at an exercise price
determined as provided below. The Company shall make the cash payments
required under each limited right granted with respect to any Company Stock
Option that is "in-the-money" at the Effective Time based upon the Exchange
Ratio, which payment shall cause the cancellation of such Company Stock
Option, pursuant to the terms of the agreement and Company Plan governing
such Company Stock Option and shall use its reasonable best efforts (which
efforts shall not require the Company to obtain stockholder approval) to make
any agreements and modifications necessary to cash out (which shall cause the
cancellation of such Company Stock Option) any Company Stock Option that is
"in-the-money" at the Effective Time based upon the Exchange Ratio and does
not have an associated limited stock appreciation right.   (a) The number
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject to the New Option shall be
equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
remaining subject (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) to the
original option and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded
down to the nearest share; and   (b) The exercise price per share of Parent
Common Stock under the New Option shall be equal to the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock under the original option divided by the
Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded up to the
nearest cent.   The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options
which are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code)
shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent with
Section 424(a) of the Code. After the Effective Time, each New Option shall
be exercisable and shall vest upon the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the related Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that all references to the Company shall be deemed to
be references to Parent. The Company shall take all actions necessary
(including adopting amendments, if necessary, to the Company Plans, but none
of which would require the Company to obtain stockholder approval) to effect
the assumption and conversion of Company Stock Options described in this
Section 7.8. Promptly after the Effective Time, but no later than ten
business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or other appropriate form) or a post-
effective amendment to the Registration Statement for purposes of registering
all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable after the Effective Time upon
exercise of the New Options, and use all reasonable efforts to (i) have such
registration statement or post-effective amendment become effective
with respect thereto as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and
(ii) maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for
so long as the New Options remain    45   outstanding or for so long as
such registration statement is required with respect to any Company Plan.  
Section 7.9. Public Announcements. Each of Parent, Sub, and the
Company agrees that it will not issue any press release or otherwise make any
public statement with respect to this Agreement (including the Exhibits
hereto) or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior
consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; provided, however, that such disclosure can be made without
obtaining such prior consent if (i) the disclosure is required by law or by
obligations imposed pursuant to any listing agreement with the NNM, the New
York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange and (ii) the
party making such disclosure has first used its reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party about the form and substance of such
disclosure.   Section 7.10. Directors\' and Officers\' Indemnification.  
(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Corporation
shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law, indemnify,
defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time,
an officer, director or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
against (i) all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses), claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the
next succeeding sentence, amounts paid in settlement, arising out of actions
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) that are, in
whole or in part, based on or arising out of the fact that such person is or
was a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or served as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) at any time maintained by or
contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries ("INDEMNIFIED
LIABILITIES"), and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are
based on or arise out of or pertain to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limitation to clauses (i) and (ii), Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent not prohibited by
applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and provide advancement
of expenses to, all past and present officers, directors and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) to the same extent
such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as
of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company\'s
certificate of incorporation, bylaws and indemnification agreements, if any,
in existence on the date hereof (each of which indemnification agreements is
listed on Schedule 7.10(a)). In the event of any such Indemnified Liability,
(i) Parent and Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor are
received and otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request
reimbursement of documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) Parent shall
cooperate in the defense of such matter and (iii) any determination required
to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party\'s conduct complies
with the standards set forth under applicable law and the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws shall be made by independent counsel
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party; provided,   
46   however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable
for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event that any Indemnified
Party is required to bring any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys
due under this Agreement and is successful in such action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall reimburse such Indemnified Party for all of its
expenses in bringing and pursuing such action including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys\' fees and costs. In addition, from and after the
Effective Time, directors and officers of the Company who become directors or
officers of Parent will be entitled to indemnification under Parent\'s
certificate of incorporation and by-laws, as the case may be, as the same may
be amended from time to time in accordance with their terms and applicable
law.   (b) In the event that Parent or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.10(b).   (c) For six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance covering acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
with respect to those persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy on terms with respect
to such coverage and amount no less favorable than those of the policy of the
Company in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that in no event
will Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this
Section 7.10(c) in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premiums paid or
payable by the Company for such purpose with respect to coverage for the
policy year ending February 2004; provided, further, that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent will be
obligated to obtain a policy with the best coverage available, in
the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of Parent, for a cost up to
but not exceeding such amount. In addition, for six years after the Effective
Time, Parent shall maintain in effect fiduciary liability insurance policies
for employees who serve or have served as fiduciaries under or with respect
to any employee benefit plans described in Section 7.10(a) with coverages and
in amounts no less favorable than those of the policies of the Company in
effect on the date hereof.   (d) The provisions of this Section 7.10(d) (i)
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or
otherwise.   Section 7.11. Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in
Section 9.5, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses.   Section 7.12.
Listing Application. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Agreement in
the Merger to be    47   approved for listing on the NNM, subject to
official notice of issuance, and to be reserved for issuance upon conversion
of the Parent Preferred Stock and upon the exercise of New Options, prior to
the Effective Time.   Section 7.13. Supplemental Disclosure. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event the
occurrence, or non-occurrence, of which would be likely to cause (x) any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate or (y) any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this
Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied and (ii) any failure of the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 7.13 shall not have any effect for the purpose of determining
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VIII of this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
any party.   Section 7.14. Letters of Accountants.   (a) Parent shall use
all reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter of
Ernst and Young LLP, Parent\'s independent auditors, dated a date within two
business days before the date on which the Registration Statement shall
become effective and addressed to the Company, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and substance
for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement, which
letter shall be brought down to the Effective Time.   (b) The Company shall
use all reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter
of Deloitte and Touche LLP, the Company\'s independent auditors, dated a date
within two business days before the date on which the Registration Statement
shall become effective and addressed to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for
letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Registration Statement, which
letter shall be brought down to the Effective Time.   Section 7.15.
Consulting and Other Agreements. Between the date hereof and the Closing
Date, Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to enter into employment, consulting or similar arrangements with the
individuals set forth on Schedule 7.15 hereto and establish the
other arrangements described on Schedule 7.15 hereto, which agreements
and arrangements shall include the substantive terms set forth on Schedule
7.15 hereto.   Section 7.16. Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to all employees of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time who remain employees of the
Surviving Corporation compensation and benefits which are, in the aggregate,
substantially    48   comparable to the compensation and benefits
provided to such employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time, or in the alternative, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, include such employees of the Company in the compensation and
benefit programs of Parent applicable to similarly situated employees of
Parent. At all times following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to cause, each of the employee benefit
plans and programs covering individuals who were employees of the Company
before the Effective Time to recognize service performed as an employee of
the Company prior to the Effective Time, but such recognition of service will
not be required to result in any duplication of benefits.   (b) Within the
time period permitted under ERISA Section 4043, Parent shall file with the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation any notice that is required under ERISA
Section 4043 with respect to each Parent Plan, and the Company shall file
with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation any notice that is required
under ERISA Section 4043 with respect to each Company Plan.   Section 7.17.
Stockholder Litigation. Each of Parent and the Company shall give the other

similar limitation set forth therein), as of the date hereof, and, except to
the extent such representations and warranties speak as of an earlier

respects all obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement
at or prior to the Effective Time.   (c) Tax Opinion of Counsel. Parent

opinion, Gardner Carton may require and rely upon representations contained
in certificates of officers of Parent, Sub and the Company, certain

not have been withdrawn or modified in any material respect; provided,

certificate and representation shall be in form and substance satisfactory to
Gardner Carton.   (d) No Company Material Adverse Effect. No Company
Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred since the date of this Agreement

"material adverse effect" or any similar limitation set forth therein) as of
the date hereof, and, except to the extent such representations and
warranties speak as of an earlier date, as of the Effective Time as though
made on and as of the Effective Time, except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct could not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Performance of Obligations of Parent and Sub. Each
of Parent and Sub shall have performed in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior
to the Effective Time.   (c) Tax Opinion of Counsel. The Company shall have

the Company or any of the holders of Company Common Stock or Company

substance satisfactory to Jones Day.   (d) No Parent Material Adverse

Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or
waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on

any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise will not constitute a
waiver of such rights.   Section 9.5. Fees and Expenses.   (a) Except as

with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are
to be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the

Rights.   (a) In the event of any liquidation, winding-up or dissolution
of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, each Holder shall,
subject to the prior rights of any holders of Senior Stock, be entitled to
receive and to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders the Liquidation Preference for each
outstanding share of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder, in
preference to the holders of, and before any payment or distribution is made
on (or any setting apart for any payment or distribution), any Junior Stock,
including, without limitation, on any Common Stock. After the payment to the
Holders of the Liquidation Preference for each outstanding share of the

share of the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock and shall not be
entitled to any further participation in distributions of, and shall have no

of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock.   (b) Upon any liquidation,

conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares of stock, other securities
or other consideration) of all or substantially all the assets or business of
the Corporation (other than in connection with the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, winding-up or dissolution of the Corporation) nor the merger or
consolidation of the Corporation into or with any other Person shall be
deemed to be a liquidation, winding-up or dissolution, voluntary or

which such Holders    6  are entitled pursuant to Section 3(a), no such
distribution shall be made on account of any shares of Liquidation Parity
Stock upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution unless proportionate
distributable amounts shall be paid with equal priority on account of the
Series A Preferred Stock, ratably, in proportion to the full distributable
amounts for which Holders and holders of any Liquidation Parity Stock are
entitled upon such liquidation, winding-up or dissolution.   4. Voting;
Amendments.   (a) The shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have no
voting rights except as set forth in Section 4(b) and 4(c) or as otherwise
required by Delaware law from time to time. In exercising the voting rights
set forth in Section 4(b) and 4(c), each Holder shall be entitled to one vote
for each share of the Series A Preferred Stock held by such Holder.   (b)
So long as any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding,
unless a greater percentage shall then be required by law, the Corporation
shall not, without the affirmative vote or written consent of the Holders
(voting or consenting separately as one class) of at least 66 2/3% of the
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, authorize, increase
the authorized amount of, reclassify any authorized capital stock or the
Corporation into, or issue, any shares of any class or series of Senior Stock
(or any security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Senior
Stock), or adopt amendments to the Certificate of Incorporation or the by-
laws of the Corporation, that would materially affect the existing terms of
the Series A Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
otherwise required by law, the Corporation may, without the consent of any
Holder, authorize, increase the authorized amount of, or issue shares of
Parity Stock or Junior Stock, and in taking such actions the Corporation
shall not be deemed to have materially adversely affected the existing terms
of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the Corporation may, without
the consent of any Holder, enter into a Transaction, as described in Section
9(i), in which the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock become
convertible into securities other than the Common Stock, cash or other
property, or consolidate with or merge into any other Person or convey,
transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets to any Person or permit
any Person to consolidate with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or
substantially all its properties to, the Corporation, as described in Section
12.   (c) So long as at least 100,000 shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock remain outstanding:   (i) If, for each of six consecutive
Dividend Periods, the  Corporation fails to pay in cash, shares of Common
Stock or  a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, the full 
dividend amount payable to the Holders with respect to such  dividend Period
pursuant to Sections 6(a) and 6(b), then  the Holders, voting separately as
one class, will be  entitled at the next regular or special meeting of 
stockholders of the Corporation to elect one additional  director of the
Corporation. Effective immediately prior  to the election of such additional
director, the number of  directors that compose the Board of Directors shall
be  increased by one director.    7   (ii) The Holders may exercise the
voting rights set forth in  Section 4(c) (i) at any special meeting of the
Holders held  for such purpose, which may be called in accordance with the 
Corporation\'s by-laws or as hereinafter provided, or at any  annual meeting
of stockholders held for the purpose of  electing directors, and thereafter
at each such annual meeting  until such time as fewer than 100,000 shares of
the Series A  Preferred Stock are outstanding, such time as the outstanding 
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been mandatorily  converted or
redeemed, or the liquidation, winding-up or  dissolution of the Corporation,
whichever is earliest, at  which time such voting rights and the term of any
director  elected pursuant to this Section 4(c) shall automatically 
terminate.   (iii) At any time when the voting rights set forth in Section 
4(c)(i) shall have vested in the Holders, an Officer of the  Corporation may
call, and, upon written request of the Holders  of at least twenty-five
percent (25%) of the outstanding  shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
addressed to the  Secretary of the Corporation, shall call a special meeting
of  the Holders. Such meeting shall be held at the earliest  practicable
date upon the notice required for annual meetings  of stockholders at the
place for holding annual meetings of  stockholders of the Corporation, or, if
none, at a place  designated by the Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the 
provisions of this Section 4(c)(iii), no such special meeting  shall be
called during a period within the 60 days immediately  preceding the date
fixed for the next annual meeting of  stockholders in which such case, the
election of directors  pursuant to Section 4(c) shall be held at such annual
meeting  of stockholders.   (iv) At any meeting held for the purpose of
electing directors at  which the Holders voting separately as one class shall
have  the right to elect a director as provided in this Section  4(c), the
presence in person or by proxy of the Holders of  more than fifty percent
(50%) of the then outstanding shares  of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
be required and shall be  sufficient to constitute a quorum of such class for
the  election of a director by such class. The director candidate  that
receives the highest number of affirmative votes of the  outstanding shares
of the Series A Preferred Stock will be  elected.   (v) Any director
elected pursuant to the voting rights set  forth in this Section 4(c) shall
hold office until the next  annual meeting of stockholders (or his or her
earlier  death, resignation or removal), unless such term has  previously
automatically terminated pursuant to Section  4(c)(ii)) and any vacancy in
respect of any such director  shall be filled only by the Holders at a
special meeting  called in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
Section 4(c), or, if no such special meeting is called, at  the next annual
meeting of stockholders. The Holders shall  be entitled to remove any
director elected pursuant to this  Section 4(c) without cause at any time and
replace such  director as provided in this Section 4(c).    8   5.
Dividends; Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases.   (a) Subject to the rights
of any holders of Senior Stock or Parity Stock, each Holder will be entitled
to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of assets
of the Company legally available therefor, dividends on each share of the
Series A Preferred Stock at a rate per annum equal to 7.75% of the
Liquidation Preference, or $3.875 per share annually (or $0.96875 per share
in a full quarterly dividend period), payable quarterly in arrears on each
Dividend Payment Date, to the Holders at the close of business on the Record
Date immediately preceding the relevant Dividend Payment Date.   (b)
Dividends on the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will be
payable from the most recent Dividend Payment Date or, in the case of the
dividend payable on _______ 15, 2003, from the Issue Date (each such period,
a "Dividend Period"). Dividends payable on the Series A Preferred Stock with
respect to any period other than a full Dividend Period shall be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If a
Dividend Payment Date is not a Business Day, payment of dividends shall be
made on the next succeeding Business Day.   (c) In the event that the Board
of Directors declares a dividend with respect to a Dividend Period in an
amount less than the full amount payable to the Holders with respect to such
Dividend Period pursuant to Sections 5(a) and 5(b) (such lesser amount, a
"Partial Dividend"), such Partial Dividend shall be distributed to the
Holders on a pro rata basis with respect to the outstanding shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock.   (d) Any dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be, at the option of the Corporation, payable in cash, in shares of
Common Stock or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The
Corporation may not elect to pay any portion of the dividend with respect to
any Dividend Period in shares of Common Stock unless the covenants set forth
in Sections 15(f), 15(g), 15(h) and 15(i) shall have been satisfied with
respect to all of the shares of Common Stock to be issued in payment thereof
("Dividend Common Stock"). If the Corporation elects to pay any portion of a
dividend in Common Stock:   (i) The Corporation shall furnish written notice
of such  election by issuing a press release for publication on the  PR
Newswire or an equivalent newswire service, if required  by and in accordance
with the federal securities laws or  the rules of any stock exchange on which
the Series A  Preferred Stock or the Common Stock is then listed or  traded,
and in any case by first class mail to each Holder  or by publication (with
subsequent prompt notice by first  class mail to each Holder), at least ten
days in advance of  the Record Date for the relevant Dividend Payment
Date.   (ii) The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued as a 
dividend on the applicable Dividend Payment Date per share of  the Series A
Preferred Stock will be determined by dividing  (w) the difference between
the total declared dividend amount  per share of the Series A Preferred Stock
to be paid with  respect to the applicable Dividend Period and the amount
of  the cash dividend, if any, to be paid per share of the Series  A
Preferred Stock    9   with respect to such Dividend Period, by (x) the
applicable  Discounted Current Market Value of the Common Stock. The 
"Discounted Current Market Value" of a share of the Common  Stock with
respect to a Dividend Payment Date shall equal the  product of (y) 95% and
(z) the average closing price of a  share of the Common Stock on the NNM (or
such other national  securities exchange or automated quotation system on
which the  Common Stock is then listed or authorized for quotation or, if 
the Common Stock is not so listed or authorized for quotation,  an amount
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors  to be the fair value of
the Common Stock) for the ten  consecutive Trading Day period ending on and
including the  fifth Trading Day before such Dividend Payment Date.   (iii)
No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued in  payment of any
dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock. The  Transfer Agent is hereby
authorized to aggregate any  fractional shares of Common Stock that would
otherwise be  distributable as Dividend Common Stock, to sell them at the 
best available price and to distribute the proceeds to the  Holders in
proportion to their respective interests. The  Corporation shall reimburse
the Transfer Agent for any  expenses incurred with respect to such sale,
including  brokerage commissions. If the sale by the Transfer Agent of  such
aggregated fractional shares of Common Stock would be  restricted, the
Corporation shall agree with the Transfer  Agent on other appropriate
arrangements for the cash  realization of such fractional shares of Common
Stock. If the  Corporation is precluded from paying cash in lieu of 
fractional shares to the Holders on the Dividend Payment Date,  such failure
shall not trigger an automatic increase in the  Conversion Ratio pursuant to
Section 5(g)(ii), and the  Corporation shall, when it becomes legally and
contractually  able to, pay to the Holders such cash in lieu of fractional 
shares.   (e) The Corporation will not declare, pay or set apart any sum
for the payment of any dividend or other distribution in respect of any
Parity Stock or Junior Stock, unless the Board of Directors has declared, and
the Corporation has not failed to pay, a dividend in the full amount payable
to the Holders pursuant to Sections 5(a) and 5(b) with respect to the
Dividend Period in which such payment of a dividend or other distribution in
respect of any Parity Stock or Junior Stock would occur. Notwithstanding
anything in this Certificate of Incorporation to the contrary, the
Corporation may:   (i) declare and pay dividends on Parity Stock which are
payable  solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock;   (ii) declare
and pay dividends on Junior Stock which are payable  solely in shares of
Junior Stock;   (iii) declare and pay dividends on Parity Stock or Junior
Stock by  increasing the liquidation value of the Parity Stock or Junior 
Stock, as applicable;    10   (iv) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire Junior Stock in  exchange for Junior Stock; or   (v) repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire Parity Stock in  exchange for Parity Stock or
Junior Stock.   (f) If the Board of Directors declares a dividend with
respect to a Dividend Period, the Holders at the close of business on the
applicable Record Date will be entitled to receive the dividend payment on
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock on the corresponding Dividend Payment
Date notwithstanding the conversion thereof subsequent to such Record Date,
unless the Corporation defaults in payment of such dividend on the
corresponding Dividend Payment Date, in which case such Holders shall be
issued on the Dividend Payment Date, in addition to the shares of Common
Stock issued on the conversion date, an additional number of shares of Common
Stock per converted share of the Series A Preferred Stock equal to the
automatic increase in the Conversion Ratio pursuant to Section 5(g)(ii).
However, shares of the Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion
during the period between the close of business on any Record Date and the
close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable
Dividend Payment Date must be accompanied by payment of an amount in cash
equal to the cash dividend amount payable on that Dividend Payment Date (or,
if the dividend payable on that Dividend Payment Date is payable in
Common Stock in whole or in part, an amount in cash equal to the cash
dividend amount that would have been payable on that Dividend Payment Date if
the Corporation had elected to pay such dividend solely in cash) on the
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion. A Holder
on a Record Date who (or whose transferee) tenders any shares for conversion
on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date will receive any dividend payable
by the Corporation on such tendered shares of the Series A Preferred Stock on
that date, and the converting Holder need not include payment in the amount
of such dividend upon surrender of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock for
conversion.   (g) The difference between (x) the full amount payable per
share of the Series A Preferred Stock to the Holders with respect to any
Dividend Period pursuant to Sections 5(a) and 5(b) and (y) any lesser (or
zero) actual dividend amount paid per share of the Series A Preferred Stock
with respect to such Dividend Period, resulting from the failure of the Board
of Directors to declare any dividend with respect to such Dividend Period,
the declaration by the Board of Directors of a Partial Dividend with respect
to such Dividend Period, or the failure of the Corporation to pay on the
applicable Dividend Payment Date the dividend or Partial Dividend declared by
the Board of Directors for such Dividend Period, is referred to as the
"Dividend Deficiency." In the event that a Dividend Deficiency shall occur
with respect to any Dividend Period:   (i) The Holders will not be entitled
to receive the amount of the  Dividend Deficiency with respect to such
Dividend Period, and  the amount of the Dividend Deficiency with respect to
such  Dividend Period shall not accumulate and no interest or sum of  money
or other property or securities in lieu of interest will  be payable in
respect of such Dividend Deficiency.    11   (ii) The Conversion Ratio
shall automatically increase on the  Dividend Payment Date on which the
amount of such Dividend  Deficiency would have been paid by a number of
shares of  Common Stock equal to 115% of the number of shares of Common 
Stock that the Corporation would have been required to issue  as a stock
dividend on each share of the Series A Preferred  Stock to pay the Dividend
Deficiency with respect to the  applicable Dividend Period in full. Such
automatic increase in  the Conversion Ratio shall be deemed to fully satisfy
in all  respects the payment of the amount of the Dividend Deficiency  with
respect to the applicable Dividend Period, and, except  for the voting rights
described in Section 4(c), no other  rights or interest will accrue to the
Holders as a result of  any Dividend Deficiency, whether or not the earnings
or net  surplus of the Corporation in any calendar or fiscal year of  the
Corporation were sufficient to pay any such Dividend  Deficiency in whole or
in part.   (iii) Upon any automatic increase in the Conversion Ratio
pursuant  to Section 5(g)(ii), the Corporation promptly shall deliver to 
the Transfer Agent an Officers\' Certificate describing in  reasonable detail
the Dividend Deficiency requiring the  automatic increase in the Conversion
Ratio and the method of  calculation thereof in accordance with the
provisions of this  Certificate of Incorporation and specifying the
increased  Conversion Ratio in effect following such automatic increase.  
(iv) The Corporation shall furnish notice of any Dividend  Deficiency and
resulting automatic increase in the Conversion  Ratio pursuant to Section
5(g)(ii) by issuing a press release  for publication on the PR Newswire or an
equivalent newswire  service, if required by and in accordance with the
federal  securities laws or the rules of any stock exchange on which  the
Series A Preferred Stock or the Common Stock is then  listed or traded, and
in any case by distribution of a copy of  the Officers\' Certificate
described in Section 5(g)(iii) to  each Holder by first class mail or by
publication (with  subsequent prompt distribution of such notice by first
class  mail to each Holder) , (A) at least ten days in advance of the 
Record Date for the relevant Dividend Payment Date, in the  event that the
Board of Directors does not declare a dividend  with respect to any Dividend
Period or declares a Partial  Dividend with respect to any Dividend Period,
or (B) no more  than three days after the relevant Dividend Payment Date,
if  the Corporation fails to pay a dividend or Partial Dividend  declared by
the Board of Directors with respect to any  Dividend Period.    (h)
Automatic increases in the Conversion Ratio pursuant to Section 5(g)(ii) will
occur each time a Dividend Deficiency occurs with respect to a Dividend
Period, and such increases in the Conversion Ratio shall accumulate with
respect to each outstanding share of the Series A Preferred Stock, until the
earlier of (i) such time as such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
are redeemed for cash or converted into Common Stock, cash or other property
as provided in this Certificate of Incorporation, or (ii) such time
as distributions of the Corporation\'s assets with respect to such shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock are made upon the liquidation, winding-up
of dissolution of the Corporation as provided in this Certificate of
Incorporation. Upon distribution of the Corporation\'s assets to the Holders
with respect to the outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock upon
the liquidation,    12  winding-up of dissolution of the Corporation as
provided in Section 3 or upon the mandatory redemption of the outstanding
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 10, the
Corporation shall not pay to any Holder any amount per share of the Series A
Preferred Stock in excess of the Liquidation Preference to compensate such
Holder for Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases through the date
of liquidation or the Mandatory Redemption Date.   (i) The Corporation shall
take all actions required or permitted under the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware to permit the payment of dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock and automatic increases in the Conversion Ratio pursuant to
Section 5(g)(ii).   (j) In the event that the Corporation consummates a
transaction described in Section 1(d)(ii) , and the laws of the jurisdiction
in which the successor, transferee or lessee is organized would impose a
withholding tax on any dividend payment hereunder, the Corporation shall:  
(i) furnish written notice to the Holders, by issuing a press  release for
publication on the PR Newswire or an equivalent  newswire service, if
required by and in accordance with the  federal securities laws or the rules
of any stock exchange  on which the Series A Preferred Stock or the Common
Stock  is then listed or traded, and in any case by distribution  of such
notice to each Holder by first class mail or by  publication (with subsequent
prompt distribution of such  notice by first class mail to each Holder) at
least ten  days in advance of the Record Date for the first Dividend 
Payment Date on which any dividend payable hereunder would  be subject to
such withholding tax, whether or not any  dividend is paid on such Dividend
Payment Date, which  notice shall state that withholding taxes may be
imposed  with respect to dividends payable on the Series A Preferred  Stock
and that the Corporation will, as described in  Section 5(j)(ii) below,
increase the dividend amounts  payable on the Series A Preferred Stock with
respect to all  Dividend Periods for which such withholding taxes apply;  
(ii) with respect to the dividend payable on each Dividend Payment  Date for
which any such withholding tax may be imposed,  increase the dividend amount
payable to the Holders such that  the net dividend amount payable to the
Holders on such  Dividend Payment Date after giving effect to any such 
withholding tax shall be equivalent to the dividend that the  Holders would
have received on such Dividend Payment Date  absent such withholding tax;
and   (iii) with respect to each dividend for which any such withholding 
tax may be imposed, deliver to the Transfer Agent promptly  after the
declaration of such dividend an Officers\'  Certificate describing in detail
the dividend    13   amount that would have been payable on the relevant
Dividend  Payment Date before the increase for withholding taxes  pursuant
to Section 5(j)(ii) and the amount by which such  dividend amount was
increased to produce a net dividend amount  equal to the dividend amount that
the Holders would have  received on the relevant Dividend Payment Date absent
such  withholding tax.   6. Voluntary Conversion.   (a) Each Holder shall
have the right, at its option, exercisable at any time and from time to time
from the Issue Date, to convert, subject to the terms and provisions of this
Section 6 and Section 10, any or all of such Holder\'s shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock into such whole number of shares of Common Stock per share of
the Series A Preferred Stock as is equal to the Conversion Ratio in effect on
the date of conversion, plus cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common
Stock as provided in Section 7.   (b) The conversion right of a Holder shall
be exercised by the Holder by the delivery to the Corporation at any time
during usual business hours at the Corporation\'s principal place of business
or the offices of the Transfer Agent of a written notice to the Corporation
in the form of Exhibit B that the Holder elects to convert the number of its
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock specified in such notice. The
conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock not represented by
physical certificates will be effected through the facilities of the
Depositary as described in Section 14. If the shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock that the Holder wishes to convert are represented by one or
more physical certificates, the Holder shall be required to surrender such
physical certificate or certificates to the Corporation or the Transfer Agent
(properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so
require). The shares of Common Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional share
due to such Holder surrendering physical certificates shall be delivered to
the Holder and each surrendered physical certificate shall be canceled
and retired. Immediately prior to the close of business on the date of
receipt by the Corporation or its duly appointed Transfer Agent of notice of
conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, each converting Holder
shall be deemed to be the holder of record of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of such Holder\'s shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
notwithstanding that the share register of the Corporation shall then be
closed or that, if applicable, physical certificates representing such Common
Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such Holder. On the date of any
conversion, all rights of any Holder with respect to the shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock so converted, including the rights, if any, to receive
distributions of the Corporation\'s assets (including, but not limited to,
the Liquidation Preference) or notices from the Corporation, will terminate,
except only for the rights of any such Holder to (i) receive physical
certificates (if applicable) for the number of whole shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been converted
and cash in lieu of any fractional share as provided in Section 7, and (ii)
exercise the rights to which he, she or it is entitled as a holder of Common
Stock into which such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have been
converted.   7. No Fractional Shares Upon Conversion. No fractional shares
or securities representing fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued
upon any conversion of any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, whether
voluntary or mandatory. If more than one share    14  of the Series A
Preferred Stock held by the same Holder shall be subject to conversion at one
time, the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
Liquidation Preference of, and any applicable Accumulated Automatic
Conversion Ratio Increases with respect to, all of such shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock as of the conversion date. If the conversion of any share
or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock results in a fraction, an amount
equal to such fraction multiplied by the last reported sale price of the
Common Stock on the NNM (or such other national securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which the Common Stock is then listed or
authorized for quotation or, if the Common Stock is not so listed or
authorized for quotation, an amount determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors to be the fair value of the Common Stock) at the close of business
on the Trading Day next preceding the conversion date shall be paid to such
Holder in cash by the Corporation.   8. Adjustments to Conversion Price. Any
adjustment to the Conversion Price shall result in a change in the Conversion
Ratio. The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:  
(a) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time:   (i)
pay a dividend (or other distribution) payable in shares of  Common Stock on
any class of capital stock (which, for  purposes of this Section 8 shall
include, without  limitation, any dividends or distributions in the form of 
options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital stock)  of the
Corporation (other than the issuance of shares of  Common Stock in connection
with the conversion of the  Series A Preferred Stock or as dividends in
respect of the  Series A Preferred Stock or any Parity Stock);   (ii)
subdivide the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a  larger number of
shares;   (iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a 
smaller number of shares;   (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock in a
reclassification  of the Common Stock; or   (v) pay a dividend or make a
distribution to all holders of  shares of Common Stock (other than a dividend
subject to  Section 8(b)) pursuant to a stockholder rights plan,  "poison
pill" or similar arrangement, then, and in each  such case, the Conversion
Price in effect immediately prior  to such event shall be adjusted (and any
other appropriate  actions shall be taken by the Corporation) so that the 
Holder of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock thereafter  surrendered for
conversion shall be entitled to receive the  number of shares of Common Stock
that such Holder would  have owned or would have been entitled to receive
upon or  by reason of any of the events described above, had such  share of
the Series A Preferred Stock been converted into  shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to the occurrence  of such event. An adjustment made
pursuant to this Section    15   8(a) shall become effective
retroactively (x) in the case  of any such dividend or distribution, to the
day  immediately following the close of business on the record  date for the
determination of holders of Common Stock  entitled to receive such dividend
or distribution or (y) in  the case of any such subdivision, combination or 
reclassification, to the close of business on the day upon  which such
corporate action becomes effective.   (b) In case the Corporation shall at
any time or from time to time issue to all holders of its Common Stock
rights, options or warrants entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or
purchase shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock) at a price per share less than the
Market Value for the period ending on the date of issuance (treating the
price per share of any security convertible into, or exchangeable or
exercisable for, Common Stock as equal to (i) the sum of the price paid to
acquire such security convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for,
Common Stock plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any
anti-dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such
security into Common Stock divided by (ii) the number of shares of Common
Stock into which such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security is
initially convertible, exchangeable or exercisable), other than (A) issuances
of such rights, options or warrants if the Holder would be entitled
to receive such rights, options or warrants upon conversion at any time of
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock and (B) issuances
that are subject to certain triggering events (until such time as such
triggering events occur), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price
then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect
on the day immediately prior to the record date of such issuance by a
fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of additional
shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued upon or as a result of the
issuance of such rights, options or warrants (or the maximum number into or
for which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may convert
or exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights initially may
be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date plus the number of
shares of Common Stock which the aggregate consideration for the total number
of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued (or into or for which
such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or exchange or for
which such options, warrants or other rights may be exercised plus the
aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon the
conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at the
Market Value for the period ending on the date of conversion; provided,
however, that if the Corporation distributes rights or warrants (other than
those referred to above in this Section 8(b)) pro rata to the holders of
Common Stock, the Conversion Price shall not be subject to adjustment on
account of any declaration, distribution or exercise of such rights or
warrants so long as (x) such rights or warrants have not expired or been
redeemed by the Corporation, and (y) the Holder of any shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to receive
upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock then issuable
upon such conversion (the "Conversion Shares"), a number of rights or
warrants to be determined as follows: (i) if such conversion occurs on or
prior to the date for the distribution to the holders of rights or warrants
of separate certificates evidencing such rights or warrants (the
"Distribution Date"), the same number of rights or warrants to which a holder
of a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Conversion
Shares is entitled at the time of such conversion in accordance with the
terms and    16  provisions applicable to the rights or warrants and (ii)
if such conversion occurs after the Distribution Date, the same number of
rights or warrants to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible
immediately prior to such Distribution Date would have been entitled on such
Distribution Date had such shares of the Series A Preferred Stock been
converted immediately prior to such Distribution Date in accordance with the
terms and provisions applicable to the rights and warrants.   (c) In case
the Corporation shall at any time or from time to time:   (i) make a pro
rata distribution to all holders of shares of  its Common Stock consisting
exclusively of cash (excluding  any cash portion of distributions referred to
in Section  8(a)(v) above, or cash distributed upon a merger or 
consolidation to which Section 8(i) below applies), that,  when combined
together with (x) all other such all-cash  distributions made within the
then-preceding 12 months in  respect of which no adjustment has been made and
(y) any  cash and the fair market value of other consideration paid  or
payable in respect of any tender offer by the  Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries for shares of Common  Stock concluded within the then-preceding
12 months in  respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this Section 8  has
been made, in the aggregate exceeds 10% of the  Corporation\'s market
capitalization (defined as the product  of the Market Value for the period
ending on the record  date of such distribution times the number of shares
of  Common Stock outstanding on such record date) on the record  date of
such distribution;   (ii) complete a tender or exchange offer by the
Corporation or any  of its subsidiaries for shares of Common Stock that
involves  an aggregate consideration that, together with (A) any cash  and
other consideration payable in a tender or exchange offer  by the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries for shares of  Common Stock expiring within the
then-preceding 12 months in  respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this
Section 8 has  been made and (B) the aggregate amount of any such all-cash 
distributions referred to in Section 8(c)(i) to all holders of  shares of
Common Stock within the then-preceding 12 months in  respect of which no
adjustments have been made, exceeds 10% of  the Corporation\'s market
capitalization (as defined in Section  8(c)(ii) on the expiration of such
tender offer; or   (iii) make a distribution to all holders of its Common
Stock  consisting of evidences of indebtedness, shares of its capital  stock
other than Common Stock or assets (including securities,  but excluding those
dividends, rights, options, warrants and  distributions referred to in
Sections 8(a) or 8(b) above or  this Section 8(c), then, and in each such
case, the Conversion  Price then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing
the  Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the date of  such
distribution or completion of such tender or exchange  offer, as the case may
be, by a fraction (x) the    17   numerator of which shall be the Market
Value for the period  ending on the record date for the determination of 
stockholders entitled to receive such distribution, or, if  such adjustment
is made upon the completion of a tender or  exchange offer, on the payment
date for such offer, and (y)  the denominator of which shall be such Market
Value less the  then fair market value (as determined by the Board of 
Directors of the Corporation) of the portion of the cash,  evidences of
indebtedness, securities or other assets so  distributed or paid in such
tender or exchange offer,  applicable to one share of Common Stock (but such
denominator  shall not be less than one); provided, however, that no 
adjustment shall be made with respect to any distribution of  rights to
purchase securities of the Corporation if the Holder  would otherwise be
entitled to receive such rights upon  conversion at any time of shares of the
Series A Preferred  Stock into shares of Common Stock unless such rights
are  subsequently redeemed by the Corporation, in which case such 
redemption shall be treated for purposes of this Section 8(c)  as a dividend
on the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be  made whenever any such
distribution is made or tender or  exchange offer is completed, as the case
may be, and shall  become effective retroactively to a date immediately
following  the close of business on the record date for the determination 
of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.   (d) In the case the
Corporation at any time or from time to time shall take any action affecting
its Common Stock (it being understood that the issuance or sale of shares of
Common Stock (or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
Common Stock, or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of
Common Stock) to any Person at a price per share less than the Conversion
Price then in effect shall not be deemed such an action), other than an
action described in any of Sections 8(a), 8(b), 8(c) or 8(i), then the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as the
Board of Directors of the Corporation in good faith determines to
be equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be evidenced in
a resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the Transfer Agent
and the Holders along with the Officers\' Certificate described in Section
8(h)).   (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
adjustment under this Section 8 need be made to the Conversion Price unless
such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the
Conversion Price then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried
forward and shall be made at the time of and together with the next
subsequent adjustment, if any, which, together with any adjustment or
adjustments so carried forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at
least 1% of such Conversion Price.   (f) The Corporation reserves the right
to make such reductions in the Conversion Price in addition to those required
in the foregoing provisions as it considers advisable in order that any event
treated for federal income tax purposes as a dividend of stock or stock
rights will not be taxable to the recipients. In the event the Corporation
elects to make such a reduction in the Conversion Price, the Corporation will
comply with the requirements of Rule l4e-l under the Exchange Act, and any
other securities laws and regulations thereunder if and to    18  the
extent that such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
the reduction of the Conversion Price.   (g) If the Corporation shall take
a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them
to receive a dividend or other distribution, and shall thereafter (and before
the dividend or distribution has been paid or delivered to stockholders)
legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or distribution,
then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in effect shall be
required by reason of the taking of such record.   (h) Upon any increase or
decrease in the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 8, the Corporation
promptly shall deliver to the Transfer Agent and each Holder an Officers\'
Certificate describing in reasonable detail the event requiring the increase
or decrease in the Conversion Price and the method of calculation thereof and
specifying the increased or decreased Conversion Price and Conversion Ratio
in effect following such adjustment, and attaching and certifying the
resolution of the Board of Directors pursuant to Section 8(d) (if
applicable).   (i) Subject to the provisions of Section 11, in the event of
any reclassification of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a
change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value
to par value), or in the event of any consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with or into another Person or any merger of another Person with
or into the Corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the resulting or surviving Person and which does not result in
any reclassification or change of outstanding Common Stock), or in the event
of any sale or other disposition to another Person of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation (computed on a consolidated basis) (any
of the foregoing, a "Transaction"), each share of the Series A Preferred
Stock then outstanding shall, without the consent of any Holder, become
convertible at any time, at the option of the Holder thereof, only into the
kind and amount of securities (of the Corporation or another issuer), cash
and other property receivable upon such Transaction by a holder of the number
of shares of Common Stock into which such share of the Series A Preferred
Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such Transaction, after
giving effect to any adjustment event, including the exercise of the Change
of Control Option contemplated in Section 11. The provisions of this Section
8(i) and any equivalent thereof in any such securities similarly shall apply
to successive Transactions. The provisions of this Section 8(i) shall be the
sole right of the Holders in connection with any Transaction and such Holders
shall have no separate vote thereon.   (j) For purposes of this Section 8,
the number of shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not
include shares held in treasury of the Corporation. The Corporation shall not
pay any dividend or make any distribution on Common Stock held in treasury of
the Corporation.   9. Mandatory Conversion.   (a) At any time on or after
February 20, 2005, the Corporation shall have the right, at its option, to
cause all, but not a portion, of the outstanding shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that number of whole
shares of Common Stock for each share of the Series A Preferred Stock equal
to the Conversion Ratio then in effect,    19  with any resulting
fractional shares of Common Stock to be settled in accordance with Section 7.
The Corporation may exercise its right to cause a mandatory conversion
pursuant to this Section 9(a) only if the closing price of a share of the
Common Stock as reported on the NYSE (or such other national
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Common Stock
is then listed or authorized for quotation or, if the Common Stock is not so
listed or authorized for quotation, an amount determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors to be the fair value of the Common Stock) equals or
exceeds 125% of the Conversion Price then in effect for at least 20 Trading
Days in any consecutive 30-day trading period, including the last Trading Day
of such 30-day period, ending on the Trading Day prior to the Corporation\'s
issuance of a press release, or, if no press release is issued, mailing of a
notice announcing the mandatory conversion as described in Section 9(b).  
(b) To exercise the mandatory conversion right described in Section 9(a) or
in Section 9(e), the Corporation shall issue a press release for publication
on the PR Newswire or an equivalent newswire service, if required by and in
accordance with the federal securities laws or the rules of any
stock exchange on which the Series A Preferred Stock or the Common Stock is
then listed or traded, prior to the opening of business on the first Trading
Day following any date on which the conditions described in Section 9(a) or
in Section 9(e), as applicable, are met, announcing such a mandatory
conversion whether or not a press release is issued, the Corporation shall
furnish notice of the Corporation\'s intention to mandatorily convert the
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock by first class mail to
each Holder or by publication (with subsequent prompt notice by first class
mail to each Holder), not later than the 15th day prior to the date on which
the mandatory conversion would occur (the "Mandatory Conversion Date"). The
Mandatory Conversion Date will be a date selected by the Corporation and will
be at least 15 days but no more than 30 days after the Corporation issues the
press release described in this Section 9(b), or if no press release is
issued, after mailing of the notice described in this Section 9(b) to the
Holders.   (c) In addition to any information required by applicable law
or regulation, the press release and notice of a mandatory conversion
described in Section 9(a) shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Mandatory
Conversion Date; (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon
conversion of each share of the Series A Preferred Stock; (iii) the number of
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted; and (iv) that
dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted will
cease to be payable on the Mandatory Conversion Date.   (d) On the
Mandatory Conversion Date, dividends will cease to be payable on the Series A
Preferred Stock, and all rights of any Holder with respect to the shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock, including the rights, if any, to receive
distributions of the Corporation\'s assets (including, but not limited to,
the Liquidation Preference) or notices from the Corporation, will terminate,
except only for the rights of any such Holder to (i) receive
physical certificates (if applicable) for the number of whole shares of
Common Stock into which such Holder\'s shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
have been converted and cash in lieu of any fractional share as provided in
Section 7, and (ii) exercise the rights to which he, she or it is entitled as
a holder of Common Stock into which such Holder\'s shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock have been mandatorily converted. Any dividend payment
declared by the Board of Directors with respect to the shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock called for a mandatory conversion on a date during the   
20  period between the close of business on any Record Date to the close of
business on the corresponding Dividend Payment Date will be payable on such
Dividend Payment Date to the Holder of such share on such Record Date if such
share has been converted after such Record Date and prior to such Dividend
Payment Date.   (e) In addition to the mandatory conversion right described
in Section 9(a), if there are less than 100,000 shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding, the Corporation shall have the right, at any
time on or after February 20, 2006, at its option, to cause each outstanding
share of the Series A Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that
number of whole shares of Common Stock equal to the lesser of (i) the
Conversion Ratio then in effect and (ii) the sum of (x) the Liquidation
Preference divided by the Market Value for the period ending on the second
Trading Day immediately prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date and (y) any
Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases to the Mandatory Conversion
Date. Any fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from such conversion
shall be settled in cash in accordance with Section 7.   (f) The provisions
of Sections 9(b) and 9(d) shall apply to any mandatory conversion pursuant to
Section 9(e). In addition to any information required by applicable law or
regulation, the press release and notice of a mandatory conversion described
in Section 9(e) shall state, as appropriate: (i) the Mandatory Conversion
Date; (ii) the number of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be
converted; (iii) that dividends on the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
to be converted will cease to be payable on the Mandatory Conversion Date;
(iv) the Conversion Ratio then in effect; and (v) that the number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of each share of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be equal to the lesser of the Conversion Ratio then in
effect and the sum of (x) the Liquidation Preference divided by the Market
Value for the period ending on the second Trading Day immediately prior to
the Mandatory Conversion Date and (y) any Accumulated Automatic Conversion
Ratio Increases to the Mandatory Conversion Date.   10. Mandatory
Redemption.   (a) On but not before February 15, 2014 (the "Mandatory
Redemption Date"), the Corporation shall be required to redeem, subject to
the legal availability of funds therefor, all outstanding shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock at a price in cash equal to the Liquidation
Preference thereof (the "Mandatory Redemption Price"). The Corporation shall
take all actions required or permitted under the laws of the State of
Delaware to permit such mandatory redemption.   (b) Upon mandatory
redemption pursuant to this Section 10, the Corporation shall not pay to the
Holders, and no Holder shall be entitled to, any additional amount per share
of the Series A Preferred Stock in excess of the Liquidation Preference to
compensate any such Holder for any Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio
Increases through the Mandatory Redemption Date.   (c) Unless the
Corporation defaults in the payment of the Mandatory Redemption Price, the
right of the Holders pursuant to Section 6 to convert shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock into Common Stock shall terminate at the close of business on
the Business Day    21  preceding the Mandatory Redemption Date,
dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will cease to be payable on and
after the Mandatory Redemption Date and all other rights of the Holders will
terminate on the Mandatory Redemption Date except for the right to receive
the Mandatory Redemption Price, without interest.   (d) The Corporation
will furnish written notice of the mandatory redemption by issuing a press
release for publication on the PR Newswire or an equivalent newswire service,
if required by and in accordance with the federal securities laws or the
rules of any stock exchange on which the Series A Preferred Stock or the
Common Stock is then listed or traded, and in any case by first class mail to
each Holder or by publication (with subsequent prompt notice by first class
mail to each Holder), at least 15 days in advance of the Mandatory Redemption
Date (the "Mandatory Redemption Notice"). In addition to any information
required by applicable law or regulation, the press release, if any, and
Mandatory Redemption Notice shall state, as appropriate:   (i) the Mandatory
Redemption Date;   (ii) the total number of shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock  to be mandatorily redeemed;   (iii) that each outstanding share of
the Series A Preferred Stock  will be redeemed for cash in an amount equal to
the Mandatory  Redemption Price;   (iv) that dividends on the Series A
Preferred Stock to be  mandatorily redeemed will cease to be payable on the
Mandatory  Redemption Date, unless the Corporation defaults in the  payment
of the Mandatory Redemption Price;   (v) that the right of the Holders to
voluntarily convert shares of  the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock
will terminate  at the close of business on the Business Day preceding the 
Mandatory Redemption Date, unless the Corporation defaults in  the payment of
the Mandatory Redemption Price;   (vi) the Conversion Ratio then in effect;
and   (vii) that if any shares of the Series A Preferred Stock held by any 
Holder are represented by one or more physical certificates,  such Holder
must surrender to the Corporation or the Transfer  Agent, in the manner and
at the place or places designated,  such physical certificate or certificates
representing the  shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed.  
(e) The mandatory redemption of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock not
represented by physical certificates will be effected through the facilities
of the Depositary as described in Section 14. Each Holder of one or more
physical certificates representing shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall surrender such physical certificate or certificates to the
Corporation or the Transfer Agent (properly endorsed or assigned for
transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the Mandatory Redemption
Notice shall so state), in the manner and at the place or places designated
in the Mandatory Redemption Notice, and the full Mandatory   
22  Redemption Price for such shares shall be payable in cash on the
Mandatory Redemption Date to the Holder, and each surrendered physical
certificate shall be canceled and retired.   (f) The Corporation shall
comply with any federal and state securities laws and regulations, to the
extent such laws and regulations are applicable, in connection with the
mandatory redemption.   11. Change of Control.   (a) Upon the occurrence
of a Change of Control (or if the Corporation has mailed or is required by
Section 11(d) to have mailed a notice with respect to a transaction described
in Section 1(d)(ii) that is for the purpose of changing the Corporation\'s
domicile to a location outside of the United States (a "Foreign Domicile
Change of Control")), each Holder shall, in the event that the Change of
Control Ratio (as defined below) is greater than the Conversion Ratio on the
Change of Control Date (or, in the case of a Foreign Domicile Change of
Control, on the date that is two Trading Days before the mailing of the
notice described in Section 11((d)), have a one-time option (the "Change of
Control Option") to convert all of such Holder\'s outstanding shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, each such share of the
Series A Preferred Stock being convertible into a number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the sum of (u) the Liquidation Preference divided by an
adjusted Conversion Price equal to the greater of (i) the Market Value for
the period ending on the Change of Control Date (or, in the case of a Foreign
Domicile Change of Control, the Market Value for the period ending on the
date that is two Trading Days before the mailing of the notice described in
Section 11(d)) and (ii) $2.6291 and (v) the amount of any Accumulated
Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases through the Change of Control Date (or,
in the case of a Foreign Domicile Change of Control, the amount of any
Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases through the Holder\'s date
of conversion pursuant to its exercise of the Change of Control Option). The
"Change of Control Ratio" shall equal the sum of (w) the Liquidation
Preference divided by the Market Value for the period ending on the Change of
Control Date (or, in the case of a Foreign Domicile Change of Control, the
Market Value for the period ending on the date that is two Trading Days
before the mailing of the notice described in Section 11 (d)) and (x) the
amount of any Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases through the
Change of Control Date (or, in the case of a Foreign Domicile Change of
Control, through the date that is two Trading Days before the mailing of
the notice described in Section 11(d)). In lieu of converting shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock upon any Holder\'s valid exercise
of the Change of Control Option, the Corporation may, at its option, redeem
each share of the Series A Preferred Stock for cash equal to the product of
(y) the Market Value for the period ending on the Change of Control Date (or,
in the case of a Foreign Domicile Change of Control, for the period ending on
the date that is two Trading Days before the mailing of the notice described
in Section 11(d)) and (z) the number of shares of Common Stock that would
have been issuable to such Holder upon conversion in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 11(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control in which each holder of the Common Stock
receives consideration consisting solely of common stock of the successor,
acquiror or other third party (and cash paid in lieu of fractional shares)
that is listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on the NNM and all
of the Common Stock has been exchanged for, converted into or acquired for
common stock of the successor, acquiror or other third party (and cash paid
in lieu of fractional shares), and shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
become    23  convertible solely into such common stock, the Conversion
Price will not be adjusted as described in this Section 11(a).   (b) The
Change of Control Option must be exercised, if at all, during the period of
not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days commencing on the third Business
Day after notice of a Change in Control has been given by the Corporation in
accordance with Section 11(c); provided, however, that in the case of a
Foreign Domicile Change of Control, the Change of Control Option must be
exercised, if at all, during the 15 consecutive day period ending on the
day immediately prior to the Change of Control Date commencing upon
the Corporation\'s delivery of a notice to the Holders in accordance with
Section 11(d).   (c) In the event of a Change of Control (other than a
Change of Control described in the last sentence of Section 11(a) or a
Foreign Domicile Change of Control), notice of such Change of Control shall
be given, within five Business Days of the Change of Control Date, by the
Corporation by first class mail to each Holder. Each such notice shall state
(i) that a Change of Control has occurred; (ii) the last day on which the
Change of Control Option may be exercised (with respect to any such Change of
Control, the "Expiration Date") pursuant to the terms of this Section 11; and
(iii) the procedures that Holders must follow to exercise the Change of
Control Option.   (d) In the event of a Foreign Domicile Change of Control,
notice of such Foreign Domicile Change of Control shall be given at least 15
days prior to the Change of Control Date by the Corporation by first class
mail to each Holder. Each such notice shall state (i) that a Foreign Domicile
Change of Control is pending; (ii) the expected Change of Control Date; (iii)
the last day on which the Change of Control Option may be exercised (with
respect to such Foreign Domicile Change of Control, the "Expiration Date")
pursuant to the terms of this Section 11; and (iv) the procedures that
Holders must follow to exercise the Change of Control Option.   (e) On or
before the Expiration Date, each Holder wishing to exercise the Change of
Control Option shall furnish to the Corporation or the Transfer Agent the
documentation requested in the notice described in Section 11(c) or 11(d), in
the manner and at the place or places designated in such notice. The
conversion or redemption of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock not
represented by physical certificates will be effected through the
facilities of the Depositary as described in Section 14. Each Holder of one
or more physical certificates representing shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall be required to surrender such physical certificate or
certificates to the Corporation or the Transfer Agent (properly endorsed or
assigned for transfer, if the Corporation shall so require and the notice
shall so state). The cash or shares of Common Stock due to such Holder, as
described in Section 11(a) , shall be delivered to the Holder and each
surrendered physical certificate shall be canceled and retired.   (f) The
rights of the Holders pursuant to this Section 11 are in addition to, and not
in lieu of, the voluntary conversion rights of the Holders provided for in
Section 6.   12. Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets.   (a) The
Corporation, without the consent of any Holder, may consolidate with or merge
into any other Person or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all
its assets to any    24  Person or may permit any Person to consolidate
with or merge into, or transfer or lease all or substantially all its
properties to, the Corporation; provided, however, that:   (i) subject to
the provisions of Section 11, the shares of the  Series A Preferred Stock
will become shares of such  successor, transferee or lessee, having in
respect of such  successor, transferee or lessee the same powers, 
preferences and relative participating, optional or other  special rights and
the qualification, limitations or  restrictions thereon, that the shares of
the Series A  Preferred Stock had immediately prior to such transaction; 
and   (ii) the Corporation delivers to the Transfer Agent an Officers\' 
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that such  transaction complies
with this Certificate of Incorporation.   (b) Upon any consolidation by the
Corporation with, or merger by the Corporation into, any other person or any
conveyance, transfer or lease of all or substantially all the assets of the
Corporation as described in Section 12(a), the successor resulting from such
consolidation or into which the Corporation is merged or the transferee or
lessee to which such conveyance, transfer or lease is made, will succeed to,
and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the
Corporation under the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, and thereafter,
except in the case of a lease, the predecessor (if still in existence) will
be released from its obligations and covenants with respect to the shares of
the Series A Preferred Stock.    13. SEC Reports. Whether or not the
Corporation is required to file reports with the SEC, if any shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Corporation shall file with the
SEC all such reports and other information as it would be required to file

Corporation shall supply each Holder, upon request, without cost to such
Holder, copies of such reports or other information.   14.
Certificates.   (a) The Series A Preferred Stock certificate shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A, which is hereby incorporated in, and
the form and terms thereof expressly made a part of, this Certificate of
Incorporation. The Series A Preferred Stock certificate may have notations,
legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to
which the Corporation is subject, if any, or usage (provided that any such
notation, legend or endorsement is in a form acceptable to the
Corporation).   (b) The Series A Preferred Stock shall initially be issued
only in the form of one or more fully registered global security certificates
("Global Security Certificates") with the global securities legend set forth
in Exhibit A hereto, registered in the name of Cede and Co., the nominee of The
Depository Trust Company, which will act as securities depositary (the
"Depositary") for the Series A Preferred Stock. The Global Security
Certificates will be deposited with the Depositary or its custodian. As long
as the Depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of the Global
Security Certificates, the Depositary or that nominee will be considered the
sole owner and holder of the Global Security Certificates and all of the
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented by those Global Security
Certificates for all purposes under the Series A Preferred Stock. Except if
the Depositary has notified the Corporation that it    25  is unwilling
or unable to continue as Depositary for the Global Security Certificates, has
ceased to be qualified to act or there is a continuing default by the
Corporation in respect of its obligations under the Series A Preferred Stock,
the Underwriting Agreement, this Certificate of Incorporation or any other
principal agreement or instrument executed in connection with the offering of
the Series A Preferred Stock, owners of beneficial interests in
Global Security Certificates will not be entitled to have the Global
Security Certificates or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock represented
by those certificates registered in their names, will not receive or be
entitled to receive physical certificates representing shares of the Series A
Preferred Stock in exchange and will not be considered to be owners or
holders of the Global Security Certificates or any of the shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock represented by the Global Security Certificates for
any purpose under the Series A Preferred Stock. All payments on shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock represented by the Global Security Certificates and
all related transfers and deliveries of Common Stock will be made to the
Depositary or its nominee as their holder.   (c) Except with respect to
shares of Series A Preferred Stock that nay be represented by physical
certificates issued by the Corporation from time to time, procedures for
conversion or redemption of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock in
accordance with the applicable provisions of this Certificate of
Incorporation will be governed by arrangements among the Depositary,
its participants and Persons that may hold beneficial interests through
its participants designed to permit the settlement without the physical
movement of certificates. Payments, transfers, deliveries, exchanges and
other matters relating to beneficial interests in Global Security
Certificates may be subject to various policies and procedures adopted by the
Depositary from time to time.   (d) If the Corporation issues any physical
certificate representing shares of the Series A Preferred Stock from time to
time and any such Series A Preferred Stock certificate shall be mutilated,
lost, stolen or destroyed, the Corporation shall, at the expense of the
Holder, issue, in exchange and in substitution for and upon cancellation of
the mutilated Series A Preferred Stock certificate, or in lieu of and
substitution for the Series A Preferred Stock certificate lost, stolen or
destroyed, a new Series A Preferred Stock certificate of like tenor and
representing an equivalent amount of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock,
but only upon receipt of evidence of such loss, theft or destruction of such
Series A Preferred Stock certificate and indemnity, if requested,
satisfactory to the Corporation and the Transfer Agent. The Corporation shall
not be required to issue any physical certificates representing shares of the
Series A Preferred Stock on or after any conversion date with respect to such
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. In place of the delivery of a
replacement certificate following any such conversion date, the Transfer
Agent, upon delivery of the evidence and indemnity described above, will
deliver the shares of Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Series
A Preferred Stock evidenced by the certificate.   15. Other Provisions.  
(a) With respect to any notice to a Holder required to be provided hereunder,
such notice shall be mailed to the registered address of such Holder, and
neither failure to mail such notice, nor any defect therein or in the mailing
thereof, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of the notice
or the validity of the proceedings referred to in such notice with respect to
the other Holders or affect the legality or validity of any
mandatory redemption,    26  mandatory conversion, distribution, rights,
warrant, reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation, winding-up or other action, or the vote upon any
action with respect to which the Holders are entitled to vote. All notice
periods referred to herein shall commence on the date of the mailing of the
applicable notice. Any notice which was mailed in the manner herein provided
shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the
Holder receives the notice.   (b) The shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be issuable, convertible and redeemable only in whole shares.   (c)
Any calculation of a dollar amount or number of shares of Common Stock
pursuant to any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation,
including, without limitation, the calculation of Accumulated Automatic
Conversion Ratio Increases, any Market Value, Discounted Current Market
Value, adjusted Conversion Price, Conversion Ratio, Change of Control Ratio
or Dividend Deficiency, shall be calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth of
a dollar or share.   (d) The Liquidation Preference and the annual dividend
rate set forth in Section 5(a) shall be subject to adjustment whenever there
shall occur a stock split, combination, reclassification or other similar
event involving shares of the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition,
Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases shall be subject to
adjustment whenever there shall occur a stock split, combination,
reclassification or other similar event involving the Common Stock. Such
adjustments shall be made in such manner and at such time as the Board of
Directors in good faith determines to be equitable in the circumstances, any
such determination to be evidenced in a resolution. Upon any such equitable
adjustment, the Corporation shall promptly deliver to the Transfer Agent and
each Holder an Officers\' Certificate attaching and certifying the resolution
of the Board of Directors, describing in reasonable detail the event
requiring the adjustment and the method of calculation thereof and specifying
the increased or decreased Liquidation Preference, annual dividend rate or
Accumulated Automatic Conversion Ratio Increases, and the Conversion Ratio,
in effect following such adjustment.   (e) Shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock issued and reacquired shall be retired and canceled promptly after
reacquisition thereof and, upon compliance with the applicable requirements
of Delaware law, have the status of authorized but unissued shares of
preferred stock of the Corporation undesignated as to series and may with any
and all other authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock of the
Corporation be designated or redesignated and issued or reissued, as the case
may be, as part of any series of preferred stock of the Corporation, except
that any issuance or reissuance of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
must be in compliance with this Certificate of Incorporation.   (f) The
Corporation covenants that it shall at all times reserve and keep available,
free from preemptive rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but
unissued shares of Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting conversion of
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Common
Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock not theretofore converted. For purposes of this
Section 15(f), the number of shares of Common Stock that shall be deliverable
upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be computed as if at the    27  time of computation all such
outstanding shares were held by a single Holder. The Corporation shall take
all action required to increase the authorized number of shares of Common
Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient unissued shares of Common
Stock to permit such reservation or to permit the conversion of all
outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock not
theretofore converted.   (g) The Corporation covenants that any shares of
Common Stock issued upon conversion of or in payment of any dividend on
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable.   (h) Prior to the delivery of any shares of Common
Stock or other securities that the Corporation shall be obligated to deliver
upon conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or the delivery of
any shares of Common Stock in payment of any dividend on shares of the Series
A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall comply with all federal and state
laws and regulations thereunder requiring the registration of such securities
with, or any approval of or consent to the delivery thereof by, any
governmental authority. Any share of Common Stock so delivered shall be
freely transferable under the Securities Act.   (i) The Corporation shall
list the shares of Common Stock required to be delivered upon conversion of
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock or in payment of any dividend on
shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, prior to such delivery, upon the NNM
and each other national securities exchange or quotation system, if any, upon
which the outstanding Common Stock is listed at the time of such
delivery.   (j) The Corporation shall pay any and all documentary stamp
or similar issue or transfer taxes payable in respect of the issue or
delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property upon
conversion of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of shares of Common
Stock or other securities or property in a name other than that of the Holder
of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to be converted and no such
issue or delivery shall be made unless and until the person requesting such
issue or delivery has paid to the Corporation the amount of any such tax or
established, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Corporation, that such tax
has been paid.   (k) The Holders as such are not entitled to any preemptive
or preferential right to purchase or subscribe to any capital stock,
obligations, warrants or other securities of the Corporation.   (l) Except
as may otherwise be required by law, the shares of the Series A Preferred
Stock shall not have any powers, designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, other than
those specifically set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation.  Article

directors or any vacancies in the Board of Directors resulting from death, 
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from office or other 
cause shall be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office, 
though less than a quorum, and directors so chosen shall hold office for a 
term expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders.   SECTION 5.
Removal. Any director, or the entire Board of Directors, may be  removed from

pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of the entire Board of
Directors.  Article 8. BYLAWS AMENDMENTS. The Board of Directors shall have
power to make, alter, amend and repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation (except

otherwise provide). Any Bylaws made by the Board of Directors under the
powers conferred hereby may be altered, amended or repealed by the Board of
Directors or by the stockholders.  Article 9. ACQUISITION PROPOSALS. In
determining whether an "acquisition proposal" is in the best interests of the
Corporation and its stockholders, the Board of Directors shall consider all
factors it deems relevant including, without limitation:   (a) the
consideration being offered in the acquisition proposal, not  only in
relation to the then current market price, but also in relation to  the then
current value of    29   the Corporation in a freely negotiated
transaction and in relation to the  Board of Directors\' estimate of the
future value of the Corporation as an  independent entity, and   (b) the
social, legal and economic effects upon employees,  suppliers, customers and
on the communities in which the Corporation is  located, as well as on the
long-term business prospects of the  Corporation.  "Acquisition proposal"
means any proposal of any person (i) for a tender offer, exchange offer or
any other method of acquiring any equity securities of the Corporation with a
view to acquiring control of the Corporation, (ii) to merge or consolidate
the Corporation with another corporation, (iii) to purchase or otherwise
acquire all or substantially all the properties and assets of
the Corporation.  This Section shall not be interpreted to create any
rights on behalf of third persons, such as employees, suppliers or
customers.  Article 10. INDEMNIFICATION.   SECTION 1. Elimination of
Certain Liability of Directors. A director of  the Corporation shall not be
personally liable to the Corporation or its  stockholders for monetary
damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a  director, except for liability (i)
for any breach of the director\'s duty  of loyalty to the Corporation or its
stockholders, (ii) for acts or  omissions not in good faith or which involve
intentional misconduct or a  knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section
174 of the Delaware General  Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction
from the director derived an  improper personal benefit.   SECTION 2.
Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) Right to Indemnification. Each person
who was or is made a party  or is threatened to be made a party to or is
involved in any action, suit  or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative  (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of
the fact that he or she, or a  person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director  or officer of the Corporation or, if a
director or officer of the  Corporation, is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a  director, officer, employee or agent of another
corporation or of a  partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
including service  with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis
of such  proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director
or  officer or in any other capacity while serving as a director or
officer,  shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
fullest  extent authorized by the Delaware General Corporation Law, as the
same  exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such 
amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation  to
provide broader indemnification rights than said law permitted the 
Corporation to provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, 
liability and loss (including attorneys\' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA 
excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) 
reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection therewith and 
such indemnification shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a 
director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, 
executors and administrators; provided, however, that    30   except as
provided in paragraph B hereof, the Corporation shall indemnify  any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding  (or part
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or  part thereof)
was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.  The right to
indemnification conferred in this Section shall be a contract  right and
shall include the right to be paid by the Corporation the  expenses incurred
in defending any such proceeding in advance of its final  disposition;
provided, however, that, if the Delaware General Corporation  Law requires,
the payment of such expenses incurred by a director or  officer in his or her
capacity as a director or officer (and not in any  other capacity in which
service was or is rendered by such person while a  director or officer,
including, without limitation, service to an employee  benefit plan) in
advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall  be made only upon
delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on  behalf of such
director or officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it  shall ultimately
be determined that such director or officer is not  entitled to be
indemnified under this Section or otherwise. The  Corporation may, by action
of its Board of Directors, provide  indemnification to employees and agents
of the Corporation with the same  scope and effect as the foregoing
indemnification of directors and  officers.   (b) Right of Claimant to
Bring Suit. If a claim under paragraph A of  this Section is not paid in full
by the Corporation within thirty days  after a written claim has been
received by the Corporation, the claimant  may at any time thereafter bring
suit against the Corporation to recover  the unpaid amount of the claim and,
if successful in whole or in part, the  claimant shall be entitled to be paid
also the expense of prosecuting such  claim. It shall be a defense to any
such action (other than an action  brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any  proceeding in advance of its final disposition
where the required  undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation)  that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which
make it  permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law for the
Corporation  to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden
of  proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure
of  the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, stockholders or 
independent legal counsel) to have made a determination prior to the 
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper 
in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of 
conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual 
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, 
stockholders or independent legal counsel) that the claimant has not met 
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or 
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard 
of conduct.   (c) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification
and the  payment of expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance of
its  final disposition conferred in this Section shall not be exclusive of
any  other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any 
statute, provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaw, agreement, 
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.   (d)
Insurance. The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its  expense, to
protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of  the
Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust  or
other enterprise against any such expense,    31   liability or loss,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to  indemnify such person
against such expense, liability or loss under the  Delaware General
Corporation Law.   SECOND: That, pursuant to a resolution of its Board of
Directors, a Special Meeting of the Stockholders of the Corporation was duly
called and held, upon notice in accordance with Section 222 of the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware at which meeting the necessary
number of shares required by Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware were voted in favor of the amendment.   THIRD: That
said amendment was duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of Section
242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.   IN WITNESS
WHEREOF, ANDREW CORPORATION has caused this certified to be signed by

EXHIBIT C   ________________, 2003  Andrew Corporation 10500 West 153rd
Street Orland Park, Illinois 60462 Attention: Vice President,
Law  Gentlemen:   I have been advised that as of the date of this letter I
may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Allen Telecom Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), as the term "affiliate" is defined for purposed
of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the
"Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act").
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of
February 17, 2003 (the "Agreement"), by and among Andrew Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Adirondacks, Inc., a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and the Company, Parent will
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") and the Company will
merge with and into Sub (the "Merger").   As a result of the Merger, I may
receive shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share of Parent ("Parent
Common Stock"). I would receive the Parent Common Stock in exchange for
shares (or options for shares) owned by me of Company Common Stock.   I
represent, warrant and covenant to Parent that in the event I receive Parent
Common Stock as a result of the Merger:   A. I shall not make any sale,
transfer or other disposition of the Parent  Common Stock in violation of the
Act or the Rules and Regulations.   B. I have carefully read this letter and
the Agreement and discussed the  requirements of such documents and other
applicable limitations upon my  ability to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of Parent Common Stock to  the extent I felt necessary, with my
counsel or counsel for the Company.   C. I have been advised that the
issuance of Parent Common Stock to me  pursuant to the Merger has been
registered with the Commission under the  Act on a Registration Statement
Form S-4. However, I have also been  advised that, because at the time the
Merger is submitted for a vote of  the stockholders of the Company, (a) I may
be deemed    1   to be an affiliate of the Company and (b) the
distribution by me of the  Parent Common Stock has not been registered under
the Act, I may not sell,  transfer or otherwise dispose of Parent Common
Stock issued to me in the  Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in  conformity with the limitations of Rule 145
promulgated by the Commission  under the Act, (ii) such sale, transfer or
other disposition has been  registered under the Act or (iii) in the opinion
of counsel reasonably  acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or other
disposition is  otherwise exempt from registration under the Act.   D. I
understand that Parent is under no obligation to register the sale,  transfer
or other disposition of the Parent Common Stock by me or on my  behalf under
the Act or to take any other action necessary in order to  make compliance
with an exemption from such registration available solely  as a result of the
Merger.   E. I also understand that there will be placed on the certificates
for the  Parent Common Stock issued to me, or any substitutions therefor, a
legend  stating in substance:   "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE
WERE ISSUED IN A  TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT  OF 1933 APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE
MAY ONLY  BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED 
____________, 2003 BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND ANDREW 
CORPORATION, A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL  OFFICES
OF ANDREW CORPORATION"   F. I also understand that unless a sale or transfer
is made in conformity  with the provisions of Rule 145, or pursuant to a
registration statement,  Parent reserves the right to put the following
