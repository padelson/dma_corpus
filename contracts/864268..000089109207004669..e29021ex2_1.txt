            (c) Capital  Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of common  stock,  par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective  Time shall be converted  into and become one (1) validly  issued,
fully paid and  nonassessable  share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of the Surviving  Corporation.  Following the Effective Time,  each  certificate
evidencing  ownership  of shares of  Merger  Sub  common  stock  shall  evidence
ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

            (d)  Adjustments.  If,  between the date of this  Agreement  and the
Effective  Time,  the number of Shares is  changed  into a  different  number of
shares   or  a   different   class,   by   reason   of   any   reclassification,
recapitalization,   stock  split,  stock  dividend,  subdivision,   combination,
exchange of shares, rights issuance or similar event, other than pursuant to the
Merger and in accordance with this Agreement,  the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change.

      Section 2.02 Surrender of Certificates.

            (a) Paying  Agent.  Prior to the  Effective  Time,  Parent shall (i)
select a bank or trust  company,  satisfactory  to the Company in its reasonable
discretion,  to act as the paying agent in the Merger (the  "Paying  Agent") and
(ii) enter into a paying agent  agreement  with the Paying Agent,  the terms and
conditions  of  which  are   satisfactory  to  the  Company  in  its  reasonable
discretion.

            (b) Exchange  Fund.  At the  Effective  Time,  on the Closing  Date,
Parent shall deposit (or cause to be  deposited)  funds with the Paying Agent in
amounts sufficient for the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration payable
under Section  2.01(a).  Such funds deposited with the Paying Agent are referred
to as the "Exchange Fund".

            (c) Payment Procedures.

                  (i) Letter of  Transmittal.  As promptly as practicable  after
      the  Effective  Time,  Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
      holder of record of a Share as of immediately  prior to the Effective Time
      (A) a letter of transmittal in customary  form,  specifying  that delivery
      shall be  effected,  and risk of loss and  title to such  holder's  Shares
      shall pass,  only upon proper  delivery of the  Certificates  representing
      such Shares to the Paying Agent and (B) instructions for surrendering such
      Certificates.

                  (ii)   Surrender  of   Certificates.   Upon   surrender  of  a
      Certificate  for  cancellation  to the Paying Agent,  together with a duly
      executed letter of transmittal and any other documents reasonably required
      by the Paying Agent, the holder of that  Certificate  shall be entitled to
      receive,  and the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange therefor,  the Merger
      Consideration payable in respect of the number of Shares evidenced by that
      Certificate.   Any   Certificates   so  surrendered   shall  be  cancelled
      immediately.  No interest  shall  accrue or be paid on any amount  payable
      upon surrender of Certificates.

                  (iii) Unregistered Transferees. If any Merger Consideration is
      to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
      Certificate is registered,  then the Merger  Consideration  may be paid to
      such  a  transferee  so  long  as  (A)  the  surrendered   Certificate  is
      accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect that transfer
      and (B) the Paying


                                       3
<PAGE>

      Agent shall be entitled to deduct any  applicable  transfer Taxes from the
      Merger Consideration in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.02(e),
      unless the Person requesting such payment  establishes to the satisfaction
      of the Paying  Agent that any such Taxes have already been paid or are not
      applicable.

                  (iv) No Other Rights.  Until  surrendered  in accordance  with
      this Section 2.02(c), each Certificate shall be deemed, from and after the
      Effective  Time,  to  represent  only the right to receive the  applicable
      Merger Consideration.  Any Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
      any Certificate  shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
      all rights pertaining to that Certificate and the shares of Company Common
      Stock or Company Class B Common Stock formerly represented by it.

            (d) No Further Transfers.  At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further  registration
of  transfers of the shares of Company  Common  Stock or Company  Class B Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

            (e)  Withholding  Rights.  Each of the Paying  Agent,  the Surviving
Corporation,  the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration  otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder of Shares or Company  Stock  Options  such amounts for Taxes as it is
required  to  deduct  and  withhold  with  respect  to such  payment  under  all
applicable  Tax Laws and pay such  withholding  amount  over to the  appropriate
Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying
Agent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case
may be,  such  withheld  amounts  shall  be  treated  for all  purposes  of this
Agreement  as having  been paid to the  holder of the  Shares or  Company  Stock
Options,  as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation,  the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub, as the case may be.

            (f) No Liability.  None of Parent, the Surviving  Corporation or the
Paying  Agent  shall be liable  to any  holder of  Certificates  for any  amount
properly paid to a public  official  under any  applicable  abandoned  property,
escheat or similar Laws.

            (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. As directed by Parent, the Exchange
Fund shall be  invested  by the Paying  Agent in (i) direct  obligations  of the
United States of America or (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit
of the  United  States of America  is  pledged  to  provide  for  payment of all
principal  and  interest.  Any  interest and other  income  resulting  from such
investment  shall become a part of the  Exchange  Fund and shall inure to Parent
for Tax purposes, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under Section
2.01(a) shall be paid to Parent upon  termination  of the Exchange Fund pursuant
to Section  2.02(h);  provided,  however,  that (i) no such investment or losses
thereon shall affect the Merger  Consideration  payable to the holders of Shares
and (ii) promptly following any losses that cause the Exchange Fund to then hold
less than the aggregate  Merger  Consideration  payable in respect of Shares for
which  payment  shall not  theretofore  have been made,  Parent  shall  promptly
provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders
of the Company to the extent that such losses have so caused the  Exchange  Fund
to hold less than the aggregate Merger Consideration  payable in respect of such
Shares for which payment has not theretofore  been made. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose  other than to fund payments due pursuant to Section
2.01.

            (h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Without limiting Parent's right to
receive  interest and other income in respect of the Exchange  Fund as described
in Section 2.02(g),  any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains  unclaimed by
the holders of Certificates twelve months after the


                                       4
<PAGE>

Effective  Time shall be  delivered  by the Paying  Agent to Parent upon demand.
Thereafter, any holder of Certificates who has not complied with this ARTICLE II
shall look only to Parent for payment of the applicable Merger Consideration.

            (i) Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed  Certificates.  If any Certificate is
lost,  stolen or destroyed,  upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting
by such Person of a bond in the form and amount reasonably required by Parent as
indemnity  against any claim that may be made  against  Parent on account of the
alleged loss, theft or destruction of such Certificate, the holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive, and the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange therefor, the
applicable Merger Consideration to such Person in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate.

      Section 2.03 Options and Warrants. (a) Except as otherwise agreed prior to
the Effective Time by Parent and the Company, immediately prior to the Effective
Time,  (i) all options to purchase  shares of Company Common Stock (the "Company
Stock Options")  granted under any plan,  arrangement or agreement (the "Company
Stock  Option  Plans")  shall be cancelled by the Company and shall no longer be
outstanding  thereafter.  In consideration for such cancellation (whether or not
the Company Stock Option was then vested and  exercisable),  the holder  thereof
shall thereupon be entitled to receive,  within 5 days after the Effective Time,
a cash payment  without  interest from the Surviving  Corporation  in respect of
such  cancellation  in an amount (if any) equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,  whether
or not then vested and  exercisable,  and (y) the excess,  if any, of the Merger
Consideration  over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company  Stock Option (the "Option  Consideration"),  reduced by any Tax
required to be withheld  with  respect to such  payment in  accordance  with the
provisions  of Section  2.02(e);  and (ii) the  Company  shall take all  actions
reasonably  requested  by Parent and shall use its  reasonable  best  efforts to
cause to be exercised  all  outstanding  warrants to purchase  shares of Company
Common  Stock  (the  "Company  Warrants")  that are not  exercised  prior to the
Effective Time.

            (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide notice to
each holder of Company  Stock Options  describing  the treatment of such Company
Stock Options under this Section 2.03.

            (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company,  in consultation  with
Parent,  shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any necessary  consents
to give effect to the  treatment of Company  Stock  Options as  contemplated  by
Section 2.03(a), to the extent that such treatment is not expressly provided for
by the terms of the applicable  Company Stock Option Plan, which consents may be
deemed  obtained upon  acceptance of the cash payments  contemplated  by Section
2.03(a) by the holders of such Company Stock  Options if such deemed  consent is
described  in the notice  required  under this Section 2.03 to such holders that
acceptance of such payments shall be treated as consent.

      Section 2.04 Dissenting Shares.

            (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company  Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock  outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time for which the holder thereof (i) has not
voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing and (ii) has demanded
the  appraisal  of such  shares in  accordance  with,  and has  complied  in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively,  the "Dissenting  Shares")
shall not be  converted  into the right to receive the Merger  Consideration  in
accordance  with Section  2.01(a).  At the Effective  Time,  (x) all  Dissenting
Shares  shall be  cancelled  and cease to exist and (y) the holder or holders of
Dissenting  Shares  shall be  entitled  only to such rights as may be granted to
them under Section 262 of the DGCL ("Section 262").


                                       5
<PAGE>

            (b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this Section  2.04, if any
holder of Dissenting Shares effectively withdraws or loses such appraisal rights
(through  failure to perfect  such  appraisal  rights or  otherwise),  then that
holder's  shares (i) shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting  Shares and (ii)
shall be treated as if they had been  converted  automatically  at the Effective
Time  into the right to  receive  the  Merger  Consideration,  without  interest
thereon,  upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares in
accordance  with Section  2.02.  In such event,  if the Exchange Fund shall then
remain  in  place,   Parent  shall  promptly  deposit  or  cause  the  Surviving
Corporation  to  deposit in the  Exchange  Fund the  aggregate  amount of Merger
Consideration in respect of such Dissenting Shares.

            (c) The Company  shall give Parent (i) prompt  notice of any demands
for  appraisal of any shares of Company  Common Stock or Company  Class B Common
Stock, the withdrawals of such demands,  and any other instrument  served on the
Company under the provisions of Section 262 and (ii) the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL.  The  Company  shall not offer or agree to make or make any  payment  with
respect  to any  demands  for  appraisal  or offer to settle or settle  any such
demands without the prior written consent of Parent.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      The Disclosure  Schedule attached hereto (the "Disclosure  Schedule") sets
forth, among other things,  items the disclosure of which is necessary either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or
as an exception to one or more of the  Company's  representations  or warranties
contained  in this  ARTICLE  III, or to one or more of the  Company's  covenants
contained in Section 5.01; provided,  however, that, notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary,  the mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to a  representation  or warranty or covenant shall not
be deemed an  admission  by the  Company  that such item  represents  a material
exception or material  fact,  event or  circumstance  or that such item would or
would  reasonably  be expected  to,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.  Notwithstanding that each disclosure set forth
in the  Disclosure  Schedule is  identified by reference to, or has been grouped
under a heading referring to, a specific  individual  section of this Agreement,
such disclosure shall be deemed a qualification or exception to such section and
also to any other sections to which its relevance is reasonably  apparent on its
face.

      Except as set forth in the Disclosure  Schedule and except as disclosed in
any forms, reports,  statements,  schedules,  certifications and other documents
(including  exhibits and any amendments) filed by the Company with, or furnished
by the Company to, the Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC") since January
1, 2007,  the Company  represents  and  warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as set
forth in 3.01 through Section 3.19 that:

      Section 3.01 Organization and  Qualification.  Each of the Company and the
Company  Subsidiaries is a corporation  duly organized,  validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its  business  as it is now being  conducted,  except  where the
failure to be in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a  Company  Material  Adverse  Effect.  The  Company  and  each  of the  Company
Subsidiaries  is duly  qualified  or  licensed  as a foreign  corporation  to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of the
properties  owned,  leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes
such  qualification  or licensing  necessary,  except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good  standing  would not,  individually  or in the
aggregate,  have a Company  Material Adverse Effect. A true and complete list of
all of the Company Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of incorporation
of each such


                                       6

Subsidiary,  is set forth in Section 3.01 of the Disclosure Schedule.  Except as

Subsidiaries  and the committees of each of such Boards of Directors (other than
the Special Committee), in each case held since January 1, 2004 and prior to the
date hereof.

      Section 3.02 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Company has made
available  to  Parent  a  complete  and  correct  copy  of  the  certificate  of

Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth,  as of the  Capitalization  Date, a summary of

paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive (or similar) rights.  With respect
to Company  Stock  Options,  (i) each grant of a Company  Stock  Option was duly
authorized  no later  than the date on which  the  grant of such  Company  Stock
Option was by its terms to be  effective  (the  "Grant  Date") by all  necessary
corporate action,  including, as applicable,  approval by the Board of Directors
of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized committee thereof) and any

            (c)  Each  outstanding  share  of  capital  stock  of  each  Company
Subsidiary is duly authorized,  validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
was issued free of preemptive (or similar) rights,  and each such share is owned
by the Company and/or by one (1) or more wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries, free
and clear of all Liens and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise  dispose of such capital stock or other equity  interests.  Except for
the capital stock of each of the Company Subsidiaries, the Company does not own,
directly or  indirectly,  any capital  stock of, or other voting  securities  or
equity interests in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture, association or
other entity.

      Section 3.04  Authority  Relative to This  Agreement.  The Company has all
necessary  corporate  power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  and  to  consummate  the  Merger.  The

limited  purpose entity or person,  on the other hand, or any "off balance sheet
arrangements"  (as defined in Item 303(a) of  Regulation  S-K under the Exchange

accordance with its terms,  and in compliance with the applicable  provisions of

noncompliance  would  not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  have a  Company
Material Adverse Effect,  and (ii) except as set forth in Section 3.10(e) of the

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

      Each of Parent and Merger Sub,  jointly and severally,  hereby  represents
and warrants to the Company that:

      Section 4.01  Corporate  Organization.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its  organization  and has the requisite  corporate power
and  authority  to own,  lease and  operate its  properties  and to carry on its
business  as it is now  being  conducted,  except  where  the  failure  to be so
organized,  existing  or in good  standing or to have such power  authority  and
governmental  approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate,  prevent or
materially delay  consummation of the Merger or otherwise  prevent or materially
delay either  Parent or Merger Sub from  performing  its  obligations  under the
Agreement.

      Section 4.02 Certificate of Incorporation  and Bylaws.  Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has  heretofore  furnished to the Company a complete and correct copy
of its certificate of incorporation  and bylaws,  as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement.  Such certificates of incorporation and bylaws are in full force
and effect.

      Section  4.03  Authority  Relative to this  Agreement.  Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all  necessary  corporate or other power and authority to execute
and  deliver  this  Agreement,  to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  and to

by each of Parent  and  Merger  Sub and the  consummation  by each of Parent and
Merger Sub of the Merger have been duly and validly  authorized by all necessary
corporate or other action,  and no other  corporate or other actions on the part
of Parent  or  Merger  Sub are  necessary  to  authorize  this  Agreement  or to
consummate  the Merger.  This  Agreement has been duly and validly  executed and
delivered  by each of Parent  and Merger Sub and,  assuming  due  authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company,  constitutes  a legal,  valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Merger Sub,  enforceable against each of Parent
and  Merger  Sub in  accordance  with its  terms,  subject  to the effect of any
general  principles of equity,  whether  applied in a court of law or a court of
equity,  and by bankruptcy,  insolvency  and similar Laws  affecting  creditors'
rights  and  remedies  generally,  including  all Laws  relating  to  fraudulent
transfers.

      Section 4.04 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.


                                       16
<PAGE>

            (a) The execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by each of Parent
and Merger Sub do not, and the  performance  of this Agreement by each of Parent
and  Merger  Sub and the  consummation  by each of Parent  and Merger Sub of the
Merger will not, (i) contravene, conflict with, violate or result in a breach of
the respective  certificates of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub,
(ii)  assuming that all consents,  approvals,  authorizations  and other actions
described  in Section  3.05(b) and Section  4.04(b)  have been  obtained and all
filings and obligations  described in Section  4.04(b) have been made,  conflict
with or violate  any Law  applicable  to either  Parent or Merger  Sub, or (iii)
result in any  breach or  violation  of, or  constitute  a default  (or an event
which,  with notice or lapse of time or both,  would become a default) under, or
give  to  others  any  rights  of   termination,   amendment,   acceleration  or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset of
either  Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to any Contract to which either  Parent or
Merger  Sub is a party or by  which  either  Parent  or  Merger  Sub is bound or
affected,  except,  with  respect  to  clauses  (ii)  and  (iii),  for any  such
conflicts,  violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate,  prevent or materially  delay  consummation of
the Merger or otherwise  prevent or materially delay either Parent or Merger Sub
from performing their obligations under this Agreement.

            (b) The execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by each of Parent
and Merger Sub do not, and the  performance  of this Agreement by each of Parent
and  Merger  Sub and the  consummation  by each of Parent  and Merger Sub of the
Merger will not, require any consent,  approval,  authorization or permit of, or
filing  with or  notification  to, any  Governmental  Authority,  except for (i)
applicable  requirements,  if any,  of the  Exchange  Act,  (ii) the  pre-merger
notification  requirements  of the HSR Act and the competition or merger control
Laws of any other applicable  jurisdiction,  (iii) the filing and recordation of
appropriate  merger documents as required by the DGCL and appropriate  documents
with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company or any of the
Company  Subsidiaries  is qualified to do business,  (iv) the filing of required
applications  and notices  with the FDA and (v) where the failure to obtain such
consents,  approvals,  authorizations  or  permits,  or to make such  filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate prevent or materially
delay consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent or materially delay either
Parent or Merger Sub from performing their obligations under this Agreement.

      Section 4.05 Absence of Litigation.  There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Merger Sub,  threatened,  against either Parent or Merger
Sub before any Governmental Authority that would or seeks to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is subject
to any  continuing  order of,  consent  decree,  settlement  agreement  or other
similar  written  agreement with, or, to the knowledge of Parent and Merger Sub,
continuing  investigation by, any Governmental  Authority,  or any order,  writ,
judgment,  injunction,  decree,  determination  or  award  of  any  Governmental
Authority that would or seeks to materially delay or prevent the consummation of
the Merger.

      Section 4.06  Operations of Merger Sub;  Ownership of Company Common Stock
and Company Class B Common  Stock.  Merger Sub was formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  has engaged in no other
business  activities,  and has conducted its operations  only as contemplated by
this  Agreement.  Merger Sub has no  subsidiaries.  No shares of Company  Common
Stock or Company Class B Common Stock are held by Parent,  Merger Sub, Guarantor
or any direct or  indirect  wholly  owned  subsidiary  of Parent,  Merger Sub or
Guarantor.

      Section 4.07 Financing. Parent and Merger Sub will have available to them,
at the Effective Time,  immediately  available funds necessary to consummate the
Merger in accordance  with this  Agreement.  Parent has delivered to the Company
true,  complete and correct copies of executed  equity  commitment  letters (the
"Equity  Financing  Commitments"  or the "Financing  Commitments"),  pursuant to
which Avista  Capital  Partners GP, LLC,  Avista  Capital  Partners,  LP, Avista
Capital Partners (Offshore),


                                       17
<PAGE>

LP, DLJ Merchant  Banking III,  Inc.,  DLJ Merchant  Banking IV (Cayman),  L.P.,
Nordic  Capital VI Limited,  NC VI Limited and Nordic  Industries  Limited  have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest and/or provide
loans  in  the  amount  set  forth  therein  (the  "Equity   Financing"  or  the
"Financing").  Each of the  Equity  Financing  Commitments  is in full force and
effect and is a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of Parent and of the other
parties thereto.  None of the Financing  Commitments has been or will be amended
or modified, except as permitted by Section 6.14, and the respective commitments
contained in the Financing  Commitments  have not been withdrawn or rescinded in
any respect as of the date hereof.  No event has occurred which, with or without
notice,  lapse of time or both,  would constitute a material default or material
breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any  Financing  Commitment  and
neither  Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe  that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely  basis any  material  term or  condition of closing to be
satisfied by it in any of the Financing Commitments on or prior to the Effective
Time,  any  "subsequent  offering  period"  and the Closing  Date.  There are no
precedent conditions related to the funding or investing, as applicable,  of the
full  amount  of  the  Financing  other  than  as  expressly  set  forth  in  or
contemplated  by the Financing  Commitments.  There are no side letters or other
agreements,  contracts or  arrangements  (except for  customary  fee letters and
engagement letters) related to the funding or investing,  as applicable,  of the
full  amount  of  the  Financing  other  than  as  expressly  set  forth  in  or
contemplated by the Financing  Commitments.  The aggregate proceeds contemplated
by the Financing Commitments plus Parent's cash on hand (excluding the Company's
cash on  hand)  will be  sufficient  for  Parent  and/or  Merger  Sub to pay the
aggregate  Merger  Consideration  and any other repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated  by the  Financing  Commitments  and to pay all  related  fees  and
expenses.  Parent  has  fully  paid any and all  commitment  fees that have been
incurred and are due and payable in connection  with the Financing  Commitments,
and  Parent  will pay when due all  other  commitment  fees  arising  under  the
Financing Commitments as and when they become payable.

Section  4.08  Solvency.   Immediately   after  giving  effect  to  all  of  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  including  the  payment  of the
aggregate  Merger  Consideration,  and payment of all related fees and expenses,
the  Surviving  Corporation  on a  consolidated  basis  will be  Solvent  at the
Effective  Time. For the purposes of this Agreement,  the term  "Solvent",  when
used with respect to any Person,  means that,  as of any date of  determination,
(a) the amount of the "fair  saleable  value" of the assets of such Person will,
as of such  date,  exceed  (x) the  value of all  "liabilities  of such  Person,
including  contingent  and other  liabilities",  as of such date, as such quoted
terms are  generally  determined  in  accordance  with  applicable  federal laws
governing  determinations of the insolvency of debtors,  and (y) the amount that
will be required to pay the probable  liabilities of such Person on its existing
debts  (including  contingent  liabilities)  as such debts  become  absolute and
matured,  (b) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably  small
amount of capital for the operation of the  businesses in which it is engaged or
proposed to be engaged  following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to
pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

      Section 4.09 Brokers. Unless the Closing occurs and except as contemplated
by  Section  8.03,  the  Company  shall not be  responsible  for any  brokerage,
finder's or other fee or commission to any broker,  finder or investment  banker
in connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of either Parent or Merger Sub.

      Section 4.10 No Other Information.  Except as set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Company makes no  representations  or
warranties  as to any matter  whatsoever  except as expressly  set forth in this
Agreement,  including  with  respect to any  projections,  estimates  or budgets
discussed  with,  delivered to or made  available to Parent and Merger Sub or to
any of their respective  Affiliates or any  representatives  of future revenues,
future  results of operations (or any component  thereof),  future cash flows or
future financial condition (or any component thereof) of the


                                       18
<PAGE>

Company and the Company Subsidiaries or of the future business and operations of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

      Section 4.11 Guaranty.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
Parent has  delivered  to the  Company the  Guaranty,  dated the date hereof and
executed  by  the  Guarantor,  in  favor  of the  Company  with  respect  to the
performance by Parent and Merger Sub,  respectively,  of their obligations under
this Agreement.

                            COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES

Section 6.01 Proxy Statement.

            (a) The Company  shall  prepare and file with the SEC as promptly as
practicable,  the preliminary Proxy Statement.  Each of the Company,  Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly obtain and furnish all information  concerning  itself
and its  Affiliates  that is required to be included in the Proxy  Statement  or
that is customarily  included in proxy  statements  prepared in connection  with
transactions of the type  contemplated  by this Agreement.  Each of the Company,
Parent  and  Merger  Sub shall use its  reasonable  best  efforts  to respond as
promptly as  practicable  to any  comments of the SEC with  respect to the Proxy
Statement  and the Company  shall use its  reasonable  best efforts to cause the
definitive  Proxy  Statement  to be  mailed  to the  Company's  stockholders  as
promptly as  reasonably  practicable  after the SEC clears the Proxy  Statement.
Each party  shall  promptly  notify the other  parties  upon the  receipt of any
comments  from the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for
amendments  or  supplements  to the Proxy  Statement and shall provide the other
parties with copies of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on
the one hand,  and the SEC and its staff,  on the other  hand,  relating  to the
Proxy  Statement.  If, at any time prior to the Effective  Time, any information
relating  to  the  Company,  Parent,  Merger  Sub or  any  of  their  respective
Affiliates,  officers or directors,  should be discovered by the Company, Parent
or Merger Sub which  should be set forth in an amendment  or  supplement  to the
Proxy  Statement,  so that the Proxy  Statement  shall not  contain  any  untrue
statement of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the  circumstances  under which they are made,  not  misleading,  the party that
discovers  such  information  shall promptly  notify the other  parties,  and an
appropriate  amendment or supplement  describing such information shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,  disseminated to the
stockholders  of the Company.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  stated
above,  prior to filing or mailing  the Proxy  Statement  (or any  amendment  or
supplement  thereto)  or  responding  to any  comments  of the SEC with  respect
thereto,  the Company  shall  provide  Parent and Merger Sub an  opportunity  to
review  and  comment  on the  Proxy  Statement  and shall  include  in the Proxy
Statement comments reasonably proposed by Parent and Merger Sub.

            (b) The Proxy  Statement that is filed by the Company will comply as
to form in all material  respects with the  requirements of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder.  The Company hereby covenants
and agrees that none of the information included or incorporated by reference in
the Proxy  Statement  to be made by the  Company  will,  at the date it is first
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders'
Meeting or at the time


                                       21
<PAGE>

of any  amendment  or  supplement  thereof,  contain any untrue  statement  of a
material fact or omit to state any material  fact required to be stated  therein
or  necessary  in  order  to  make  the  statements  therein,  in  light  of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no covenant
is made by the  Company  with  respect to  statements  made or  incorporated  by
reference  therein based on information  supplied by Parent or Merger Sub or any
Affiliate  of Parent or Merger Sub in  connection  with the  preparation  of the
Proxy Statement for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.  Parent and
Merger Sub hereby  covenant and agree that none of the  information  supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub or any  Affiliate of Parent or Merger Sub for  inclusion or
incorporation  by reference in the Proxy  Statement will at the date it is first
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders'
Meeting or at the time of any  amendment  or  supplement  thereof,  contain  any
untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the statements  therein,  in
light of the  circumstances  under  which  they are  made,  not  misleading.  No
covenant is made by either Parent or Merger Sub with respect to statements  made
or  incorporated  by  reference  therein  based on  information  supplied by the
Company in connection  with the preparation of the Proxy Statement for inclusion
or incorporation by reference therein.

      Section  6.02  Company  Stockholders'   Meeting.  The  Company  shall  use
reasonable best efforts to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of  its  stockholders   (including  any  adjournments   thereof,   the  "Company
Stockholders' Meeting"), as promptly as practicable after the SEC indicates that
it has no further comments on the Proxy  Statement,  and in any event shall hold
the  Company  Stockholders'  Meeting  within 30  Business  Days  after the Proxy
Statement  is mailed to its  stockholders,  for the  purpose of voting  upon the
adoption of this Agreement. Subject to a Change in Board Recommendation effected
in accordance with Section  6.04(e),  (i) the Company shall include in the Proxy
Statement the Company Board's  recommendation  described in Section 3.15(a) that
holders of Shares adopt this  Agreement and the Merger and (ii) the Company will
use reasonable best efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the  adoption of this  Agreement  and the Merger and will take all other  action
reasonably  necessary or advisable to secure the Stockholder  Approval.  For the
avoidance  of doubt,  the  Company  shall not be  required  to hold the  Company
Stockholders' Meeting if this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
Section 8.01.

      Section 6.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

            (a) Except as otherwise  prohibited  by  applicable  Law or as would
result in a waiver of any  attorney-client  privilege (it being  understood that
the parties shall make appropriate  substitute disclosure  arrangements to cause
such information to be provided, if reasonably practicable,  in a manner that is
not reasonably likely to result in such waiver), from the date of this Agreement
until the  Effective  Time,  the  Company  shall  (and shall  cause the  Company
Subsidiaries to): provide to Parent and to the officers,  directors,  employees,
accountants,  legal counsel,  investment  bankers,  financing  sources and other
representatives  (collectively,  "Representatives") of Parent reasonable access,
during normal business hours and, upon reasonable prior notice by Parent, to the
officers, employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and
the Company  Subsidiaries  and use reasonable  best efforts to provide to Parent
and its  Representatives  reasonable  access,  during normal business hours and,
upon reasonable prior notice by Parent, to the books and records thereof.

            (b) Nothing in this Section 6.03 shall require the Company to permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information,  that in the reasonable judgment
of the Company would violate any of its respective  obligations  with respect to
confidentiality;   provided,   that  the  Company  shall  use  its  commercially
reasonable  efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection
or disclosure.

            (c)  All  information  obtained  by  Parent  or its  Representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall be kept  confidential in accordance with the
Non-Disclosure  Agreement,  dated July 16, 2007  between  Parent and the Company
(the "Confidentiality Agreement").

      Section 6.04 No Solicitation.

            (a) Except as expressly permitted by Section 6.04(b),  from the date
hereof  until the  Effective  Time or the  termination  of this  Agreement,  the
Company shall not, nor shall the Company permit any of the Company  Subsidiaries
or their respective  Representatives  to, (A) solicit,  initiate,  facilitate or
knowingly encourage  (including by way of furnishing  non-public  information or
providing access to its properties,  books,  records or personnel) any inquiries
regarding,  or the making of any  proposal or offer that  constitutes,  or could
reasonably  be expected  to lead to, an  Acquisition  Proposal,  or (B) have any
discussions  (other  than to state  that the  Company is not  permitted  to have
discussions)  or  participate  in  any  negotiations  regarding  an  Acquisition
Proposal,  or execute or enter into any agreement,  understanding or arrangement
with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal,  or approve or recommend or propose to
approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or any agreement,  understanding or
arrangement  relating  to  an  Acquisition  Proposal.  Upon  execution  of  this
Agreement,  the Company shall  immediately  cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any Person conducted
theretofore   by  the  Company,   the  Company   Subsidiaries   or  any  of  its
Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

            (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.04(a), if, at any time after execution
of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Stockholder  Approval and following
the receipt by the Company of a bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal from any
Person,  which  Acquisition  Proposal was made after the date hereof and did not
result, directly or indirectly,  from a breach of this Section 6.04, the Company
Board determines in good faith by a majority vote of the  disinterested  members
thereof,  after  consultation with financial  advisors of nationally  recognized
reputation,  and,  with  respect to the matters  covered by clause  (iii) of the
definition  of "Superior  Proposal"  set forth in Section  6.04(g),  its outside
legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected  to lead to a  Superior  Proposal,  the  Company  may,  if its Board of
Directors  determines  in good  faith by a  majority  vote of the  disinterested
members thereof (after  consultation  with its outside legal counsel) that it is
reasonably  likely to be required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the  shareholders of the Company under  applicable Law, in response to
such  Acquisition  Proposal,  subject to compliance  with this Section 6.04, and
after  giving  notice to Parent  (x)  furnish  information  with  respect to the
Company to the  Person who has made such  Acquisition  Proposal  pursuant  to an
Acceptable  Confidentiality  Agreement,  a copy of which  shall be  provided  to
Parent,  (provided that all such  information  has  previously  been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent  substantially  concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person) and (y)  participate  in discussions  and  negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal. From and after the date hereof, the Company
shall  advise  Parent  orally and in writing of the  receipt of any  Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any  Acquisition  Proposal (in each case within three  business days of
receipt  thereof)  specifying the material terms and conditions  thereof and the
identity of the person or persons making such  Acquisition  Proposal or inquiry.
The Company agrees that it and the Company  Subsidiaries will not enter into any
confidentiality  agreement  with any Person  subsequent to the date hereof which
prohibits the Company from providing such information to Parent.  From and after
the date hereof,  the Company shall (i) keep Parent  reasonably  informed,  on a
reasonably  prompt basis,  of the status and material  terms of any  Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry  (including any material  modifications  to the financial or
other material terms of any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry) and (ii) provide to
Parent as soon as practicable  after receipt or delivery  thereof with copies of
all material  correspondence  and other written material sent or provided to the
Company or any  Company  Subsidiary  from any person that  describes  any of the
terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal.


                                       23

            (c)  Except as set forth in Section  6.04(d)  and  Section  6.04(e),
neither  the  Company  Board  nor  any  committee  thereof  shall,  directly  or
indirectly,  (i) withdraw or modify,  or propose publicly to withdraw or modify,
or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the approval or
recommendation  by the  Company  Board of the  Merger and this  Agreement;  (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or resolve to
approve or recommend,  any Acquisition  Proposal (any of the actions referred to
in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), whether taken by the Company Board or any
committee  thereof,  a  "Change  in Board  Recommendation");  (iii)  approve  or
recommend or allow the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries to enter into
any  letter  of  intent,  acquisition  agreement  or any  similar  agreement  or
understanding  (A)  constituting  or related to, or that is intended to or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition  Proposal or (B) requiring it
to abandon,  terminate  or fail to  consummate  the  Merger;  or (iv) effect any
transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal.

            (d) Notwithstanding Section 6.04(c), the Company Board may, prior to
obtaining the Stockholder  Approval, in response to a Superior Proposal received
by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement,  terminate this Agreement
to enter into an agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal.

            (e) Notwithstanding  Section 6.04(c), at any time prior to obtaining
the  Stockholder  Approval,  if the Company Board  determines in good faith by a
majority  vote of the  disinterested  members of the Board of  Directors  (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally
recognized  reputation) that it is reasonably  likely to be required to do so in
order to comply with its  fiduciary  duties to the  shareholders  of the Company
under  applicable  Law,  then the  Company  Board  may  make a  Change  in Board
Recommendation, provided, however, no Change in Board Recommendation may be made
until after the third business day following  Parent's receipt of written notice
(a "Notice of Change in Board  Recommendation") from the Company advising Parent
that the Board of Directors  of the Company  intends to take such action and, if
applicable,  specifying  all  material  terms  and  conditions  of any  Superior
Proposal that is the basis of the proposed  action by the Board of Directors (it
being  understood  and agreed that any amendment to the  financial  terms or any
other  material  term of such  Superior  Proposal  shall require a new Notice of
Change  in  Board  Recommendation  and a new  three  business  day  period).  In
determining  whether  to make a Change  in Board  Recommendation,  the  Board of
Directors  of the  Company  shall take into  account any changes to the terms of
this  Agreement  proposed  by Parent in  response to a Notice of Change in Board
Recommendation or otherwise.

            (f)  Nothing  contained  in this  Section  6.04 shall  prohibit  the
Company from complying with Rules 14a-9,  14d-9 or 14e-2  promulgated  under the
Exchange Act, or making any required  disclosure  to the Company's  stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with its
outside  legal  counsel,  the  failure to do so would be  inconsistent  with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or is otherwise  required under applicable
Law;  provided,  however,  that,  in any event,  the Company  Board shall not be
permitted to (i) make a Change in Board Recommendation or (ii) take any position
under Rule 14e-2(a) other than recommending rejection of such tender or exchange
offer, in each case,  unless it has complied with all of its  obligations  under
this Section 6.04.

            (g) For purposes of this Agreement:

                  (i)   "Acceptable   Confidentiality   Agreement"   means   any
      confidentiality  agreement on terms no less  favorable in the aggregate to
      the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and with
      a  standstill  of duration  no shorter  than and with  exceptions  to such
      standstill   not   materially   broader   than  those   contained  in  the
      Confidentiality Agreement between Parent and the Company;


                                       24

                  (ii)  "Acquisition  Proposal"  means  any  proposal  or  offer
      (whether or not  binding)  from any Person or group (other than Parent and
      its  Affiliates)  relating  to (i) any direct or indirect  acquisition  or
      purchase  of (A) 20% or more of the assets of the  Company and the Company
      Subsidiaries,  taken as a  whole,  (B) 20% or more of the  Company  Common
      Stock then  outstanding,  (C) more than 50% of the Company  Class B Common
      Stock then outstanding or (D) 25% or more of the equity  securities of any
      Company  Subsidiary  then  outstanding,  (ii) any tender offer or exchange
      offer that if consummated would result in any Person  beneficially  owning
      (A) 20% or more of the Company  Common  Stock then  outstanding,  (B) more
      than 50% of the Company Class B Common Stock then  outstanding  or (C) 25%
      or  more  of  the  equity  securities  of  any  Company   Subsidiary  then
      outstanding,  or (iii) any merger,  consolidation,  business  combination,
      recapitalization,   liquidation,   dissolution   or  similar   transaction
      involving the Company,  other than the  transactions  contemplated by this
      Agreement; and

                  (iii)   "Superior   Proposal"  means  any  bona  fide  written
      Acquisition  Proposal  not  solicited  or  initiated  in violation of this
      Section  6.04  that (i)  relates  to an  acquisition  by a Person or group
      acting in concert of either (A) more than 50% of the equity  interests  of
      the Company  pursuant to a tender  offer,  merger or otherwise or (B) more
      than 50% of the assets used in the conduct of the  business of the Company
      and the Company Subsidiaries,  taken as a whole, (ii) the Company Board by
      a vote of a majority of  disinterested  directors  determines  in its good
      faith  judgment  (after  consultation  with outside  counsel and financial
      advisors of  nationally  recognized  reputation)  would,  if  consummated,
      result  in  a  transaction   that  is  more  favorable  to  the  Company's
      stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders)  from a financial point
      of view than the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  and (iii)
      the Company Board  determines in good faith (after  consultation  with its
      financial  advisors of nationally  recognized  reputation  and its outside
      legal counsel) is reasonably capable of being consummated.

      Section 6.05 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.

            (a) For a period  of six  years  after the  Effective  Time,  unless
otherwise  required by applicable  Law, the  certificate  of  incorporation  and
bylaws of the Surviving  Corporation and the Company  Subsidiaries shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to the indemnification and exculpation
of directors and officers than are set forth in the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws of the Company (or the relevant  Company  Subsidiary)  as in effect on
the date  hereof.  From and after the  Effective  Time,  Parent  shall cause the
Surviving  Corporation,  to the fullest extent  permitted  under  applicable Law
(including to the greatest  extent  authorized or permitted by any amendments to
or  replacements  of the DGCL  adopted  after  the date of this  Agreement  that
increase  the extent to which a  corporation  may  indemnify  its  officers  and
directors), to indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each
of the foregoing) each present and former  director,  officer or employee of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary  (collectively,  the "Indemnified Parties"),
in and to the extent of their  capacities as such and not as stockholders of the
Company or any Company  Subsidiary,  against  any costs or  expenses  (including
advancing  attorneys'  fees and expenses in advance of the final  disposition of
any claim,  suit,  proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified  Party to the
fullest extent permitted by Law),  judgments,  fines, losses,  claims,  damages,
liabilities  and amounts paid in settlement  (with the consent of Parent,  which
consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld) in  connection  with any actual or
threatened Action,  arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action
or omission  occurring or alleged to have  occurred  before or at the  Effective
Time  (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as an
officer,  director or other  fiduciary  in any entity if such service was at the
request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such Action, the
Surviving  Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense
of such Action.


                                       25
<PAGE>

            (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) after consultation
with the Company, either (A) cause to be obtained from an insurance carrier with
the same or better rating as the Company's current  insurance  carriers prior to
the Effective Time a fully prepaid "tail"  insurance policy with a claims period
of at least six years from the  Effective  Time with respect to  directors'  and
officers'  liability  insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Company's  existing  policies  for  claims  arising  from  facts or events  that
occurred prior to the Effective Time or (B) maintain the existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies maintained by the Company for a period of
six years after the Effective Time and (ii) deliver to the Company,  at or prior
to the Closing,  written  evidence  satisfactory to the Company of compliance by
Parent with the provisions of the foregoing  clause (i) of this Section 6.05(b);
provided  however,  that Parent  shall not be  obligated  to pay for such "tail"
insurance  policy (or, if the foregoing  clause (B) is applicable,  shall not be
obligated to pay in any one year) more than 300% of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company for such insurance coverage; and provided,  further, that if
the  premiums  for such  "tail"  insurance  policy (or,  if  applicable,  annual
premiums  for the  insurance  coverage  described in the  foregoing  clause (B))
exceed 300% of such annual premium  currently paid by the Company,  Parent shall
obtain a policy with the greatest  coverage  available  for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

            (c) This Section 6.05 shall survive the  consummation  of the Merger
and  continue in full force and effect and is intended to benefit,  and shall be
enforceable   as  third  party   beneficiaries   by  each   Indemnified   Person
(notwithstanding  that such Persons are not parties to this Agreement) and their
respective heirs and legal  representatives.  The  indemnification  provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified
Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

            (d) If Parent or the Surviving  Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) shall  consolidate  with or merge into any other  corporation  or
entity and shall not be the  continuing  or surviving  corporation  or entity of
such  consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially  all of its properties and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions  shall be made so that the  successors  and  assigns of Parent or the
Surviving  Corporation  and the transferee or transferees of such properties and
assets,  as applicable,  shall assume all of the  obligations  set forth in this
Section 6.05.

            (e) Nothing in this  Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall  release,  waive or impair  any  rights  to  directors'  and  officers'
insurance  claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect
to the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided  for in this Section  6.05 is not prior to or in  substitution  for any
such claims under any such policies.

      Section 6.06 Employee Benefits Matters.

            (a) Parent  hereby  agrees that,  for a period of one year after the
Effective  Time, it shall,  or it shall cause the Surviving  Corporation and its
subsidiaries  to,  provide,  in the aggregate,  employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, with salaries,  employee benefits
and incentive compensation  opportunities (other than equity-based compensation)
that are  substantially  comparable in the  aggregate to those  provided to such
employees  immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time,  Parent shall cause the  Surviving  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries  to
comply  with the terms of  (including  terms  which  provide  for  amendment  or
termination)  all  contracts,  agreements,  arrangements,  policies,  plans  and
commitments of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, including the Company's
Retention  Plan, as in effect  immediately  prior to the Effective Time that are
applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary.


                                       26
<PAGE>

            (b)  Employees  of the Company and the  Company  Subsidiaries  shall
receive  credit  for  service  accrued  or  deemed  accrued  on or  prior to the
Effective  Time with the  Company or any  Company  Subsidiary  for all  purposes
(including for purposes of eligibility to participate,  vesting, benefit accrual
and eligibility to receive  benefits,  but excluding  benefit accruals under any
defined  benefit  pension  plan) under any  employee  benefit  plan,  program or
arrangement  established or maintained by Parent,  the Surviving  Corporation or
any of their  respective  subsidiaries  under  which each such  employee  may be
eligible  to  participate  on or after  the  Effective  Time to the same  extent
recognized by the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries  under  comparable
Plans  immediately  prior to the Effective Time;  provided,  however,  that such
crediting of service  shall not operate to duplicate  any benefit or the funding
of any such benefit.

            (c)  With  respect  to  the  welfare  benefit  plans,  programs  and
arrangements maintained,  sponsored or contributed to by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation  ("Purchaser  Welfare Benefit Plans") in which an active employee of
the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries  may become eligible to participate in
following the Effective  Time,  Parent shall (i) waive,  or use reasonable  best
efforts  to  cause  its  insurance  carrier  to  waive,  all  limitations  as to
preexisting and at-work  conditions,  if any, with respect to participation  and
coverage  requirements  applicable  to  each  such  active  employee  under  any
Purchaser  Welfare  Benefit  Plan to the same extent  waived  under a comparable
Plan, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible  expenses  incurred
by any  employee  of the  Company  or the  Company  Subsidiaries  and his or her
covered  dependents  under  comparable  Plans during the plan year in which such
individuals move to a comparable Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to be taken into
account under the Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying all
deductible,  coinsurance and maximum  out-of-pocket  requirements  applicable to
such  employee  and his or her  dependents  as if such  amounts had been paid in
accordance  with the Purchaser  Welfare  Benefit Plans,  and (iii) waive, or use
reasonable  best efforts to cause its  insurance  carrier to waive,  any waiting
period  limitation or evidence of insurability  requirement that would otherwise
be applicable to an employee of the Company or the Company  Subsidiaries and his
or her eligible  dependents on or after the Effective  Time during the plan year
in which such individuals move to a comparable Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan.

            (d) Without  limiting the generality of the foregoing,  no provision
of this  Agreement  shall  create  any  third  party  beneficiary  rights in any
employee  or  former  employee  of  the  Company  or  any  Company  Subsidiaries
(including  any  beneficiary  or  dependent  thereof)  in respect  of  continued
employment  by the Company or any Company  Subsidiaries  or  otherwise.  Nothing
herein  shall (i)  guarantee  employment  for any period of time or preclude the
ability of Parent or the Surviving  Corporation or its subsidiaries to terminate
any employee of the Company for any reason, (ii) require Parent or the Surviving
Corporation  or any of their  respective  subsidiaries  to  continue  any Plans,
employee benefit plans or arrangements or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination  thereof  after the Closing Date or (iii) amend any Plans,  employee
benefit plans or arrangements.

      Section 6.07 HSR Act Filing.

            (a) Each of Parent  and the  Company  shall (i) use best  efforts to
make or cause to be made the filings required of such party to this Agreement or
any of its  subsidiaries  or  Affiliates  under the HSR Act with  respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement,  (ii) comply at the earliest  practicable  date with any
request  under  the HSR Act for  additional  information,  documents,  or  other
materials  received  by such  party or any of its  subsidiaries  from the United
States  Federal Trade  Commission or the United States  Department of Justice or
any  other   Governmental   Authority   in  respect  of  such  filings  or  such
transactions,  and (iii)  cooperate  in good faith with the other  party to this
Agreement in connection  with any such filing and in connection  with  resolving
any  investigation  or other  inquiry of any such  agency or other  Governmental
Authority  under any Antitrust  Laws with respect to any such filing or any such
transaction. The parties to this Agreement shall


                                       27
<PAGE>

consult in good faith with each other to  determine  whether  any other  filing,
application or notice must be made or approval must be obtained  pursuant to any
applicable  Law,  and  shall  use best  efforts  to  furnish  to each  other all
information  required for, any such filing,  application or notice to be made or
approval to be obtained  pursuant to any applicable  Law, in connection with the
Merger.  Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other parties to
this  Agreement  of any  communication  with,  and any  proposed  understanding,
undertaking,  or agreement with, any Governmental  Authority  regarding any such
filings or any such transaction.

            (b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to resolve  such  objections,  if any, as may be  asserted  by any  Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement under
the HSR Act,  the  Sherman  Act, as amended,  the Clayton  Act, as amended,  the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United States federal or
state or foreign statues, rules, regulations, orders, decrees, administrative or
judicial  doctrines  or other Laws that are  designed to  prohibit,  restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of  monopolization or restraint of
trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). Each of Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable  best  efforts to take such  action as may be  required  to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other  Antitrust Laws with
respect to such transactions as promptly as possible after the execution of this
Agreement.

            (c) For the avoidance of doubt,  Parent and its  subsidiaries  shall
commit  to any and  all  divestitures,  licenses  or hold  separate  or  similar
arrangements with respect to its assets or conduct of business arrangements as a
condition to obtaining any and all approvals from any Governmental Authority for
any reason in order to cause the expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR
Act or other Antitrust Laws and obtain any other required  consents or approvals
of any Governmental Authority, as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than the  Expiration  Date,  including  taking any and all actions  necessary in
order to ensure that (x) no requirement  for  non-action,  a waiver,  consent or
approval of the United States Federal Trade Commission,  the Antitrust  Division
of the United States Department of Justice,  any State Attorney General or other
Governmental  Authority,   (y)  no  decree,  judgment,   injunction,   temporary
restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no other
matter  relating  to any  antitrust  or  competition  Law or  regulation,  would
preclude  satisfaction  of the conditions to the Merger set forth in ARTICLE VII
by the Expiration Date; provided,  however, and notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  contained in this  Agreement,  the  provisions of this Section 6.07 or
Section 6.09 shall not be construed to require  Parent to undertake or commit to
undertake any efforts or to take any action or commit to take any action if such
efforts  or  action  would,  or would  reasonably  be  expected  to  result in a
Substantial Detriment.  "Substantial  Detriment" (i) a substantial impairment of
the  benefits  to  Parent  reasonably  expected,  as of the date  hereof,  to be
realized from consummation of the Merger or (ii) any event,  development,  state
of facts,  occurrence  or change that is or would  reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate,  materially  adverse to the business,  assets,
condition  (financial or  otherwise)  or results of  operations  of Parent,  the
Company and their respective  subsidiaries,  taken as a whole; provided that any
requirement  to divest,  license or hold separate or similar  arrangements  with
respect to the assets or conduct of  business  arrangements  of Parent  shall be
deemed to result in a  Substantial  Detriment  if such action with  respect to a
comparable  amount of assets or businesses  of the Company and its  Subsidiaries
would be reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect,  at or after the Effective  Time. The Company shall agree if, but solely
if, requested by Parent, to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to
take any action  with  respect  to the  businesses,  services,  or assets of the
Company  or any  of its  subsidiaries  in  furtherance  of  this  Section  6.07;
provided,  however, that any such action may be conditioned upon consummation of
the Merger.

      Section 6.08  Notification of Certain Matters.  Subject to applicable Laws
and the  instructions  of any  Governmental  Authority,  each of the Company and
Parent  shall  keep the other  reasonably  apprised  of the  status  of  matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, including


                                       28
<PAGE>

promptly  furnishing  the other with  copies of notices or other  communications
received  by Parent or the  Company,  as the case may be, or any of the  Company
Subsidiaries,  from any third  Person  and/or any  Governmental  Authority  with
respect to the  Merger.  Between  the date hereof and the  Effective  Time,  the
Company shall give prompt notice to Parent,  and Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company,  if the  occurrence  or  non-occurrence  of any event,  which is
likely  to result in the  failure  of a  condition  set  forth in  ARTICLE  VII;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.08
shall not  limit or  otherwise  affect  the  remedies  or  conditions  available
hereunder to any of the parties receiving such notice.

      Section 6.09 Further Action;  Reasonable Best Efforts.  Upon the terms and
subject to the  conditions of this  Agreement,  each of the Company,  Parent and
Merger Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to effect the  consummation
of the Merger as soon as reasonably  practicable after the date hereof.  Without
limiting the foregoing, (a) each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
to comply promptly with all legal  requirements  (and to cause any injunction or
order issued by a  Governmental  Authority to be removed) that may be imposed on
itself with respect to the Merger and shall promptly  cooperate with and furnish
information to each other in connection with any such requirements  imposed upon
any of them or any of their  subsidiaries in connection with the Merger, and (b)
the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use its or their
reasonable best efforts to provide notice or obtain any consent,  authorization,
order or approval of, or any exemption by, any  Governmental  Authority or other
public or private third Person required to be obtained or made by the Company or
any of the Company  Subsidiaries  in connection with the Merger or the taking of
any  action  contemplated  thereby  or by this  Agreement  (including  obtaining
consents  identified  by Parent or the Company  prior to the  Closing  under any
Contracts of the Company or any Company Subsidiary).

      Section 6.10 Public  Announcements.  The initial press releases  issued by
each party announcing the Merger shall be in a form that is mutually  acceptable
to Parent and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall consult with
each another before  issuing any press  releases or otherwise  making any public
announcements  with respect to the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,
and except as may be required by applicable Laws or by the rules and regulations
of the New York Stock  Exchange  shall not issue any such press  release or make
any such  announcement  prior to such consultation (it being understood that the
final form and  content  of any such  release  or  announcement,  as well as the
timing of any such release or announcement,  shall be at the final discretion of
the disclosing party).

      Section  6.11  Solvency  Opinion.  In the event  that  Parent  receives  a
solvency opinion in connection with its procurement of financing for the Merger,
Parent agrees to cause to be delivered to the Company a letter  confirming  that
the  Company  Board may rely on any such  opinion  from an  appraisal  firm that
addresses  whether,  following  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby, the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries would be solvent and that such
transactions would not otherwise "impair the capital of the corporation"  within
the meaning of Section 160(a) of the DGCL.

      Section 6.12  Obligations of Merger Sub.  Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts  to cause  Merger Sub and the  Surviving  Corporation  to perform  their
respective  obligations  under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

      Section 6.13 Rule 16b-3.  The Company shall take  commercially  reasonably
steps to cause the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement and any other
dispositions  of  equity  securities  of the  Company  in  connection  with  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is


                                       29
<PAGE>

a director or  executive  officer of the  Company to be exempt  under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

      Section 6.14 Financing.

            (a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the Company and
its Affiliates have no responsibility for any financing that Parent or Merger
Sub may raise in connection with the Merger. Any offering materials and other
related documents prepared by or on behalf of or utilized by Parent or its
Affiliates and financing sources, in connection with Parent and Merger Sub's
financing activities in connection with the Merger, that include any information
provided by the Company or any of its Affiliates, including any offering
memorandum, banker's book or similar document used, or any other written
offering materials used (collectively, "Offering Materials"), in connection with
any debt or securities offering or other such Parent and Merger Sub financing
shall include a conspicuous disclaimer to the effect that neither the Company
nor any of its Affiliates has any responsibility for the content of such
document and disclaims all responsibility therefor and shall further include a
disclaimer with respect to the Company and its Affiliates in any oral disclosure
with respect to such financing.

            (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their respective best efforts to
take,  or cause to be taken,  all  actions  and to do, or cause to be done,  all
things  necessary,  proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the  Financing
and the Financing  Commitments,  (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements
with respect to the Financing and Financing Commitments, so that such agreements
are in effect as  promptly  as  practicable  but in any event no later  than the
Effective  Time and (iii)  consummate the Financing at or prior to the Effective
Time.  Parent and Merger Sub shall  provide to the  Company  copies of all final
documents relating to the Financing and shall keep the Company fully informed of
material  developments  in respect of the financing  process  relating  thereto.
Prior to the Closing,  Parent and Merger Sub shall not agree to, or permit,  any
amendment or  modification  of, or waiver under,  the Financing  Commitments  or
other final  documentation  relating to the Financing (i) in a manner that would
(A) reduce the aggregate  amount of available  Financing or (B) delay or prevent
the Closing or (ii) which is  otherwise  adverse to the Company in any  material
respect,  without the prior written  consent of the Company (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld). In the period between the date hereof and the Closing
Date,  upon request of Parent and Merger Sub, the Company  shall,  and shall use
reasonable  best  efforts to cause the Company  Subsidiaries,  and its and their
Affiliates and Representatives  to, reasonably  cooperate with Parent and Merger
Sub in connection with the Financing,  including without limitation,  subject to
Section 6.14(a),  (i) preparation of any required financial  statements relating
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and any required pro forma financial
information;  (ii) reasonable  participation in meetings and road shows, if any;
(iii)  the  provision  of  information  relating  to  the  Financing  reasonably
requested  by Parent and  Merger  Sub;  and (iv)  reasonable  assistance  in the
preparation of offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and
similar documents of Parent. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly,  upon request
by the  Company,  reimburse  the  Company  for  all  reasonable  and  documented
out-of-pocket   expenses   incurred  by  the  Company  or  its   Affiliates   or
Representatives in connection with such cooperation. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to execute and
deliver any commitment letters, underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and
security documents,  or other definitive  financing documents in connection with
the Financing prior to the Closing.

            (c) If, notwithstanding the use of best efforts by Parent and Merger
Sub to satisfy its obligations  under Section  6.14(b),  any of the Financing or
the  Financing  Commitments  (or any  definitive  financing  agreement  relating
thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for
any reason,  Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such
expiration or termination and the reasons therefor and (ii) promptly arrange for
alternative  financing  (which shall be in an amount  sufficient  to pay for the
consummation of the Merger from other sources and which do not


                                       30
<PAGE>

include any conditions of such alternative  financing that are more onerous than
or in  addition to the  conditions  set forth in the  Financing)  to replace the
financing contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments or agreements.

      Section 6.15  Shareholder  Litigation.  To the extent not violative of any
fiduciary duties owed by the Company to its shareholders, and to the extent that
such  action  shall not  operate as a waiver of the  Company's  work  product or
attorney  client or other  privileges,  (a) the Company  shall  promptly  advise
Parent orally or in writing of any  stockholder  litigation  against the Company
and/or  its  directors  relating  to  this  Agreement,  the  Merger  and/or  the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  and shall keep  Parent  informed
regarding any such stockholder litigation, (b) the Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to  participate in the defense or settlement of any such  litigation
and (c) the Company shall not settle any such litigation  without Parent's prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

      Section  6.16   Resignations.   The  Company   shall   furnish  to  Parent
resignations  in writing  (effective  as of the  Closing  Date) from such of the
officers and directors of the Company as Parent may have requested not less than
10 days prior to the Closing Date.

                                  ARTICLE VII

warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement  shall be true and correct
in all  respects,  without  regard to any  "materiality"  or  "Company  Material
Adverse Effect"  qualifications  contained in them, as of the Effective Time, as
though  made on and as of such date and time  (except  for  representations  and
warranties expressly made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which shall be
determined  as of that  specified  date),  unless the failure or failures of any
such  representations  and  warranties to be so true and correct in all respects
would not,  individually or in the aggregate,  have a Company  Material  Adverse
Effect.

            (b) Agreements  and  Covenants.  The Company shall have performed or

and as of  such  date  and  time  (except  for  representations  and  warranties
expressly made as of a specified date, the accuracy of which shall be determined
as of  that  specified  date),  unless  the  failure  or  failures  of any  such
representations  and  warranties to be so true and correct in all respects would
not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent the consummation of the Merger or
prevent  Parent  or  Merger  Sub from  performing  its  obligations  under  this
Agreement.

            (b) Agreements  and  Covenants.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
have  performed or complied in all material  respects  with all  agreements  and
covenants  required by this  Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on
or prior to the Effective Time.

            (c)  Officer's  Certificate.   Parent  and  Merger  Sub  shall  have

                                   TERMINATION

      Section 8.01 Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be  abandoned  at any time prior to the  Effective  Time by action  taken or
authorized  by the  board of  directors  of the  terminating  party or  parties,
notwithstanding  any requisite adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of
the Company,  and whether before or after the  stockholders  of the Company have
approved  this  Agreement  at the  Company  Stockholders'  Meeting  (other  than
termination by the Company pursuant to Section  8.01(h),  which such termination
may  only  be  effected  prior  to  obtaining  the  Stockholder  Approval,  or a
termination  by the Company or Parent  pursuant to Section  8.01(f),  which such
termination may, for the avoidance of doubt,  only be effected after the Company
Stockholders'  Meeting),  as  follows  (the  date of any such  termination,  the
"Termination Date"):

            (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

            (b) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective  Time shall not
have  occurred on or before March 31, 2008 (the  "Expiration  Date");  provided,
however,  that the Expiration Date shall be  automatically  extended until April
30, 2008 in the event the Proxy Statement has not been cleared by the


                                       32
<PAGE>

SEC on or prior to the date that is five  business  days prior to  February  29,
2008; further provided, that the Expiration Date shall be automatically extended
until  April 30,  2008 in the event  that,  as of March  31,  2008,  each of the
conditions  set forth in ARTICLE  VII have been  satisfied  or waived as of such
date,  other than the conditions set forth in Section  7.01(b) and those that by
their nature are only satisfied as of the Closing;  and further  provided,  that
the right to terminate  this Agreement  under this Section  8.01(b) shall not be
available  to the party  whose  failure to  fulfill  any  obligation  under this
Agreement  has been the cause of, or resulted  in, the failure of the  Effective
Time to occur on or before such date;

            (c) by either  Parent or the Company if any  Governmental  Authority
shall have enacted,  issued,  promulgated,  enforced or entered any  injunction,
order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have
taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final and non-appealable
and has the effect of making  consummation  of the Merger  illegal or  otherwise
preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger;

            (d) by Parent if (i) any of the  representations  and  warranties of
the Company herein are or become untrue or inaccurate  such that Section 7.02(a)
would  not be  satisfied,  or (ii)  there  has been a breach  on the part of the
Company of any of its covenants or agreements  herein such that Section  7.02(b)
would not be satisfied,  and, in either such case,  such breach has not been, or
cannot be, cured within 60 days after  receipt of written  notice by the Company
from Parent; provided,  however, in the event that on or after the date which is
45  days  after  receipt  of  such  written  notice  by the  Company,  it is not
reasonably likely that such breach can be cured within such 60-day period,  such
60-day  period may be reduced to 45 days (or such number of days greater than 45
days but less than 60 days as shall be specified  by Parent) by further  written
notice by Parent to the Company;

            (e) by the Company if (i) any of the  representations and warranties
of either Parent or Merger Sub herein are or become  untrue or  inaccurate  such
that Section 7.03(a) would not be satisfied,  or (ii) there has been a breach on
the part of either  Parent or Merger Sub of any of its  covenants or  agreements
herein such that Section  7.03(b)  would not be  satisfied,  and, in either such
case, such breach has not been, or cannot be, cured within 60 days after receipt
of written  notice by Parent and Merger Sub, as  applicable,  from the  Company;
provided, however, in the event that on or after the date which is 45 days after
receipt of such written  notice by Parent and Merger Sub, as  applicable,  it is
not  reasonably  likely that such breach can be cured within such 60-day period,
such  60-day  period may be reduced to 45 days (or such  number of days  greater
than 45 days but less  than 60 days as shall be  specified  by the  Company)  by
further written notice by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable;

            (f) by either  Parent or the  Company  if the  Stockholder  Approval
shall  not have  been  obtained  at the  Company  Stockholders'  Meeting  or any
adjournment or postponement thereof at which adoption of this Agreement is voted
upon;

            (g) by Parent if the Company  Board shall have (i) effected a Change
in Board  Recommendation,  (ii) taken any of the actions  prohibited  by Section
6.04(c), or (iii) taken a position or published, sent or given to stockholders a
statement  contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to any
tender or exchange offer by a third party other than  recommending  rejection of
such  tender or  exchange  offer  within 10  Business  Days after such tender or
exchange offer is made; or

            (h) by the Company  pursuant to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 6.04(d).

      Section 8.02 Effect of  Termination.  In the event of the  termination  of
this Agreement  pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith  become
void,  and there shall be no liability  under this  Agreement on the part of any
party hereto (except that the provisions of Section 6.03(c), this Section


                                       33
<PAGE>

8.02, Section 8.03 and ARTICLE IX shall survive any such termination); provided,
however,  that nothing  herein shall  relieve any party from  liability  for any
intentional  breach  of any of its  representations,  warranties,  covenants  or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination.

      Section 8.03 Fees and Expenses; Termination Fees.

            (a) All Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be
paid  by the  party  incurring  such  expenses,  whether  or not the  Merger  is
consummated. "Expenses", as used in this Agreement, shall include all reasonable
out-of-pocket  documented  expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants,  investment  bankers,  financing sources,  hedging  counterparties,
experts and  consultants  to a party  hereto and its  Affiliates)  incurred by a
party  or on its  behalf  in  connection  with or  related  to the  transactions
contemplated  hereby,  including the  authorization,  preparation,  negotiation,
execution and performance of this Agreement, the preparation,  printing,  filing
and mailing of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation of stockholder approval and
all other matters related to the closing of the Merger.

            (b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement shall be terminated:

                  (i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(f),  and at or prior to
      the  Termination  Date,  a Person or group shall have made an  Acquisition
      Proposal  to  the  Company  or  the  stockholders  of  the  Company  or an
      Acquisition  Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly  announced and,
      no later than 12 months after the applicable Termination Date, the Company
      enters into an agreement with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal,  or the
      Acquisition   Proposal  (which,  in  each  case,  need  not  be  the  same
      Acquisition  Proposal  as the  Acquisition  Proposal  described  above) is
      consummated,  then the Company  will pay to Parent,  on the earlier of (x)
      the date  that a  definitive  agreement  in  respect  of such  Acquisition
      Proposal  is  executed  and  (y)  the  date  of  the  consummation  of the
      transaction  in  respect  of  such  Acquisition   Proposal,   the  Company
      Termination Fee in immediately  available  funds, as directed by Parent in
      writing;  provided,  that for the purpose of this Section 8.03(b)(i),  all
      references  to "20%" or "25%" in the  definition of  Acquisition  Proposal
      shall be changed to "45%";

                  (ii) by Parent or the Company  pursuant to Section  8.01(g)(i)
      or 8.01(g)(iii),  then the Company shall pay to Parent, on the Termination
      Date, the Company Termination Fee in immediately available funds; or

                  (iii) by the  Company  pursuant to Section  8.01(h),  then the
      Company  shall  pay  to  Parent,  on the  Termination  Date,  the  Company
      Termination Fee, in immediately  available funds, as directed by Parent in
      writing.

            (c) For purposes of this Agreement,  "Company Termination Fee" means
an amount in cash equal to 3% of the aggregate Merger Consideration. The Company
and Parent acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an
integral part of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.  In the event
that the Company  shall fail to pay the Company  Termination  Fee when due,  the
Company shall reimburse  Parent for all reasonable  costs and expenses  actually
incurred  or accrued  (including  reasonable  fees and  expenses  of counsel) in
connection  with the collection  under and the enforcement of this Section 8.03,
together with interest from the  Termination  Date on all amounts so owed at the
prime rate  announced  by  JPMorgan  Chase Bank as its prime rate in effect from
time to time during such period. The parties hereto agree and understand that in
no event shall the Company be  required  to pay the Company  Termination  Fee on
more than one occasion.

            (d) The Company shall reimburse  Parent and Merger Sub for all their
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection

shall reimburse the Company for all its reasonable and documented  out-of-pocket
expenses actually incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the
other  transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement  if  this  Agreement  is
terminated  pursuant to Section 8.01(e).  Any such  reimbursement  shall be paid
upon such termination, except that no payment shall be due Parent and Merger Sub
for  reimbursement  of such  expenses  if the Company  has  previously  paid the
Company  Termination  Fee.  Subject to Section  9.10(a),  the provisions of this
Section  8.03(d) shall be in addition to and shall not limit any other liability
for losses or damages which the parties may otherwise have.

<PAGE>

substance of the transactions  contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially  adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other

shall  negotiate  in good  faith to modify  this  Agreement  so as to effect the

originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

matter  hereof  and  thereof.  This  Agreement  shall not be  assigned  (whether
pursuant to a merger,  by operation of law or otherwise),  except that Parent or

the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby or, after the Closing,
in connection with a merger,  consolidation or sale of all or substantially  all
of the  assets of  Parent or the  Surviving  Corporation  and its  subsidiaries;
provided,  however, that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of
its obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party  hereto,  and nothing in this

Person any right,  benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement,  other than,  subject to the limitations set forth in Section

covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons).

      Section  9.09  Governing  Law.  This  Agreement  shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware  (without giving
effect to the choice of law principles therein).

      Section 9.10 Sole and Exclusive Remedy;  Specific Performance;  Submission
to Jurisdiction; No Recourse.

both of them has  incurred  any  losses  or  damages  in  connection  with  this

Parent and Merger Sub shall be limited in the aggregate and without  duplication
to either (but not both) (i) 3% of the aggregate  Merger  Consideration  or (ii)
the payment of the Company  Termination  Fee  pursuant  to Section  8.03(b),  if

            (b) The  parties to this  Agreement  agree that  irreparable  damage
would occur in the event that any of the  provisions  of this  Agreement are not
performed  by the  parties  in  accordance  with  their  specific  terms  or are
otherwise  breached.  It is accordingly  agreed that the parties hereto shall be
entitled  to seek an  injunction  or  injunctions  to prevent  breaches  of this
Agreement and to specifically  enforce the terms hereof,  this being in addition
to any other  remedy to which they are  entitled at Law or in equity.  Except as
provided  in  Section  9.10(a)  or as  otherwise  provided  herein,  any and all
remedies herein expressly  conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon
such party,  and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

            (c) Each of the parties  hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the
personal  jurisdiction  of the Court of Chancery or other courts of the State of

attempt to deny or defeat such personal  jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave  from  such  court,  (iii)  agrees  that it will not bring any  action
relating  to this  Agreement  or any of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  in any court other than the Court of Chancery or other  courts of the

service being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.02. Each
party hereto hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, service

causes  of  action  that may be  based  upon,  arise  out of or  relate  to this
Agreement,  or the  negotiation,  execution or performance of this Agreement may
only be made  against the  entities  that are  expressly  identified  as parties
hereto and no past, present or future Affiliate,  director,  officer,  employee,
incorporator,   member,  manager,  partner,  stockholder,   agent,  attorney  or
representative  of any party hereto shall have any liability for any obligations
or  liabilities  of the parties to this  Agreement or for any claim based on, in

WAIVES TO THE FULLEST  EXTENT  PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING

PARTIES  HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO  REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY
OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,  SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT FOREGOING  WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT IT AND THE OTHER  PARTIES  HERETO HAVE BEEN  INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE MERGER, AS APPLICABLE,  BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,  THE
