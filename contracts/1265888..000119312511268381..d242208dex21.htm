Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any holder of any shares of Common Stock (the " _Shares_ ") or any
shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
the right to receive the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, in cash,
without interest, together with any amounts that may become payable in respect
of such Share in the future from the Escrow Funds as provided in this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or in respect of the Adjustment Amount, at
the respective times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and
therein;

(b) Each Share that is owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and each Share that is held in the treasury of the Company or
owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease

15 (c) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding

prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor
of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded

") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive a
portion of the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder fails to
perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails
to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such Dissenting
Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
3.1, without interest. The Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of
any written demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted
written withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders
rights to appraisal with respect to the Merger. Parent and the Company shall
jointly participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
exercise of such appraisal rights under the DGCL. Neither Parent nor the

(a) At the Effective Time, without any action on the part of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, or the holders of the Options, each unvested Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into an option to acquire a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest number of whole
shares) of (i) the number of Shares subject to the Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the exercise
price per Share of such Option immediately prior to the Effective Time,
_divided_ by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; provided, however, that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable
pursuant to the Options (as converted) shall be subject to such adjustments as
determined by Parent are necessary for the foregoing conversion to satisfy the
requirements of Sections 409A, 422 and 424 of the Code and Treasury
Regulation Section 1.4241 and to avoid coverage of the Options by Section
409A of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each such Option shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as set forth in the applicable Option Plan and any
agreements thereunder as were applicable immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

 



16 (b) At the Effective Time, each vested Option that is outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Cancelled
Option_ ") shall be cancelled in exchange for (i) a payment to the holder of
such Option of an amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Shares that
were subject to such Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(B) the amount by which the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the
per share exercise price of such Option and (ii) any amounts that may become
payable in respect of such Option in the future from the Escrow Funds as
provided in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement or in respect of the
Adjustment Amount, at the respective times and subject to the contingencies
specified herein and therein. As promptly as practicable (and in any event
within five Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall make the payments described in the foregoing clause (i) utilizing the
Companys payroll system or other means reasonably determined by the
Surviving Corporation. After the Effective Time, each Cancelled Option shall
no longer be exercisable by the holder thereof for, or otherwise entitle the
holder thereof to receive, Shares (or any other equity security), but shall
only entitle such holder to the payments described in this paragraph (b).
Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), at all times from
and after the Effective Time, maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy
their obligations to the holder of Cancelled Options. The payments made as
described in this paragraph (b) shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Cancelled Options.

 

(c) In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall assume the Option Plan and the
AMACAI Option Plan, and the number and kind of shares available for issuance
under each of the Option Plan and the AMACAI Option Plan shall be converted
into Parent Common Stock in accordance with the respective provisions of the
Option Plan and the AMACAI Option Plan. Promptly (and in any event within ten
Business Days) after the Closing Date, Parent shall register the Option Plan
and the AMACAI Option Plan on one or more Form S-8 registration statements and
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statements as long as any
awards remain outstanding thereunder.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to effect the measures contemplated by this Section, including
adoption of any resolutions, interpretations, and plan amendments within a
reasonable period of time prior to the Effective Date, so that no holder of an
Option has any further rights with respect thereto (other than the rights
provided for in this Section).

(e) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver
written notice to each holder of an Option informing such holder of the effect
of the Merger on such Option.

 

SECTION 3.4 _Exchange and Payment_.

(a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of the
Stockholders, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the Closing Merger
Consideration due to the Stockholders (such cash, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments
due pursuant to this Article. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included
in the Payment Fund as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest or
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon
demand.

 



17 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate (the "
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
in exchange for the Merger Consideration. At its option, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, provide to any holder of Shares (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Paying Agent (which such
surrender may occur at the Closing), together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration for each Share
formerly represented by such Certificate (subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. Each such holder shall also be entitled to any amounts that may
be payable in the future in respect of the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificate from the Escrow Funds as provided in this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement and on account of the Adjustment Amount, at the respective
times and subject to the contingencies specified herein and therein. No
interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates on
the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) If payment in respect of any Certificate is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name such Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the
signatures on such Certificate or any related stock power shall be
properly guaranteed and that the Person requesting such payment shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent and the Paying Agent that any
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not
applicable. Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, any Certificate (other than Certificates representing Cancelled
Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive the portion of the Merger
Consideration payable with respect thereto, in cash, without interest, as
contemplated herein.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of any shares
of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, a Certificate (other than one representing Cancelled Shares)
is presented to the Surviving Corporation, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this Section.

(e) All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms
of this Article and all cash deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Article shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to Shares
represented thereby, except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable Law.

 



18 (f) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Surviving
Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the relevant portion of the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Section for the Shares represented
thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent may, in their reasonable discretion, require the delivery of a
satisfactory indemnity (or, if indemnification would not be reasonably
adequate, require delivery of a bond in such sum as the Surviving Corporation
or Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity).

(g) At any time following the date that is six months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest or other income received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and any Certificates or other
documents relating to the Merger in its possession, and thereafter the
holders of Certificates shall be entitled to look to Parent with respect to
any portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their
Certificates, without interest; _provided_ that any such portion of the Merger
Consideration payable from the Escrow Funds shall be held and distributed to
the Persons entitled thereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement, at the respective times and subject to the
contingencies specified herein and therein and any portion of the Adjustment
Amount to which the Stockholders may become entitled shall become payable at
the times and subject to the contingencies specified herein. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, none of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been exchanged
prior to four years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such
earlier date on which the related Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

SECTION 3.5 _Escrow Funds_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or
cause to be deposited with the Escrow Agent:

(a) the Indemnification Escrow Amount (such amount, including any interest or
other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ ");

(b) the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount (such amount, including any
interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund_ "); and

(c) the Stockholder Representative Escrow Amount (such amount, including any
interest or other amounts earned thereon and less any disbursements therefrom
in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, the " _Stockholder Representative
Escrow Fund_ " and, together with the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Purchase
Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, the " _Escrow Funds_ ").

 



19 SECTION 3.6 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that such amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in
respect to which such deduction and withholding was made.

SECTION 3.7 _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the written consent of
the Consenting Stockholders, each Stockholder and each holder of Cancelled
Options shall be deemed to have consented to the appointment of Michael M.
Sullivan as such Persons representative and attorney-in-fact (the "
_Stockholder Representative_ "), with full power of substitution to act on
behalf of the Stockholders and such Cancelled Option holders to the extent and
in the manner set forth in this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. All
decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Stockholder
Representative with respect to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including all decisions,
actions, consents and instructions relating to the defense or settlement of
any claims for indemnification, shall be binding upon all Stockholders and
all such Cancelled Option holders, and no Stockholder nor any such Cancelled
Option holder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or
otherwise contest any such decision, action, consent or instruction. Parent
and Merger Sub shall be entitled to rely on any decision, action, consent or
instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, action,
consent or instruction of the Stockholders and the Cancelled Option holders,
and Parent and Merger Sub are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person
for acts done by them in accordance with any such decision, act, consent or
instruction. The provisions of this Section, including the power of attorney
granted hereby, are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled
with an interest and shall not be terminated by any act of any one or more
Stockholders or any one or more of the Cancelled Option holders, or by
operation of Law, whether by death or other event.

(b) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Stockholders
and holders of Cancelled Options holding Shares (including Shares that, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were issuable upon the exercise of
Cancelled Options) equal to or greater than a majority of the aggregate Fully
Diluted Share Number as of the Effective Time (the " _Majority Holders_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall the Stockholder Representative
resign or be removed without the Majority Holders having first appointed a
new Stockholder Representative who shall assume such duties immediately upon
the resignation or removal of the Stockholder Representative. In the event of
the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of the Stockholder
Representative, a new Stockholder Representative shall be appointed by the
vote or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of such vote or a copy
of the written consent appointing 

 



20  such new Stockholder Representative shall be sent to Parent, such
appointment to be effective upon the later of the date indicated in such
consent or the date such notice is received by Parent;  _provided_ , that
until such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely on the decisions, actions, consents and
instructions of the prior Stockholder Representative as described in
paragraph (a) above. The Stockholder Representative may charge a reasonable
fee for its services; _provided_ , that all fees and expenses incurred by the
Stockholder Representative in performing its duties hereunder (including legal
fees and expenses related thereto) and any indemnification in favor of the
Stockholder Representative shall be borne solely by the Stockholders and the
holders of Cancelled Options. The Stockholder Representative shall seek to
recover all such amounts first from the Stockholder Representative Escrow
Fund before pursuing recovery directly against the Stockholders or the
Cancelled Option holders.

(c) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to the Stockholders or
the Cancelled Option holders for actions taken pursuant to this Agreement or
the Escrow Agreement, except to the extent such actions shall have been
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have constituted gross
negligence or involved fraud, bad faith or intentional misconduct or
concealment. Except in cases where a court of competent jurisdiction has made
such a finding, the Stockholders and the Cancelled Option holders shall
jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements, arising out of and in connection with its activities as
Stockholder Representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

 

(d) The approval of this Agreement by the written consent of the Consenting
Stockholders shall also be deemed to constitute approval of all arrangements
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the provisions hereof
binding upon the Stockholders and the Cancelled Option holders, including the
indemnification provisions hereof.

 

SECTION 3.8 _Purchase Price Adjustment._

(a) Within 30 days after the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare and deliver to
the Stockholder Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ")
setting forth in reasonable detail Parents calculation of Closing Cash,
Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, the deviation of Closing Cash from Estimated
Closing Cash, the deviation of Closing Non-Cash Working Capital from Estimated
Closing Non-Cash Working Capital and the Adjustment Amount.

(b) On the 30th day following the delivery of the Closing Statement to the
Stockholder Representative, the Closing Statement shall become final and
binding on all parties hereto and all Stockholders unless, on or prior to such
30th day, the Stockholder Representative shall have delivered to Parent a
statement describing in reasonable detail the nature, amount and basis of
each objection of the Stockholder Representative to the Closing Statement.
During such 30-day period, the Stockholder Representative and its advisors
(including its accountants) shall be permitted to review the working papers
of Parent and its advisors (including its accountants) relating to the
Closing Statement, and such 30-day period shall be extended by one day for
each day such working papers are not made available to the Stockholder
Representative.

 



21 (c) If the Stockholder Representative timely objects to the Closing Statement,
such objections shall be resolved as set forth below. In connection
therewith, Parent and its advisors (including its accountants) shall be
permitted to review the working papers of the Stockholder Representative and
its advisors (including its accountants) relating to such objections.

(i) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall first use
their reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections in good faith.

(ii) If Parent and the Stockholder Representative are able to resolve such
objections within 30 days after delivery of such statement of objections,
Parent and the Stockholder Representative, within such 30-day period, shall
jointly prepare and sign a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, the deviation
of Closing Cash from Estimated Closing Cash, the deviation of Closing Non-Cash
Working Capital from Estimated Closing Non-Cash Working Capital and
the Adjustment Amount, which calculation shall reflect the resolution of
objections agreed to by Parent and the Stockholder Representative and which
shall be final and binding on all parties hereto and all Stockholders.

 

(iii) If Parent and the Stockholder Representative do not reach a resolution
of all objections set forth in such statement of objections within 30 days
after delivery of such statement of objections, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall, within 15 days after the expiration of such 30-day
period, (A) jointly prepare and sign a statement setting forth (1) those
objections (if any) that Parent and the Stockholder Representative have
resolved and the resolution of such objections, which resolutions shall be
final and binding on all parties hereto and all Stockholders, and (2)
those objections which remain unresolved (the " _Unresolved Objections_ "),
and (B) engage the Neutral Accountant to resolve the Unresolved Objections.

 

(iv) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall jointly submit to the
Neutral Accountant, within 5 days after the date of the engagement of the
Neutral Accountant (as evidenced by the date of the engagement agreement), a
copy of the Closing Statement, a copy of the statement of objections delivered
by the Stockholder Representative to Parent, and the joint statement referred
to in paragraph (iii) above. Each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative
shall submit to the Neutral Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other on
the same day), within 15 days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral
Accountant, a memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth
their respective positions on the Unresolved Objections. Each of Parent and
the Stockholder Representative may (but shall not be required to) submit to
the Neutral Accountant (with a copy delivered to the other on the same day),
within 30 days after the date of the engagement of the Neutral Accountant, a
memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the Neutral
Accountant by the other. Unless requested by the Neutral Accountant in
writing, neither Parent nor the Stockholder Representative may present any
additional information or arguments to the Neutral Accountant, either orally
or in writing.

 



22 (v) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall instruct the
Neutral Accountant that (A) the scope of its review and authority shall be
limited to resolving the Unresolved Objections and (B) the Neutral Accountant
shall issue a ruling, which sets forth the resolution of each Unresolved
Objection and includes a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the
calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, the deviation
of Closing Cash from Estimated Closing Cash, the deviation of Closing Non-Cash
Working Capital from Estimated Closing Non-Cash Working Capital, and the
Adjustment Amount, each reflecting the Neutral Accountants resolution of the
Unresolved Objections. The resolution of each Unresolved Objection shall
consist of the determination of an appropriate value for each Closing
Statement item that is the subject of an Unresolved Objection, which value
shall be equal to one of, or between, the values proposed by the Stockholder
Representative and by Parent.

 

(vi) The resolution by the Neutral Accountant of the Unresolved Objections
shall be final and binding upon all parties hereto and all Stockholders.
Parent and the Stockholder Representative agree that the procedure set forth
in this Section for resolving disputes with respect to the Closing Statement
shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such disputes;
_provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit Parent or the Stockholder
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce the ruling of the
Neutral Accountant in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance
with Section 11.9.

(vii) The fees, costs and expenses of the Neutral Accountant under this
Section shall be paid by Parent and the Stockholders in relation to the
proportional difference between the Neutral Accountants final determination
of the Adjustment Amount and the Stockholder Representatives and Parents
determinations of the Adjustment Amount, as reflected in the Closing
Statement or in the Stockholder Representatives statement of objections, as
applicable ( _provided_ , that the payment obligations of the Stockholders
shall be satisfied exclusively by a disbursement from the Stockholder
Representative Escrow Fund and, solely to the extent the then remaining
balance of the Stockholder Representative Escrow Fund is insufficient to fully
satisfy such payment obligation, from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund and then, if the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund is exhausted, from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund).

 

(d) If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this Section,
is a negative number, the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall, within
three Business Days of such final determination, jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund by wire
transfer of immediately available funds (i) to Parent, the Adjustment
Amount, (ii) to the Paying Agent, for distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, the Stockholders aggregate Pro Rata
Shares of any remaining amount, if any, and (iii) to the Surviving
Corporation, for distribution to the holders of Cancelled Options in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, such holders aggregate Pro Rata Shares
of such remaining amount, if any. Parent and the Company agree that the
Purchase Price Escrow Fund shall not be the sole source of Parents right to
the Adjustment Amount, and that the Stockholders and the Cancelled Option
holders shall be severally, in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, and not
jointly, liable for any shortfall. Parent shall recover such shortfall from
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the extent of the amount then held in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, before seeking to recover directly from the
Stockholders or Cancelled Option holders.

 



23 (e) If the Adjustment Amount, as finally determined pursuant to this Section,
is a positive number, within three Business Days after the final
determination of the Adjustment Amount, (i) Parent shall (A) deposit with the
Paying Agent, for distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with their
Pro Rata Shares, the Stockholders aggregate Pro Rata Shares of the
Adjustment Amount, and (B) deposit with the Surviving Corporation, for
distribution to the holders of Cancelled Options in accordance with their Pro
Rata Shares, such holders aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Adjustment Amount,
and (ii) the Stockholder Representative and Parent shall jointly instruct the
Escrow Agent to disburse from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund by
wire transfer of immediately available funds (A) to the Paying Agent, for
distribution to the Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, the
Stockholders aggregate Pro Rata Shares of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Fund, and (B) to the Surviving Corporation, for distribution to the
holders of Cancelled Options in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, such
holders aggregate Pro Rata Shares of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Fund.

 

(f) Each of Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall assist, and shall
cause its Affiliates to assist, the other party and its advisors (including
its accountants) in the review of the Closing Statement and in connection with
the other matters addressed by this Section. Each of Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall afford to the other party and its
advisors (including its accountants), reasonable access, upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours, to the personnel, properties, books and
records of such first party and its Affiliates to the extent relevant to such
matters; _provided_ that such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of such first party or any of its Affiliates.

property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the closing of any
financing to be obtained by Parent or any of its Affiliates in order to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation. " _Solvent_ " means that, as of any date of
determination and with respect to any Person: (i) the fair value of the assets
of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, is greater than
the total amount of liabilities, including contingent liabilities, of such
Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, (ii) the present fair
saleable value of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, is not less than the amount that will be required to pay
the probable liability of such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated
basis, on their debts and liabilities as they become absolute and matured,
(iii) such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, are not
engaged in business or a transaction, and are not about to engage in business
or a transaction, for which such Persons and its Subsidiaries assets, on a
consolidated basis, would constitute unreasonably small capital, and (iv)
such Person and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, do not intend to,
and do not believe that they will, incur debts or liabilities beyond their
ability to pay such debts and liabilities as they mature; _provided_ , 
_however_ , the amount of any contingent liability at any time shall be
computed as the amount that, in light of all of the facts and circumstances
existing at such time, represents the amount that can reasonably be expected
to become an actual or matured liability (irrespective of whether such
contingent liabilities meet the criteria for accrual under Accounting
Standards Codification 450  Contingencies).

SECTION 5.9 _Information Statement._ No information included in the
Information Statement and provided by Parent in writing specifically for
inclusion in the Information Statement will, at the date the Information
Statement is delivered to the Stockholders or at the Record Date, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading.

 

SECTION 5.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that except for the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or in any schedule,

warranty concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries, the stockholders,
directors, officers or employees of the Company

 



48  and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets or properties or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that all projections, budgets,
forecasts and other forward looking information provided to Parent and Merger
Sub by or on behalf of the Company are not representations or warranties of
the Company or any of its Affiliates and are subject to uncertainties and
that actual results may be different from such projections, budgets, forecasts
and other forward looking information.

SECTION 5.11 _Brokers_. Except for Morgan Stanley and Allen and Company, the
fees of which will be paid by Parent, no broker, finder or investment banker
is entitled to any brokerage, finders or other fee or commission in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Agreements. Without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the
Company shall or shall cause the appropriate Affiliate thereof to (A)
promptly (and in any event no later than 10 Business Days after the date of

SECTION 6.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification existing in

of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Companys or its Subsidiaries
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable governing documents) as
in effect on the date of this Agreement or in any indemnification agreement
listed in Section _ 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule_ as in effect on the date
of this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
shall be assumed and performed by the Surviving Corporation and
shall continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
directors or officers arising out of such acts or omissions, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law. From the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or comparable governing documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries shall contain, and Parent shall cause the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable governing documents) of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to so contain, provisions (applicable to the
current and former directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time) no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation than are presently
set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable
governing documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 



56 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a
"tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy (the " _Tail
Policy_ ") for the Company and its Subsidiaries and their current and former
directors, officers and employees who are currently covered by the
directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained by
the Company in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent that shall provide such
directors, officers and employees with coverage for six years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms
not less favorable to the insured persons than the directors and officers
liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company. Following
the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain such policy in full force and
effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(c) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the successor and assign of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation assumes the obligations set forth in this
Section.

(d) The rights of the indemnified Persons under this Section shall be in
addition to (and not in limitation of) any rights such Persons may have under
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or comparable governing documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts
or Laws.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section shall survive consummation of the Merger
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her legal representatives.

SECTION 6.12 _Financing_. 

(a) Parent acknowledges that it shall be fully responsible for obtaining the
Financing and shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain the
Financing on the terms and subject only to the conditions described in the

in effect the Financing Commitment and negotiate definitive agreements with

ensure the accuracy of all representations and warranties of Parent set forth
in the Financing Commitment, (iii) comply with all covenants and agreements of
Parent set forth in Financing Commitment, (iv) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent in the Financing Commitment that are within
its control, and (v) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing (and,
in any event, assuming the satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.1 and 8.3 (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing), prior to the Outside Date). Parent shall
have the right from time to time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise
modify, or waive any of its rights under, the Financing Commitment, or
substitute other debt or raised equity financing for all or any portion of
the Financing from the same or alternative Financing

 



57  Sources; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not permit any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Financing Commitment, or
substituted debt or equity financing, if such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification or waiver or substituted debt or equity
financing would (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including
by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the
Financing) or (B) impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend,
modify or expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing from that set
forth in the Financing Commitment, in any such case of (A) or (B) above in a
manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) prevent, materially impede or
materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set forth in this Agreement, (y)
make the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Financing) less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact
the ability of Parent to enforce its rights under the Financing Commitment.
For purposes of this Section, references to "Financing" shall include the
financing contemplated by the Financing Commitment as permitted to be amended
or modified by this paragraph (a) and any substitute financing permitted by
this paragraph (a) and references to "Financing Commitment" or "Financing
Agreement" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended or modified
by this paragraph (a) and any comparable documents with respect to any
substitute financing permitted by this paragraph (a). The net cash proceeds of
any equity offering by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries after the date of
this Agreement shall constitute raised equity financing substituting for a
comparable portion of the debt financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitment for all purposes under this Agreement. The syndication of the
Financing to the extent permitted by the Financing Commitment shall not be
deemed to violate Parents obligations under this Agreement.

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated in the
Financing Commitment, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly
obtain alternative financing (and to obtain a new financing commitment letter
and a new definitive agreement related thereto) on terms not materially less
beneficial to Parent than the terms in the Financing Commitment in an amount,
together with all other cash and cash equivalents of Parent and Merger Sub on
the Closing Date, sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to otherwise consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the terms set forth in this Agreement (an "
_Alternative Financing_ "). To the extent not done on or prior to the date
hereof, Parent will furnish true and complete copies of any Financing
Commitment or Financing Agreement to the Company promptly upon their execution
(with only fee amounts and market flex provisions redacted (which in no event
shall modify or permit Parent or the lender party to modify the conditions
precedent to the Financing or otherwise reduce the amount or adversely affect
the availability of the Financing, in any such case, in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impede, or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms set forth in this Agreement; it being understood that
any reduction in the revolving commitment thereunder, which
revolving commitment is not necessary for, and which reduction will not
impair, prevent or delay, the consummation of the Merger, may be the subject
of redacted market flex provisions)).

consecutive Business Days after the date hereof throughout and at the end of
which (i) Parent and its Financing Sources shall have the Required
Information, (ii) no event has occurred and no condition exists that would
cause any of the conditions set forth in Section 8.3 to fail to be satisfied
if the Closing were to be held at any time during such 20 Business Day period

Closing), and (iii) the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 are satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing and other than the condition set forth in Section 8.1(a), which must

condition has not been satisfied by such time, the Marketing Period will be
extended until such time as such condition is satisfied)); _provided_ , that

the completion of the Marketing Period, the Companys accounting firm shall
have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any of the Companys audited
financial statements contained in the Required Information and (B) the
Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date on which the Financing is
consummated. If at any time the Company in good faith reasonably believes that
the Marketing Period has begun, it may deliver to Parent a written notice to
that effect, in which case the Marketing Period will be deemed to have begun
on the date of such notice, unless Parent in good faith reasonably believes
the Marketing Period has not begun and, within three Business Days after the
delivery of such notice, delivers a written notice to the Company to that
effect, stating with specificity why it believes the Marketing Period has not
begun. For purposes of establishing the commencement of the Marketing Period,
Parent hereby acknowledges receipt of all Required Information as of the date
of this Agreement, it being understood that the Company remains obligated to
update the Required Information to the extent provided in paragraph (e) below.

(vi) taking all corporate actions reasonably necessary to permit the
consummation of the Financing; _provided_ , that, the liabilities and

(e) The Company will (i) periodically update the Required Information
included in any offering document to be used in connection with such Financing
so that such Required Information remains in compliance with GAAP and does not
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein not
misleading and (ii) (A) within one Business Day of such becoming available,
and not later than 30 days following the end of a fiscal quarter, furnish

connection with the Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely in
a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



60 (f) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the

in a reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date
and material terms of the definitive documentation related to the Financing,
providing copies of then current drafts of the credit agreement and giving the
Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to the
Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company
promptly, and in any event within one Business Day, if at any time prior to

(i) the Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason (or if
any Person attempts or purports to terminate the Financing Commitment, whether

materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Financing;

(iv) a Financing Source refuses to provide or expresses to Parent in writing
an intent to refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment on the terms set forth therein; or

 

(v) Parent, for any reason, no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms described in
the Financing Commitment.

As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business
Days after the date the Company delivers to Parent a written request
therefor, Parent shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i) through (v) of
the immediately preceding sentence.

under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Effective Time and, other than as set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this
Section, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to

contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement that is
effective before the Effective Time) or that would be effective prior to the
Effective Time, (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to issue any offering or information document (other than customary
representation

 



61  letters in connection with bank information memoranda), (iii) Parent shall,

Section shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , that this clause (iv) shall not
prohibit the disclosure of such confidential information in connection with
the syndication of the Financing as contemplated by the Financing Commitment
to recipients subject to customary obligations of confidentiality and
restricted use), and (v) Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries approved by
the Company in writing specifically for use therein).

(h) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing
(including any Alternative Financing) is not a condition to the Closing.

to the Closing, the Company shall provide to Parent (a) a complete and correct
list of the obligees of all Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries,

Control Payment that is not payable at the Effective Time, at such later

after giving effect to the AMACAI Merger) and the number of Shares and
Options (and the exercise price thereof) held by each as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (in each case, after giving effect to the AMACAI

reasonably detailed calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration, the Fully
Diluted Share Number and the Closing Per Share Merger Consideration, and shall

Parent and Merger Sub shall not be responsible for the calculations or the
determinations regarding such calculations in such Closing Capitalization
Schedule.

(b) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall

SECTION 6.16 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The parties intend that there shall be continuity of employment with
respect to all Continuing Employees and that such Continuing Employees shall
remain employed by the Company or (or one of its Subsidiaries) as of and
following the Closing, as set forth herein.

(b) Through December 31, 2011, Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to provide each Continuing Employee with total cash compensation
(including base salary and bonus opportunity) and a bonus program (including
payout terms and timing of bonus

 



63  payments, which the parties hereto acknowledge may be made after December
31, 2011 in a manner consistent with the Companys past practice) that are the
same as such Continuing Employees total cash compensation and bonus program
immediately prior to the Closing. Through December 31, 2011, subject to
Section 6.16(f), Parent shall also cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
maintain the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing employee benefit plans
for the benefit of each Continuing Employee.

(c) From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, Parent shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to provide each Continuing Employee with total
cash compensation (including base salary and bonus opportunity) that is no
less favorable in the aggregate than such Continuing Employees total cash
compensation immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ that Parent may
instead provide or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide bonus
opportunities no less favorable than those provided to similarly-situated
employees of Parent and base salaries no less favorable than provided
immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
not be required to permit Company employees to draw any portion of
their respective anticipated 2012 bonuses in advance of the payment thereof.
From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, Parent shall also cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to maintain (i) the Companys and
its Subsidiaries dental and healthcare plans in effect as of immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) other employee benefit plans for the benefit of
each Continuing Employee (" _Post-Closing Plans_ ") that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than either (A) the Plans in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing with respect to the Continuing Employees or
(B) the employee benefit plans covering similarly-situated employees of
Parent. Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to give credit to
all Continuing Employees for past service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under all Post-Closing Plans including severance pay plans, to
the same extent provided under the corresponding Plans.

(d) With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) or any plan directly or
indirectly maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries providing similar benefits to an "employee welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to cause to be waived any pre-existing condition limitations or
actively-at-work requirements. Parent shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to make appropriate arrangements to allow the use by Continuing
Employees of any amounts available under any cafeteria plan or flexible
spending account (as defined in Section 125 of the Code) which was maintained
prior to the Closing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
such Continuing Employees.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Continuing Employees shall be deemed
employees at will of the Company and its Subsidiaries or their successors,
and nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit the right of Parent, the
Company or the Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Continuing
Employee or modify the terms and conditions of any Continuing Employees
employment. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as limiting or
otherwise modifying any right of any holder of Options otherwise set forth in
this Agreement.

 



64 (f) If directed by Parent no later than five days before the Closing Date,
the Companys board of directors shall adopt resolutions terminating any Plan
that includes a cash or deferred arrangement (within the meaning of Section
401(k) of the Code), with such termination to be effective the day before the
Closing Date. The Company shall provide copies of such resolutions to Parent
for its reasonable review and comment at least two days before adoption of
such resolutions by the Companys board of directors.

 

SECTION 6.17 _280G Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
submit to a stockholder vote (which shall be implemented via written-
consent), in a manner that satisfies the stockholder vote requirements under
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) to receive any and all payments (or other benefits) contingent on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so
that no payment received by such "disqualified individual" shall be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G(b) of the Code (determined without
regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code). Such stockholder vote shall
establish the disqualified individuals right to the payment or other
compensation and the Company shall obtain any required waivers or consents
from the disqualified individual prior to the stockholder vote. In addition,
the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to Company stockholders that
hold Shares of all material facts concerning all payments to any such
disqualified individual that, but for such stockholder vote, could be deemed
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code in a manner that
satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations promulgated
thereunder. Parent and its counsel shall have the right to review and comment
on all documents required to be delivered to the Company stockholders (at
least five Business Days prior to delivery) in connection with such
stockholder vote and any required disqualified individual waivers or consents
(at least five Business Days prior to execution) and Parent and its counsel
shall be provided copies of all vote documents executed by the stockholders
and disqualified individuals.

SECTION 6.18 _Provisions Regarding Legal Representation_. Each of the parties
to this Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP may serve as counsel to each and any
Stockholder and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively,
the " _Holder Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation,
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP
(or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Holder Group or any director,
member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the Holder Group, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation and each of the parties hereto hereby
consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and
each of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive
any conflict of interest arising from such representation.

 



65 ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.1 _Pre-Closing Taxes._

 

(a) The Stockholders and the holders of Cancelled Options, severally (based on
their Pro Rata Shares) and not jointly, will be solely responsible and liable
for all Taxes imposed upon the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such Taxes exceed the amount of such
Taxes accrued and reflected on the final and binding Closing
Statement. Parent and the Company shall seek payment for any amounts due
pursuant to this Section from the Indemnity Escrow Fund prior to seeking
indemnification from the Stockholders or any such holder of Cancelled Options
directly.

 

(b) For purposes of paragraph (a) above, the determination of the Taxes for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined
by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one
that ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other that began at the
beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain,
deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment factors of the
Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable
periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books and
records of the Company were closed at the closing of the Closing Date;
_provided_ _however_ , that (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis, such as depreciation, and (ii) periodic Taxes,
such as property or similar ad valorem Taxes, shall be apportioned ratably
between such periods on the basis of the number of days elapsed in each such
period; and, _provided_   _further_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not apply to any transactions undertaken by Parent on the Closing Date that
are not contemplated by this Agreement or that are outside the ordinary course
of business for the Company and its Subsidiaries and instead any items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit and state and local apportionment
factors applicable thereto shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(c) For Tax purposes, Parent and the Company agree to treat all Tax Deductions
as allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period to the extent permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Stockholder nor
any holder of Cancelled Options shall have any liability to Parent if any Tax
Deductions of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are not available
to Parent, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their Affiliates
for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

SECTION 7.2 _Tax Returns_. The Company shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed, within the time and manner proscribed by Law, all Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed
prior to the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past practice unless required by applicable Law, and prior to
filing, shall be submitted to Parent no later than 45 days prior to the due
date for filing thereof (including applicable extensions) for Parents review
and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or
withheld). Parent shall prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed all
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for 

 



66  any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are required to be filed after the Closing
Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice unless required by applicable Law (as determined by Parent in good
faith) and shall be submitted to the Stockholder Representative no later than
45 days prior to the due date for filing thereof (including applicable
extensions) for the Stockholder Representatives review and approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld). To the
extent Parent has not received approval of such Tax Returns 10 days prior to
the due date for filing thereof (including applicable extensions) such
approval shall be deemed given pursuant to this Agreement unless Stockholder
Representative has provided written notice of an objection to such Tax Return.
Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, Parent shall be
permitted to take all action necessary so that any Pre-Closing Tax Return of
the Company that it is responsible for pursuant to this Section is timely
filed.

SECTION 7.3 _Cooperation_. Parent, the Stockholder Representative, the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and their respective directors, officers and employees
reasonably to cooperate, and use reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective agents, auditors and representatives reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns and in resolving all disputes and audits
with respect to all Taxable periods or relating to Taxes, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes.

SECTION 7.4 _Tax Claims_. If a claim for Taxes, including notice of a pending
or threatened audit, shall be made by any Taxing authority to Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries in writing, which, if successful, would result in an
indemnity payment pursuant to Section 7.5 (a " _Tax Claim_ "), Parent shall
notify the Stockholder Representative in writing of the Tax Claim within 10
days following Parents or any of its Subsidiaries receipt of the written
claim for Taxes. Such notice shall state the nature and basis of the Tax Claim
and the amount thereof, each to the extent known by Parent or any such
Subsidiary. Parent shall have the sole right to represent the interests of
the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax Claim, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Stockholder Representative shall have the right to employ
counsel of its choice at its expense in connection with such Tax Claim and to
participate in any related audit or proceeding and Parent shall inform
Stockholder Representative of the status of any such audit or proceeding,
shall provide the Stockholder Representative with copies of any pleadings,
correspondence, and other documents as the Stockholder Representative may
reasonably request (at the Stockholder Representatives sole expense) and
shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld) of the Stockholder Representative prior to
the settlement of any claim that could reasonably be expected to cause the
Stockholders or holders of Cancelled Options to have an indemnification
obligation pursuant to this Agreement.

 

SECTION 7.5 _Tax Indemnification_. The Stockholders and the holders of
Cancelled Options shall, severally (based on their Pro Rata Shares) and not
jointly, indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent, the Company and its
Subsidiaries against all Stockholder Taxes and against any Loss or expense,
including reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside consultants incurred
in contesting or otherwise in connection with any such Taxes. All claims for
indemnification made pursuant to this Article VII shall be pursued in
accordance with the procedures for indemnification claims in Section 9.7 and
shall be subject to the terms and

 



67  conditions set forth in Section 9.6. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other term or condition of Article IX, (i) claims for indemnification under
this Article VII may only be made prior to the close of business on the 90th
day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the Tax liability in question (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof), (ii) all claims for indemnification made
pursuant to this Article VII shall be subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 9.4(b), (iii) Parent, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall seek a
remedy from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the extent of the amount then held
in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with respect to any indemnification claim
asserted under this Section before seeking to recover directly from the
Stockholders or any holders of Cancelled Options, and (iv) to the extent there
is any inconsistency between the terms of Section 7.4 and Section 9.7, the
provisions of Section 7.4 shall govern.

 

SECTION 7.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by the
Stockholders and the holders of Cancelled Options, on the one hand, and 50%
by Parent, on the other hand. Parent shall accurately file all necessary
Returns and other documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes (" _Transfer
Tax Returns_ "). If required by applicable law, the Stockholders or the
Stockholder Representative will join in the execution of any Transfer Tax
Returns.

SECTION 7.7 _Post-Closing Actions_. Parent shall not (and shall not cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to) amend, re-file or otherwise

Benefits from Compensation Expense (subject to the aggregate $7,000,000 cap in

premiums, regardless of whether such insurance proceeds are received before
or after any related indemnification payments are made under this Article or
Section 7.5. If any such insurance proceeds are received after a related
indemnification payment is made under this Article or Section 7.5, Parent
shall return to the Stockholder Representative (for the benefit of the
Stockholders and the holders of Cancelled Options), within three Business Days
of the receipt of such insurance proceeds (and based on an estimate of the
associated increase in premiums), the applicable portion of such previously
made indemnification payment.

 



73 SECTION 9.7 _Procedures_.

 

(a) In order for a party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out
of or involving a claim or demand made by any third Person against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall
deliver notice thereof to the party from which indemnity is sought (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") as promptly as practicable (and in any event within
five Business Days) after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice
of the Third Party Claim, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed
statement of the basis for such claim and a detailed statement of the amount
of Losses sought (to the extent then known), and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such
notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Indemnifying Parent assumes the defense
of a Third Party Claim, but then fails to diligently defend such claim after
receipt of written notice by the Indemnified Party of the reasons for such
failure and the Indemnifying Party fails to cure such failure within 10
Business Days after receiving such notice, the Indemnified Parent shall have
the right to the reassume the defense thereof at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party is not assuming the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of
such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the
Indemnifying Party or (ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim include
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified
Party shall have been advised by such counsel that there are one or more legal
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys possession or
under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be authorized
to enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to such Third Party Claim without the prior consent of
the Indemnified Party if, and only if, such settlement, compromise or
judgment (A) involves no finding or admission of wrongdoing, (B) includes an
unconditional written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified
Party from all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim and (C) does
not impose equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other
than solely the payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will
be indemnified hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of
the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying
Party.

 



74 (c) The indemnification required hereunder in respect of a Third Party Claim
shall be made by prompt payment by the Indemnifying Party of the amount of
actual Losses in connection therewith (i) in the case of reasonable and
documented legal expenses and other out-of-pocket payments required to be made
by the Indemnified Party, as and when such payments must be and have been
made (so long as such payments may be funded out of the Indemnity Escrow Fund;
if the Indemnity Escrow Fund is insufficient to fund such payments, then such
payments shall be made upon final resolution of such Third Party Claim), and
(ii) in the case of other Losses, upon final resolution of such Third Party
Claim.

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim with reasonable
promptness to the Indemnifying Party, which notice shall include a reasonably
detailed statement of the basis for such claim and a detailed statement of the
amount of Losses sought (to the extent then known), and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to provide such notice,
however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is prejudiced by such failure. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify
the Indemnified Party within 60 days following its receipt of such notice that
the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party, such
claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively
deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on
demand. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser amount than that
claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall pay such
lesser amount promptly to the Indemnified Party, without prejudice to or
waiver of the Indemnified Partys claim for the difference.

(e) For purposes of this Section, (i) if Parent (or any other Parent
Indemnitee) comprises the Indemnified Party, any references to the
Indemnifying Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make any
payments) shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholder Representative, and (ii)
if Parent comprises the Indemnifying Party, any references to the Indemnified
Party shall be deemed to refer to the Stockholder Representative. Any payment
received by the Stockholder Representative shall be distributed to the
Stockholders and the holders of Cancelled Options in accordance with this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.8 _Indemnity Escrow Fund_.

(a) The sole and exclusive source for the recovery of the Parent Indemnitees
of any indemnification obligations payable under Section 9.2(a) (except with
respect to the Core Reps and the Tax Rep) shall be the Indemnity Escrow Fund.
Parent shall seek a remedy from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, to the extent of
the amount then held in the Indemnity Escrow Fund, with respect to any
indemnification claim asserted hereunder before seeking to recover any Losses
directly from the Stockholders or any holders of Cancelled Options. 

 



75 (b) Upon the termination of the Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall pay any amounts remaining in the
Escrow Fund to the Stockholders (other than holders of any Dissenting Shares)
and the holders of Cancelled Options as instructed by the Stockholder
Representative. Payment of such amounts shall be made to the Stockholders and
such Cancelled Option holders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares.

Agreement; or

 

(ii) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall
have issued a judgment, order, injunction, rule or decree, or taken any other

decree or other action shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_
, that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
paragraph (ii) shall have complied with its obligations under Section 6.9; or

 

(c) by Parent:

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company shall have
become untrue, which breach or failure to perform or to be true, either
individually or in the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Effective
Time, (A) would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth
in Section 8.1 or 8.3 and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date; _provided_
, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this paragraph (i) if Parent or Merger Sub is then in material breach of any

shares of Common Stock held by such holders shall fail to be delivered to the

individually or in the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Effective
Time, (A) would result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.1 or 8.2 and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to this paragraph (i) if it is then in material breach of any of its
covenants, agreements or representations or warranties set forth in this
Agreement; or

(ii) if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before the third
Business Day after the date it was required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2
and all of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.3 continue to be
satisfied at the time of such termination (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), and the Company shall have
provided written notice to Parent on the date the Closing was required to
occur pursuant to Section 2.2 and at the time of termination that the Company
is ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger on such date and at the
time of termination (it being understood that Parent shall not be entitled to
terminate this Agreement during such three-Business Day period following the
Companys delivery of such notice).

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section (other

Company, _provided_ , that:

termination hereof;

(b) the Company or Parent may have liability as provided in Section 10.3;

 



77 (c) subject to Section 10.3(c) (including the limitation on liability set

fraud, in which case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all rights
and remedies available at law or in equity. " _Willful Breach_ " shall mean a
deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, which act or failure to act
constitutes in and of itself a breach of this Agreement, regardless of whether
breaching was the conscious object of the act or failure to act; and

(d) in the case of any damages sought by the Company from Parent or Merger
Sub, including for any Willful Breach, such damages may be based on the
consideration that would have otherwise been payable to the Stockholders and
holders of Options pursuant to this Agreement.

(a) _Generally._ Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all fees and

failure of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby or thereby
to be consummated, or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to
be have been made in connection herewith or therewith, whether in equity or at
law, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and in such event, the Company shall

GENERAL PROVISIONS

SECTION 11.1 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the parties at any time prior to the Effective
Time, (notwithstanding any stockholder approval);  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after approval of the transactions contemplated hereby by the
stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made which pursuant to
applicable Law requires further approval by such stockholders without
such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties in interest at the time of the
amendment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Sections
10.3(c), 11.7(b), 11.9(b) and (c) and 11.13 and this Section may not be
modified, waived or terminated in a manner that materially impacts or is
adverse in any material respect to the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



79 SECTION 11.2 _Extension_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the parties. Any

set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party.

may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in

herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party
in exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies
which they would otherwise have hereunder.

Agreements brought by any party or its

 



82  Affiliates against any other party or its Affiliates shall be brought and
determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, _provided_ that
if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware, then any such legal action or proceeding may be brought in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any other Delaware state
court. Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of
the aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally
and unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements. Each of the
parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto
except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware as described herein. Each of the
parties further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute
sufficient service of process and the parties further waive any argument that
such service is insufficient. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
foregoing, this paragraph (a) shall not apply with respect to any legal action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to the Holder Agreements.

(b) _Limitation on Suits Against Parent Parties._ Without limiting Sections

this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
against, any other Parent Party.

 

(c) _Limitation on Suits Against Financing Sources._ Without limiting Section
10.3(c) or paragraph (b) above, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements executed in connection therewith or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the
federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York (and appellate courts thereof).

 

(d) _Waivers._ Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware (or New York, as applicable) as described herein for any reason, (b)
that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or

 



83  proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement,
or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

SECTION 11.10 _Assignment; Successors_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of Parent (in the case of an assignment by
the Company) or the Company (in the case of an assignment by Parent or Merger
Sub), and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null
and void; _provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment shall limit the
assignors obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

SECTION 11.11 _Specific Performance_.

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly,
subject to paragraph (b) below, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Company shall be entitled
to seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger only if:

 

(i) all conditions in Sections 8.1 and 8.3 (other than those conditions that
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied;

(ii) Parent and Merger Sub have failed to complete the Closing by the date
the Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section 2.2;

(iii) the Financing (or any equity financing substituted or deemed
substituted in whole or in part therefor pursuant to Section 6.12(a)) has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing; and

(iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if specific performance is
granted and the Financing (or any equity financing substituted or deemed
substituted in whole or in part therefor pursuant to Section 6.12(a)) is
funded, then the Closing will occur.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent and Merger Sub to draw
down the Financing (or any replacement financing) only if the Closing
(including consummation of the Merger) will occur substantially simultaneously
with such draw down.

 



84 (d) Each of the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (i) it has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

SECTION 11.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this Section with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

SECTION 11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND BY THE ANCILLARY
AGREEMENTS.

 

SECTION 11.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of this Agreement by facsimile or other electronic image
scan transmission shall be effective as delivery of an original counterpart
hereof.

SECTION 11.15 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.
