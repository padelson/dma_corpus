 __THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _ _Agreement__ "), dated as of
September 9, 2015, by and among XPO Logistics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(" _ _Parent__ "), Canada Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _ _Merger Sub__ ") and Con-way Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the " _ _Company__ "). __

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _ _Company Board__ ")
has (i) determined that this Agreement is in the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, and has adopted, approved and declared advisable
this Agreement providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the
Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _ _DGCL__ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement (the " _ _Merger__ "), and (ii) subject to the
terms hereof, resolved to recommend to the stockholders of the Company to
tender their Shares into the Offer;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub have
each adopted, approved and declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement
providing for the Merger in accordance with the DGCL, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a
tender offer (the " _ _Offer__ ") to purchase any (subject to the Minimum
Condition) and all of the outstanding common stock, par value $0.625 per
share, of the Company (each, a " _ _Share__ " or, collectively, the " _
_Shares__ ") (other than Shares canceled or converted pursuant to _Section
2.1(b)_), at a price per share of Common Stock of $47.60 (such amount or any
higher amount per share of Common Stock that may be paid pursuant to an
amended Offer, the " _ _Offer Price__ "), payable net to the seller in cash,
without interest;

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with
and into the Company, with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent in accordance with the DGCL, and each Share outstanding
that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than shares
canceled or converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares)
will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price, in each case, on the terms and conditions
set forth herein;

WHEREAS, the Merger shall be governed by and effected pursuant to Section
251(h) of the DGCL; and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, intending to be
legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

 _The Offer and the Merger_

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

 __(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in
accordance with _Article VI_ , Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later
than the date that is ten (10) days after the date of the initial public
announcement of this Agreement, commence (within the meaning of Rule
14d-2 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _
_Exchange Act__ ")) the Offer. __

__(b) The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver (as provided in Section 1.1(c)) of the
conditions set forth in Annex A (the " _ _Offer Conditions__ ") (without
limiting the right of Merger Sub to terminate, extend or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and not to any other conditions.
On the terms and subject to the Offer Conditions and this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _
_Tendered Shares__ ") as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date (
_provided_ that if the Expiration Date is the Outside Date, such acceptance
shall occur on the Outside Date) and in compliance with applicable Law. The
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _ _Offer Closing__ ," and
the date and time at which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _ _Acceptance Time__." Parent shall provide, or cause to
be provided, to Merger Sub on the date of the Offer Closing funds necessary to
purchase and pay for any and all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement. __

(c) The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
and Parent and Merger Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition
at any time and from time to time, in their sole and absolute discretion,
other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
only with the prior written consent of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub
expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions, to increase
the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of
the Offer; _provided_ that, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not: (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in
the Offer, (iii) impose conditions on the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions or amend any Offer Condition, (iv) waive or amend the Minimum
Condition, (v) amend any other term of the Offer in a manner that is adverse
to the holders of Shares, or (vi) extend (or make any other amendment that
would have the effect of extending) the Expiration Date (as defined below)
except as required or permitted by _Section 1.1(e)_.

 

(d) On the date the Offer is commenced, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _ _SEC__ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which Tender Offer Statement

 



2  shall include an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, summary
advertisement and other required ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO
and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made,
together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _ _Offer
Documents__ ") and cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders
of Shares as, and to the extent, required by applicable Law. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion of the recommendation of the Company Board
that the Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer (the " _ _Company Recommendation__ ") in the Offer
Documents provided that there has not been a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or an Intervening Event Recommendation Change. Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, cause the Offer Documents to comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law. The
Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Shares that may be required to be
set forth in the Offer Documents or reasonably requested in connection with
any action contemplated by this _Section 1.1(d)_, including communication of
the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Each of the parties
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to
take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall
provide the Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments
(and shall orally describe any oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior
to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement
thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by the
Company. Parent and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to any such SEC comments.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the
Offer shall remain open until 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on the twenty-
first (21st) business day (for purposes of this _Section 1.1(e)_ calculated
in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date
that the Offer is commenced (the " _ _Initial Expiration Date__ ") or, if the
period of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant
to, and in accordance with, this _Section 1.1(e)_ or as may be required
by applicable Law, the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended
(the Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date to which the Offer
has been extended in accordance with this _Section 1.1(e)_, the " _
_Expiration Date__ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, on the then-
effective Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer for successive periods of not more than five (5) business days (the
length of such period to be determined by Parent or Merger Sub in their sole
discretion), or for such longer period as the parties may agree, in order to
permit the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions, and (ii) Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period required
by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its staff
applicable to the Offer or necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC or
its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents; _provided_ that, in
the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , Merger Sub

 



3  shall not in any event be required to, and without the Companys prior
written consent shall not, extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not extend the Offer. Nothing in this _Section 1.1(e)_ shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Article VI_.
In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any
event within one (1) business day of such termination) terminate the Offer.
If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Article VI_ , prior to the acceptance for
payment of Shares tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly return, and shall cause any depository
acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the
registered holders thereof. Merger Sub shall not withdraw the Offer unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Article VI_.

1.2 _Company Action_.

 

 __(a) The Company shall file with the SEC on the day the Offer Documents are
filed with the SEC (or on such day as may be agreed by the parties, but in
any event in accordance with applicable Law), a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the Offer (together with any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _ _Schedule 14D-9__") that contains
the Company Recommendation and the notice and other information required by
Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL, and shall promptly disseminate the Schedule
14D-9 to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable
Law, including by setting the Stockholder List Date as the record date for the
purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The
Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof furnish to the
Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub that may be required
or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9.
Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it
for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by applicable Law. The Company shall provide
Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with any written comments (and
shall orally describe any oral comments) that the Company or its counsel may
receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments. Unless the Company
Board has effected a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or an Intervening
Event Recommendation Change, prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination
thereof to the holders of Shares, or responding to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent and
Merger Sub with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the Company shall give reasonable
consideration to any comments provided by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any such SEC
comments. __

 



4 (b) The Company shall reasonably promptly after the date hereof provide to
Parent, or cause to be provided to Parent, a true and complete copy of a list
of the holders of Shares as well as mailing labels and any available listing
or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record and, to the
extent available to the Company, beneficial holders of Shares and lists of
securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each case in the
Companys possession or control as of the most recent practicable date and
shall promptly furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and
assistance (including updated lists of the record and beneficial holders of
Shares, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or its
agents may reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the
holders of Shares (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom
the Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _
_Stockholder List Date__ "). Subject to the requirements of applicable Law,
and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Parent and Sub shall not use or disclose the information
contained in such labels, lists, listings and files other than in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement is terminated, shall,
upon request, deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information
then in their possession or control. 

(c) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub
effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

1.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time and in accordance with Section 251(h) of
the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and the separate corporate
existence of the Company under the Laws of the State of Delaware, with all of
its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue
unaffected by the Merger, except as otherwise set forth in this _Article I_.

 

1.4 _Consummation of the Merger_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing
between the Company and Parent, the closing for the Merger (the " _
_Closing__ ") shall take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York 10019 as soon as possible
following the Offer Closing on the business day (the " _ _Closing Date__ ")
on which the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth in
_Article V_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this Agreement.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean any
day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Saturday or Sunday or a
day on which banks are required or authorized to remain closed in the City of
New York, New York.

1.5  _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause the certificate of merger (the " _ _Certificate
of Merger__ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective
at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as Parent and the Company
shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _ _Effective
Time__ ").

 



5 1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects provided for in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of
the DGCL.

1.7 _Charter and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the " _ _Charter__ ") shall be amended as a
result of the Merger to be in a form of the Certificate of Incorporation of
Merger Sub and, as so amended, shall be the charter of the Surviving
Corporation, until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws. The
bylaws of Merger Sub (the " _ _Bylaws__ ") in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Laws.

1.8 _Officers and Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The officers of
Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have
been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws. Subject
to applicable Law, the directors of Merger Sub shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time until their successors shall
have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

ARTICLE II

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each Share of the Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by
Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent (including Shares accepted in the Offer) and not, in each case, held
on behalf of third parties, (ii) Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company and not, in each case, held on behalf of third
parties (each of the Shares in clauses (i) and (ii), an " _ _Excluded Share__
" and collectively, " _ _Excluded Share__ _s ___ __"), and (iii) Dissenting
Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount
in cash equal to the Offer Price (the " _ _Per Share Merger Consideration__
"). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares shall cease to be outstanding,
shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate formerly
representing Shares (a " _ _Certificate__ ") or non-certificated Shares held
in book-entry position formerly representing Shares (the " _ _Book-Entry
Shares__ "), as the case may be, formerly representing any of the Shares
(other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest.

 



6 (b) _Cancellation and Conversion of Excluded Shares_.

 

(i) Each Excluded Share referred to in _Section 2.1(a)_ (other than any such
Excluded Shares converted into shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(ii))_ and each Share, if any, owned
directly by the Company shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and shall cease to
exist.

(ii) Each Share held by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company, any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or any direct
or indirect Subsidiary of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that the ownership
percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage of such
Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 __(d) _Dissenters  Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary and to the extent available under Section 262 of the DGCL, any
Share that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
held by a Company stockholder who complies in all respects with all of the
provisions of the DGCL relevant to the exercise and perfection of dissenters
rights (such Share being a " _ _Dissenting Share__ ," and such Company
stockholder being a " _ _Dissenting Stockholder__ "), shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the
holder of such share would be entitled pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ but
rather shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect such
stockholders dissenters rights under the DGCL or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such rights with respect to any Dissenting Shares, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be converted into the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, the consideration referred to in
_Section 2.1(a)_, pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth in  _Section
2.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of a Company stockholder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt
notice of any demand for payment of the fair value of any shares of Company
Stock or any attempted withdrawal of any such demand for payment and
any other instrument served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to any stockholders dissenters rights and (ii) the opportunity to
lead all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
payment under the DGCL. The Company shall not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demand for appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares
without the prior written consent of Parent. __

 



7 2.2 _Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall
be appointed to act as a Paying Agent hereunder and approved in advance by the
Company (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) (and pursuant to an
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and
the Company) (the " _ _Paying Agent__ "), in trust in a separate account for
the benefit of holders of Shares, an amount in cash in immediately available
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration under _Section 2.1(a)_ (such cash deposited with the
Paying Agent being hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Payment Fund__ ").

 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
business days), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each holder of record, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal
in customary form specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.2(f)_) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to (A)
the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in
lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or Book-Entry Shares
multiplied by (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, as applicable. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check
for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be
issued to such transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares
is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registrations of transfer on the stock transfer books of the Company of the
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled
and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to which the
holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



8 (d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of the Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment
of the Per Share Merger Consideration upon due surrender of its Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.2(f)_) or
Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount
required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-for-
profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity or
other entity of any kind or nature. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _ _Governmental Entity__ " shall mean any United States or foreign
governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body, court or other
legislative, executive or judicial governmental entity.

 

(e) _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
under this Agreement (including the Offer and Merger), such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which such deduction and withholding were made.

 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
(satisfactory to the Paying Agent, acting reasonably) of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount
and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to
such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate as contemplated
by this _Article II_.

 

2.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Options and SARs_. Unless otherwise agreed to by Parent and selected
holders thereof in writing, at the Effective Time, each outstanding equity
award granted under the Stock Plans that is an option to purchase Shares (a "
_ _Company Option__ ") and each stock appreciation right (" _ _SAR__ "),
whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an option to
purchase

 



9  shares of Parent common stock (an " _ _Adjusted Option__ ") or a stock
appreciation right in respect of Parent common stock (an " _ _Adjusted SAR__
"), as applicable, in each case, on the same terms and conditions as were
applicable under such Company Option or SAR immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including vesting terms and conditions), with the number of shares of
Parent common stock (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares)
subject to such Adjusted Option or Adjusted SAR equal to the product of (i)
the total number of Shares underlying such Company Option or SAR immediately
prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion
Amount (as defined below), and with the exercise price applicable to such
Adjusted Option or Adjusted SAR to equal the quotient (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (1) the exercise price per Share
applicable to such Company Option or SAR immediately prior to the Effective
Time, by (2) the Equity Award Conversion Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent common stock underlying
the Adjusted Option or Adjusted SAR shall be determined in a manner consistent
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _ _Code__ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that, in the case of
any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise
price and the number of shares of Parent common stock underlying the
corresponding Adjusted Option shall be determined in accordance with the
foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _ _Equity Award Conversion Amount__ " means the quotient
obtained by dividing the Per Share Merger Consideration by the volume-weighted
average trading price of the Parent common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange (the " _ _NYSE__ ") as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for the
five (5) consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately
preceding the Closing Date.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding
restricted stock award (a " _ _Restricted Stock Award__ "), granted under the
Stock Plans shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof
to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the

Restricted Stock Award, determined in accordance with _Section 2.1(a)_ of
this Agreement, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment.

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Unless otherwise agreed to by
Parent and selected holders thereof in writing, at the Effective Time, (i)
each outstanding restricted stock unit award (an " _ _RSU__ ") granted under
the Stock Plans that is scheduled to vest on or prior to February 29, 2016
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, accelerate in full and be cancelled and shall only entitle the
holder thereof to receive as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event
later than thirty (30) days, after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such RSU, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld and (ii) each RSU that is scheduled
to vest following February 29, 2016 shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into a
restricted stock unit award (an " _ _Adjusted RSU__ ") with the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including vesting and settlement terms and conditions), and
relating to the number of shares of Parent common stock equal to the product
of (i) the number of Shares subject to such RSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount, with
any fractional shares rounded to the nearest whole number of shares.

 



10 (d) _Treatment of Performance Share Plan Units_. Unless otherwise agreed to by
Parent and selected holders thereof in writing, at the Effective Time, (i)
each outstanding award of performance-share plan units (" _ _PSPU__ ") granted
under the Stock Plans that is scheduled to vest on or prior to February
29, 2016 shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, accelerate in full (with the performance-based vesting
conditions deemed satisfied at target) and be cancelled and shall only entitle
the holder thereof to receive as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than thirty (30) days, after the Effective Time (or such later
time as required under Section 409A of the Code), the Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares subject to such PSPU, less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld and (ii) each PSPU that is scheduled
to vest following February 29, 2016 shall, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into an award of
performance-share plan units (an " _ _Adjusted PSPU__ ") with the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such PSPU immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including time-based vesting terms and settlement terms and
conditions, but excluding performance-based vesting terms), and relating to
the number of shares of Parent common stock equal to the product of (i) the
number of Shares subject to such PSPU immediately prior to the Effective Time
(with the performance-based vesting conditions deemed satisfied at target),
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount, with any fractional
shares rounded to the nearest whole number of shares.

 

(e) _Treatment of Phantom Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each phantom
stock unit under the Con-way Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee
Directors (Amended and Restated 2008), the Con-way 2005 Deferred Compensation
Plan for Non-Employee Directors (Amended and Restated December 2008), the Con-
way 2005 Deferred Compensation Plan for Executives and Key Employees
(Amended and Restated December 2008), and the Con-way 1993 Deferred
Compensation Plan for Executives and Key Employees (Amended and Restated
December 2008) (a " _ _Phantom Share__ "), shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be deemed to be an
obligation relating to shares of Parent common stock (an " _ _Adjusted Phantom
Share__ "), with the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
Phantom Share immediately prior to the Effective Time (including vesting and
settlement terms and conditions), and relating to the number of shares of
Parent common stock equal to the product of the (i) the number of Shares in
respect of a Phantom Share immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (ii) the Equity Award Conversion Amount, with any fractional
shares rounded to the nearest whole number of shares.

 

(f) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall take all actions necessary to implement the provisions of
_Sections 2.3(a)_, _2.3(b)_ , _2.3(c)_ , _2.3(d)_ and _2.3(e)_ , and Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary
to implement the provisions of _Sections 2.3(a)_, _2.3(b)_ , _2.3(c)_ ,
_2.3(d)_ , and _2.3(e)_. No later than the Effective Time, Parent shall
prepare and have on file with the SEC an effective registration statement on
an appropriate form (including Form S-8 or other applicable form) with respect
to the shares of Parent common stock subject to the Adjusted Options, Adjusted
SARs, Adjusted RSUs, Adjusted PSPUs, and Adjusted Phantom Shares. 

 



11 2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),

exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Offer Price, the Per Share
Merger Consideration and payments pursuant to _Section 2.3_ shall be
equitably adjusted; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.4_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable following the
Offer Closing without a meeting of the Companys stockholders, as provided in

_Rights__ "), and no such Rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. None
of the Companys Subsidiaries own any shares of capital stock of the Company.

 



15 (iv) Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the
Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns
beneficially or of record any shares of capital stock or other Rights in any

corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in
order to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and the Merger. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of Parent and
Merger Sub, constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights and to general equity principles regardless of whether enforcement is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (the " _ _Bankruptcy and Equity
Exception__ "). Assuming the Merger is consummated in accordance with Section
251(h) of the DGCL, no stockholder votes or consents are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Offer and the Merger. The
Company Board has determined that the Offer and the Merger are in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders, adopted, approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Transactions and resolved, subject to

registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations required to be obtained by
the Company from, any Governmental Entity in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
of the Transactions, except those that the failure to make or obtain would
not, (x) individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (y) prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the consummation of the Transactions.

 



16 (ii) Assuming compliance with the matters referenced in  _Section 3.1(d)(i)_
and receipt of the Company Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the consummation of the
Transactions by the Company will not constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the Charter or Bylaws of the Company or the
comparable governing instruments of any of its Significant Subsidiaries, (B)
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,
a termination or a recapture (or right of termination or recapture) or a
default under, the creation or acceleration of any obligations pursuant to,

arrangement or other instrument or obligation (each, a " _ _Contract__ ")

on any of the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) a
violation of, or conflict with, any Order or Laws to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C)
above, for any such breach, violation, termination, default, creation,

respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange

the Company pursuant to the Securities Act since January 1, 2012, as of the
date such statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be

assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2013. The Company
maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined by Rule 13a-15 or
15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure controls and procedures are,
in all material respects, effective to ensure that all information required
to be disclosed by the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the
Companys filings with the SEC to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and
the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. The Company has disclosed, based on

its Subsidiaries (the " _ _Company Employees__ "), current or former
independent contractors of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or current or
former directors of the Company, in each case, working outside of the United
States (a " _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ ")) and each such Benefit Plan that has
received a favorable opinion letter from the Internal Revenue Service (the " _
_IRS__ ") has been separately identified. True and complete copies of, to the

terms and with ERISA and the Code (to the extent applicable) and other
applicable Laws and there is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened action or litigation relating to the Benefit Plans, other

(an " _ _ERISA Plan__ ") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a " _ _Pension Plan__ ") intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received or may rely on a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS (and a true and correct
copy of such letter or such application has been provided to Parent), and
each trust forming a part thereof is exempt from federal income tax pursuant
to Section 501(a) of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any
circumstances reasonably likely to result in the loss of the

 



20  qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or any fiduciary has engaged in a
transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction expired as of the date hereof, could subject any ERISA
Plan or any related trust, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
person that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to
indemnify, to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which would be material.

 

(iii) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412, 430, or 4971 of the Code: (A) no such Benefit
Plan is in "at-risk" status for purposes of Section 430 of the Code, (B)no

incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and (E) the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such Benefit Plan.

(iv) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would
reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that
would be a liability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its affiliates
following the Closing. " _ _Controlled Group Liability__ " means any and all
liabilities (A) under Title IV of ERISA, (B) under Section 302 of ERISA, (C)
under Sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (D) as a result of a failure to
comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 _et
seq_. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code, or (E) that would be material
to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole under corresponding or
similar provisions of foreign Laws or regulations.

 

(v) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries, nor any other entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an " _ _ERISA Affiliate__ ") has, at any time during
the last six (6) years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any
plan that is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3)
of ERISA (a " _ _Multiemployer Plan__ ") or a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control,
within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _ _Multiple Employer Plan__
"), and, during the six (6) years prior to the date hereof, none of the
Company and its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any ERISA
Affiliate has incurred any liability to a Multiemployer Plan or Multiple
Employer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal (as those terms
are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) from a Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan that has not been satisfied in full. Neither
the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has engaged in any transaction described
in Section 4069, 4202(a) or 4212(c) of ERISA.

 

(vi) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, each Benefit Plan that is in any part a "nonqualified
deferred compensation plan"

 



21  subject to Section 409A of the Code (excluding any Benefit Plans or portion
of a Benefit Plan grandfathered under Section 409A of the Code, which the
Company represents have not been modified or operated in a manner that would
be reasonably expected to jeopardize such grandfathered status) materially
complies and, at all times has materially complied, both in form and
operation, with the requirements of, and has not resulted in the application
of any penalty tax under, Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations
and other applicable guidance thereunder.

 

(vii) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the Transactions will, either alone or in combination with
another event, (A) entitle any Company Employee, any current or former
independent contractor, or any current or former officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any payment or benefit (including
any enhanced or accelerated benefit, or lapse of repurchase rights or
obligations, with respect to any Stock Plans or other benefit under any
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company), (B) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
Company Employee, independent contractor, officer or director, or result in
any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Benefit
Plan or related trust, or (C) result in any payment (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such
term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that would
(individually or in combination with any other such payment) constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). The
execution of this Agreement (either alone or in conjunction with any other
event) shall not result in the funding of any grantor, "rabbi" or similar
trust pursuant to any Benefit Plan, and the Company has taken, or has caused
its applicable Subsidiaries to take, all actions necessary to amend any
Benefit Plans, trust agreements, or documents that might otherwise have
required grantor, "rabbi" or similar trust funding as a result of the
execution of this Agreement, so that no such requirement shall take effect.

 

(viii) No Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Sections 4999 or 409A of the Code.

 

(ix) No Benefit Plan provides welfare benefits, including death or medical
benefits (whether or not insured), beyond retirement or termination of

a " _ _Retiree Plan__ "). The Company or its applicable Subsidiary has the
right to amend, terminate or modify any Retiree Plan at any time.

expected to be materially adverse to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken

with a Governmental Authority has been registered (and where applicable
accepted for registration) and has been maintained in good standing with the
applicable Governmental Entity, (B) if it is intended to qualify for special
tax treatment, meets all requirements for such treatment, (C) if it is
intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, is fully funded and/or book-
reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions, and

 



22  (D) has been maintained and operated in accordance with, and is in
compliance with, its terms, all applicable laws, government taxation and
funding requirements, and with any agreement entered into with a union or
labor organization. There is no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened material litigation relating to any Non-U.S. Benefit Plan.

and receipt of the Parent Approvals, the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by

equity whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Assuming the
Financing is received as contemplated by the Commitment Letter, the aggregate
amount of net proceeds from the Financing, together with cash, cash
equivalents and current financial assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries on
hand, will be, as of the Closing Date, sufficient to satisfy all of the
Parents obligations under this Agreement, including the payment of any
Subject Indebtedness required to be repaid, redeemed, retired, cancelled,
terminated or otherwise satisfied or discharged in connection with the Offer
or the Merger and all other costs and expenses required to be paid or
satisfied by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There are no side letters or other agreements, contracts or
arrangements relating to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
other than the Ancillary Letters and customary engagement letters,
which engagement letters do not contain any condition to the availability or
timing of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. As of the date
of this Agreement, (A) no event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach by the Parent and
(B) subject to the

 



36  satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section 5.1 and Annex A hereof,
Parent does not have any reason to believe that the Financing contemplated by
the Commitment Letter will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub at the
Closing. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other fees, if any,
required by the Commitment Letter to be paid prior to the date of this
Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter.

(f)  _Brokers and Finders_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
(including Merger Sub) has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with the Transactions, except that Parent has employed J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC and Morgan Stanley and Co. LLC as financial advisors.

(g)  _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger
Sub consists solely of 100 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will
be, owned by Parent or direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent.
Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, prior to the Effective Time,
will not have engaged in any business activities, other than activities
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(h) _Ownership of Company Capital Stock; Certain Arrangements_. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
owns, nor will they own prior to the Closing Date (directly or indirectly,
beneficially or of record), or is a party to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of,
in each case, any shares of capital stock of the Company or other securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any equity securities of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than as contemplated by this Agreement). There are
no agreements, arrangements or understandings between Parent, Merger Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
member of the Companys management or directors, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the Company or the Transactions. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries, or the "affiliates" or "associates" of any such entity
is, and at no time during the last three (3) years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company, in each case as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL. Other than this Agreement, there are no Contracts or any commitments to
enter into any Contract between Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any director, officer, employee or
stockholder of the Company, on the other hand, relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the operations of the Surviving Corporation
after the Effective Time.

(i) _Offering Documents and Schedule 14D-9_. None of the information to
be supplied in writing by Parent, Merger Sub or any Representative of Parent
or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Offering Documents or Schedule
14D-9, if any, will, at the time such document is filed with the SEC, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The Offer Documents shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act.

 



37 (j) _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay
or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates. Assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions
contained in Section 5.1 and Annex A hereof and (ii) the accuracy as of the
Effective Time of the representations and warranties of the Company in
_Section 3.1_ in all material respects, the Surviving Corporation will, after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the payment of the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, all
amounts to be paid pursuant to this Agreement and all costs and expenses of
the Merger (including any repayment or refinancing of Subject Indebtedness)
and all other amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, be Solvent at and
immediately after the Effective Time. As used in this _Section 3.2(j)_,
the term "Solvent" means, with respect to a particular date, that on such
date, (a) the sum of the assets, at a fair valuation, of a person (on a
consolidated basis) will exceed such persons debts, (b) such person (on
a consolidated basis with its subsidiaries) has not incurred and does not
intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as such debts
mature in the ordinary course of business and (c) such person (on a
consolidated basis with its subsidiaries) has sufficient capital and
liquidity with which to conduct its business. For purposes of this Section
3.2(j), "debt" means any liability on a claim, and "claim" means any (y) right
to payment, whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated,
unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed,
legal, equitable, secured or unsecured, and (z) any right to an equitable
remedy for breach of performance if such breach gives rise to a payment,
whether or not such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or
unsecured.

 

(k) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company makes, or has made, any other express
or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company or the Transactions and any other assets, rights or
obligations to be transferred hereunder or pursuant hereto, and Parent and
Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty, and the Company
disclaims any other representations or warranties, whether made by the
Company, any of its Affiliates or their respective Representatives, except
for the representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.1_ (as
modified by the Company Disclosure Letter) or the certificate delivered
pursuant to _clause (c)(vii)_ of _Annex A_.

and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its Representatives to: (i)
immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal,
and promptly (but in any event within one (1) business day) after the date of
this Agreement, if not already done so prior to the date of this Agreement,
instruct any Person who entered into a confidentiality agreement with the
Company that has not expired or been terminated in connection with any actual
or potential Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all such information or
documents in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement and
(ii) from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier,
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article VI_, not,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information)
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) other than informing Persons of the provisions contained in this

necessary to take any actions that the Company or any third party would
otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this _Section 4.2_ (and in such
case only in accordance with the terms hereof), (i) the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify

steps necessary to terminate any waiver that may have been heretofore granted,
to any Person other than Parent or any of Parents Affiliates, under any such
provisions.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 4.2(a)_ or
any other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time from and after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company receives
a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal from any Person,
under circumstances not involving any breach of this  _Section 4.2_, if the
Company Board determines in good faith, (x) after consultation with outside
financial advisors and based on the advice of outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Superior Proposal and (y) after consultation with outside counsel, in light of
such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to constitute a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, then the Company may, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, (i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person who has made such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ that the Company shall not provide any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to such Person
unless such non-public information has been previously provided to, or is
substantially simultaneously provided to, Parent and (ii) engage in or
otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal and such
Persons Representatives. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement__ " means any customary confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable in any material respect
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated
July 28, 2015, between the Company and Parent (the " _ _Confidentiality
Agreement__ ") (including standstill restrictions), provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with
any of the provisions of this _Section 4.2_.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt) notify Parent (which notice shall be provided orally and
in writing and shall identify the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and
set forth in reasonable detail the material terms thereof) after receipt of
any Acquisition Proposal, and shall promptly (and in no event later
than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any
written proposals or indications of interest with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal, and/or draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent informed of any
material developments regarding any Acquisition Proposal (including by
promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt)
providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written proposals or
indications of interest with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, and/or
draft agreements relating to such Acquisition Proposal) on a reasonably prompt
basis (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) and upon the request
of Parent shall apprise Parent of the status of such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter into any agreement
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
_Section 4.2_.

 



44 (d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 4.2(d)_, the Company Board
shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule
14D-9 or any amendment thereof, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer that
constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (other than a recommendation against such
offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case that
includes a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) (it being understood
that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to such
a tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the tenth
(10th) business day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange
offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and that a statement
that the Company Board recommends against acceptance of such tender or
exchange offer but, in accordance with this _Section 4.2_, is engaging in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such tender or exchange
offer, shall not be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change so
long as such statement also expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company
Recommendation) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company an Acquisition
Proposal, or (E) fail to publicly recommend against an Acquisition Proposal
and reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten (10) business days of the
request of Parent (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to
as a " _ _Company Adverse Recommendation Change__ "), or (ii) authorize, cause
or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _Section 4.2(b)_). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Company Board may (x) make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
(y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_, if, after
receiving such _bona fide_ , unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board has determined in good faith, (I) after consultation with its outside
legal counsel, that in light of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to so
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to result in a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties, and (II)
after consultation with outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, prior to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
(1) the Company has given Parent at least five (5) business days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
include a copy of the Superior Proposal and a copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements and a copy of any financing commitments relating
thereto) (it being agreed that neither the delivery of such a notice nor any
public announcement thereof, which announcement the Company has determined in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel it is required to
make under Law shall constitute a Company Adverse Recommendation Change so
long as such public announcement also expressly and concurrently reaffirms
the Company Recommendation), (2) to the extent requested by Parent, the
Company and its respective officers and directors have negotiated, and the
Company has used reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period to enable
Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would
cause such Superior

 



45  Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following the end
of such notice period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith
any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent,
and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal would
nevertheless continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the revisions
proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (4) in the event of each and
every change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount and
timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent
an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (1) above of
this proviso and a new notice period under clause (1) of this proviso shall
commence, during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 4.2(d)_ anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (1) through (4) above of this proviso; and
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that the Company has complied in all material
respect with its obligations under this _Section 4.2_.

__(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation (" _ _Intervening Event Recommendation Change__ "), if, in
response to an Intervening Event, the Company Board has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to
make such Intervening Event Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected
to result in constitute a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law and, in such event, shall not be obligated to include
the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such action shall not be in response to an Acquisition Proposal or a
Superior Proposal (which is addressed under  _Section 4.2(d)_) and prior to
taking such action, (i) the Company Board has given Parent at least five (5)
business days prior written notice of its intention to make such Intervening
Event Recommendation Change and a reasonable description of the Intervening
Event that serves as the basis of such Intervening Event Recommendation Change
(it being agreed that neither the delivery of such a notice nor any public
announcement thereof that the Company has determined in good faith after
consultation with its outside legal counsel it is required to make under Law
shall constitute an Intervening Adverse Recommendation Change so long as such
public announcement also expressly and concurrently reaffirms the
Company Recommendation), (ii) the Company and its directors and officers have
negotiated, and has it has used reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice
period after giving any such notice, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement in such a manner that would obviate the need for making such
Intervening Event Recommendation Change, and (iii) at the end of such notice
period, the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any revisions to
the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that failure to make an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would
nevertheless constitute a violation of the Company Boards fiduciary duties
under applicable Law if the revisions proposed were to be given effect (
_provided_ that any change to the material facts and circumstances relating
to such Intervening Event shall not require a new notice and shall not require
such party to further comply with the requirements of this _Section 4.2(e)_,
including clauses (i) through (iii) above of this proviso). __

its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the Company Boards
determination in good faith based on the advice of outside counsel, the
failure to so disclose would constitute a violation of the Company Boards
fiduciary duties under applicable Law or its obligations under applicable
federal securities Law; _provided_ that any such position or disclosure (other
than any stop, look and listen communication that includes a reaffirmation of
the Company Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently
reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

beneficiaries, or any other Person or (B) any right to continued
employment with the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.8_ is intended to be or

such Indemnified Parties service as a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Indemnified
Parties at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including the Transactions. Each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall also pay expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an
Indemnified Party in advance of the final disposition of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws, _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses
are advanced provides, to the extent required by applicable Laws, an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such

Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a
claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after

rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance

policies with respect to any actual or alleged error, misstatement,
misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or any matter
claimed against a director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by reason of his or her serving in such capacity that existed or
occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If the Company
and the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six
(6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies

or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
set forth in this _Section 4.10_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 4.10_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. Parent shall
pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be
incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations under this _Section 4.10_. The obligations under this
_Section 4.10_ shall not be terminated or modified without the consent of
such affected Indemnified Parties.

the Company to that effect (stating with reasonable specificity which
Required Information the Company has not delivered); (ii) the conditions set
forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ and in _Annex A_ have been satisfied (other than
_clause (a)_ and _clause (c)(vi)_ of _Annex A_ and those conditions that by

to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing was to be scheduled for any time
during such ten (10) consecutive business day period; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced if, prior to

case the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to commence unless and until,

restatement has been completed and the relevant financial statement has been
amended or the Company has indicated that it has concluded that no restatement
shall be required in accordance with GAAP; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Marketing Period shall end on any earlier date that is the date on which
Parent or Merger Sub actually receives cash or proceeds of the Financing in an
amount equal to at least an amount sufficient to fund the payment of the cash
consideration under this Agreement (including the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable hereunder) and the repayment of the Subject Indebtedness
and to pay the related fees and expenses on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, if the Marketing Period has not ended prior

solely for purposes of this clause, "50%" shall be substituted for "15%" in
the definition of "Acquisition Proposal") then, in each of cases (i), (ii),
(iii) and (iv), the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee (less any
amount previously paid by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section
6.5(d)_), by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately
available funds (1) in the case of clause (i) of this _Section 6.5(b)_, prior
to or concurrently with such termination, (2) in the case of clause (ii) of
this _Section 6.5(b)_, within two (2) business days after such termination,
(3) in the case of clause (iii) of this _Section 6.5(b)_, prior to or
concurrently with such termination, and (4) in the case of clause (iv) of this
_Section 6.5(b)_, upon the earlier of entering into such definitive agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal. " _ _Termination Fee__ "
shall mean a cash amount equal to $102,861,000. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather
are liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in
the circumstances in which such Termination Fee is due and payable, for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled
to the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, in no event shall Parent be
entitled to receive both the full amount of the Termination Fee and any cash
payment pursuant to _Sections 6.5(c)_ or _(d)_ , and in no event shall Parent
be entitled to both the cash payments pursuant to  _Sections 6.5(c)_ and
_(d)_.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.4(b)_,
then the Company shall pay to Parent a cash amount equal to $54,137,000 in
respect of the fees and

 



64  expenses incurred by Parent or its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, including in respect of
(i) all fees and expenses of accountants, counsel, investment banking firms
or financial advisors (and their respective counsel and representatives),
experts and consultants to Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all fees and
expenses payable to banks, investment banking firms and other financial
institutions (and their respective counsel and representatives) in connection
with arranging or providing financing for the Per Share Merger
Consideration or any of the other Transactions, and costs and expenses
otherwise allocated to Parent pursuant to _Section 4.10_. The payment
contemplated by this _Section 6.5(c)_ shall not limit or relieve the Company
of any liability or damages to Parent in respect of or arising out of a
breach of this Agreement by the Company in excess of the payment contemplated
by this _Section 6.5(c)_.

 

(d) If the conditions to the Offer described in clauses (b), (c)(i) and
(c)(ii) of Annex A have been satisfied and this Agreement is terminated by
either Parent pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ or the Company pursuant to
_Section 6.2(a)_ and Parent was entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 6.2(a)_ and at the time of termination the Minimum Condition had
not been satisfied, then the Company shall pay to Parent a cash amount equal
to $5,000,000 in respect of the fees and expenses incurred by Parent or its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, including in respect of (i) all fees and
expenses of accountants, counsel, investment banking firms or financial
advisors (and their respective counsel and representatives), experts and
consultants to Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) all fees and
expenses payable to banks, investment banking firms and other financial
institutions (and their respective counsel and representatives) in connection
with arranging or providing financing for the Offer Price and the Per Share
Merger Consideration or any of the other Transactions, and costs and expenses
otherwise allocated to Parent pursuant to _Section 4.9_.

 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
6.3(b)_, then Parent shall pay to the Company a cash amount equal to
$54,137,000 in respect of the fees and expenses incurred by the Company or its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein, including in respect of all fees and expenses of accountants,
counsel, investment banking firms or financial advisors (and their respective
counsel and representatives), experts and consultants to Parent or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, and costs and expenses otherwise allocated to the Company pursuant to
_Section 4.9_. The payment contemplated by this _Section 6.5(d)_ shall not
limit or relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any liability or damages to the
Company in respect of or arising out of a breach of this Agreement by Parent
or Merger Sub in excess of the payment contemplated by this _Section 6.5(d)_.

 

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in _Section 6.5(b)_- _(e)_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay
in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to  _Section 6.5(b)_- _(e)_ ,
then (i) the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall reimburse the other for
all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount and (ii) the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the

 



65  other interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_  in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made plus 2%.

claim the same, and (vi) agrees that it shall not bring any action arising out
of, in connection with or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions in
any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any action or
proceeding in such court as provided above shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

67  Affiliates involved in any such financing, and their Affiliates respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives involved in any

7.6 _Specific Performance_. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable
harm would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or in the event of
any actual or threatened breach of this Agreement, and that money damages
would not be an adequate remedy, even if available. It is accordingly
agreed that, except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with _Article VI_ , the parties (on behalf of themselves and the third-party
beneficiaries of this Agreement provided in _Section 7.9_) shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable
relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and any other agreement
or instrument executed in connection herewith. The parties hereby further
acknowledge and agree that such relief shall include (x) the right of the
Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions, in each
case, if each of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ have been
satisfied or waived (other than conditions which by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions at the Closing) and (y) the right of Parent and Merger Sub
to cause the Company to consummate the Transactions if each of the conditions
set forth in _Section 5.1_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
conditions which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those conditions at the Closing). The
parties further agree that (a) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
_Section 7.6_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any
other form of relief, at law or in equity, that may be available to a party
under this Agreement, including monetary damages in the event that this
Agreement is terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in
this  _Section 7.6_ are not available or otherwise are not granted and (b)
nothing contained in this _Section 7.6_ shall require any party to institute
any action or proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute
any action or proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section 7.6_
before exercising any termination right under _Article VI_ (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any action
or proceeding pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ or anything contained in this
_Section 7.6_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of _Article VI_ or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and/or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party
has an adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby acknowledges and agrees (i) that it hereby irrevocably waives
any requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with
such relief and (ii) that the prevailing party in any such action or
proceeding shall be entitled to reimbursement of all costs and expenses
associated with seeking such relief, including all attorneys fees. If on the
date of any termination of this Agreement, there is a pending Action

 



68  that has been brought by a party hereto seeking the remedies provided for in
this _Section 7.6_, then, without further action, such termination date shall
be automatically extended until the date that is five (5) business days after
the dismissal, settlement or entry of final order with respect to such Action.

(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), (b) following the
Effective Time, the right of former stockholders of the Company to obtain the
Per Share Merger Consideration to which they are entitled under the provisions

and the Company hereby agree that their respective representations, warranties
and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the

Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon
any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
_Section 7.9_, the Financing Sources are hereby made third-
party beneficiaries of _Section 7.5(c) and 7.16_. The third-party
beneficiary rights referenced in clause (c) of the second preceding sentence
may be exercised only by the Company (on behalf of its stockholders as their
agent) through actions expressly approved by the Company Board, and no
stockholder of the Company whether purporting to act in its capacity as a
stockholder or purporting to assert any right (derivatively or otherwise) on
behalf of the Company, shall have any right or ability to exercise or cause
the exercise of any such right. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto.

 

7.10 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary

an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



70 7.11 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_,
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such
similar Taxes imposed with respect to the Offer and the Merger shall be paid
by Parent and Merger Sub when due.

 

7.12 _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex B_ is defined in the
Section of this Agreement set forth opposite such term.

7.13 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If the
final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Entity declares any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof
to any Person or any circumstance, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the parties
will negotiate in good faith in order to substitute a suitable and equitable
provision therefor in order to carry out as closely as possible, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision, and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

 

7.14 _Interpretation; Construction_. (a) The table of contents and headings in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part
of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of
the provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a
Section or Annex, such reference shall be to a Section of or Annex to
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning as the word "shall." The term "or" is not
exclusive.

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring
or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Letter in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a Disclosure Letter to this Agreement shall not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement.

7.15 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of law
or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by written
notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect subsidiary in
lieu of Merger Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall
be deemed references to such other subsidiary, except that all (a)
representations and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger
Sub as of

 



71  the date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties
made with respect to such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation
and (b) covenants and agreements made in this Agreement with respect to
Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed covenants and
agreements made by such other subsidiary as of the date of such designation,
provided that no such designation shall impede or otherwise delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement is void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

7.16 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_. None of the Financing
Sources shall have any liability to the Company or its affiliates (other than
Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries))
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, including
the Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise,
and neither the Company nor any of its affiliates (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)) will have any
rights or claims against any Financing Sources under this Agreement and any
other agreement contemplated by, or entered into in connection with, the
Transactions, including any commitments by the Financing Sources in respect of
financing the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
in no event shall the Company or its affiliates (other than Parent and its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries)) be entitled to
seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against any of the
Financing Sources, nor shall the Parent or its affiliates have any obligation
to any Party to enforce any commitments, or other agreement, by any of the
Financing Sources in respect of the Financing.

as though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any
such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such earlier date); _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the condition set forth in
this _clause (c)(iii)(D)_ shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if any
representations and warranties of the Company are not so true and correct
unless the failure of such representations and warranties of the Company to be
so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects all
obligations required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior to
the Closing Date;

 

(v) since the date of this Agreement, there has occurred any Effect that has
had or would be reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(vi) the Marketing Period shall have failed to expire, _provided_ that the
Marketing Period shall be deemed to have expired (even if it has not started)
if (A) this condition has not been satisfied by the date that is six (6)
Business Days prior to the Outside Date (the " _Fallaway Date_ "), (B) the
failure of the Marketing Period to timely commence to satisfy this condition
is due solely to the failure of the condition set forth in _clause (b)_ of
this _Annex A_ to be satisfied within a timeframe that would have permitted
the Marketing Period to commence and end prior to the Fallaway Date and (C)
but for the failure of the condition set forth in _clause (b)_ of this _Annex
A_ to be timely satisfied, the Marketing Period would otherwise have started
by the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the Outside Date and been
continuing uninterrupted through the Outside Date; or

 

(vii) Merger Sub shall have failed to receive a certificate of the Company,
executed by the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer of the
Company, dated as of the Expiration Date, to the effect that the conditions
set forth in _clauses (c)(iii)_ , _(c)(iv)_ and _(c)(v)_ of this _Annex A_
have been satisfied.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms of this

 



A-2  Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and
Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub regardless of the
circumstances giving rise to any such conditions, and may be waived by Parent
or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their
sole and absolute discretion (except for the Minimum Condition), in each case,
subject to the terms of this Agreement and the applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied,
(x) Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to include or exclude for
purposes of their determination thereof Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant
to guaranteed delivery procedures and (y) the number of Shares outstanding on
a fully diluted basis shall be the number of Shares issued and outstanding
_plus_ the number of Shares which the Company would be required to issue
pursuant to any then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or
obligations or securities convertible or exchangeable into Shares, but only
to the extent so exercisable, convertible or exchangeable prior to
consummation of the Merger or exercisable, convertible or exchangeable as a
result of the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.
