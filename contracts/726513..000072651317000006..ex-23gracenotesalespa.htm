(i) Within forty-five (45) days after delivery to Seller of the Final Closing
Statement, Seller may deliver to Acquiror a written statement (the "Objection
Statement") advising Acquiror that Seller disputes Acquiror's calculations set
forth in the Final Closing Statement, which Objection Statement shall include,
in reasonable detail, the reasons for each item in dispute and proposed
adjustments to Acquiror's calculations set forth in the Final Closing
Statement. If Seller does not timely deliver an Objection Statement as
required above, then the calculation of the Final Total Share Purchase
Consideration as set forth in the Final Closing Statement shall be final and
binding on the parties and shall not be subject to further review, challenge
or adjustment.

(ii) If Seller timely delivers an Objection Statement pursuant to Section
2.3(c)(i) above, Acquiror and Seller shall confer in good faith to attempt to
resolve any disagreements between the Final Closing Statement and the
Objection Statement. If Acquiror and Seller are unable to resolve such
disagreements within forty five (45) days after the date of the Objection
Statement, then such disagreements shall be referred to Grant Thornton or
another recognized firm of independent certified public accountants selected
by mutual agreement of Acquiror and Seller (the "Settlement Accountants"). The
Settlement Accountants shall determine only the disputed amounts based solely
on materials presented by Seller and Acquiror and not by independent review,
and in no event shall the Settlement Accountants' calculation of any disputed
amount be (x) less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either Seller or
Acquiror, or (y) greater than the greater of the amount claimed by either
Seller or Acquiror. The determinations of the Settlement Accountants with
respect to the Final Total Share Purchase Consideration shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall be final and
binding on the parties and shall not be subject to further review absent fraud
or manifest error. The Settlement Accountants shall use their best efforts to
reach a determination not more than forty five (45) days after such referral.

(iii) Each party shall pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Section 2.3. Acquiror and Seller shall bear the fees and expenses of
the Settlement Accountants based upon the inverse proportion of the dollar
amount of the disputed items resolved in favor of such party (i.e., so that
the prevailing party bears a lesser amount of such fees and expenses).

(iv) In the event that any Cash included in the Final Closing Cash or any
Trapped Cash is held in an account of Seller or one of its Affiliates (other
than an Entity in the Company Group), Seller shall promptly pay such amount to
Acquiror by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

(d) Post-Closing Payments.



(i) If the Final Total Share Purchase Consideration as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.3(c) is less than the Estimated Total Share Purchase
Consideration, Seller shall deliver to Acquiror the amount of such difference
no later than five (5) Business Days after the determination of such Final
Total Share Purchase Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available
funds.

(ii) If the Final Total Share Purchase Consideration as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.3(c) is greater than the Estimated Total Share Purchase
Consideration, Acquiror shall deliver to Seller the amount of such difference
no later than five (5) Business Days after the determination of such Final
Total Share Purchase Consideration.

(iii) The procedures set forth in this Section 2.3 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Persons for any Damages in respect of the
calculation of the Final Total Share Purchase Consideration, including the
Final Closing Cash, Final Closing Debt, Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses and
Final Closing Working Capital (and Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment
Amount).

(e) Withholding. Acquiror is permitted to withhold amounts payable hereunder
as required under applicable Law, and such amounts withheld will be treated
for all purposes hereof as paid to the Person with respect to which the
withholding was made, provided that if any such withholding with respect to a
payment under this Agreement is required by Netherlands Law (or the Law of any
political subdivision of the Netherlands), Acquiror shall increase the amount
of such payment by an amount necessary such that Seller receives the amount it
would have received, after taking into account all available credits and
deductions, had no such deduction or withholding been required. For the
avoidance of doubt, the preceding sentence shall not apply to any Netherlands
non-resident capital tax that could apply to the sale of Gracenote Netherlands
Holdings B.V. Acquiror and Seller shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by
the other party, to reduce the amount of withholding Taxes imposed on any
payments due hereunder, including by executing and filing any forms or
certificates reasonably required to claim an available reduced rate of, or
exemption from, withholding Taxes and by promptly providing any relevant
information reasonably requested by the other party. Acquiror represents that,
except as otherwise required by a change in United States Law after the date
hereof, Acquiror has no knowledge of any required United States deduction or
withholding with respect to payments on the Closing Date in respect of Shares,
assuming the receipt of (A) a valid, properly completed and duly executed IRS
Form W-9 for Seller, indicating that backup withholding is not required under
U.S. tax law, and (B) the certificate required to be delivered pursuant to
Section 6.8.

(f) Purchase Price Allocation. During the time period from the Agreement Date
until the Closing, the Parties will cooperate in good faith to prepare a
mutually agreed allocation of the Estimated Total Share Purchase Consideration
among the shares, or, as applicable, membership interests, of each of the
Companies.

(g) The parties shall abide by the covenants and agreements set forth in
Section 2.3(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If a Triggering Event occurs,
then Seller shall pay to Acquiror, under the circumstances and subject to the
limitations specified in Section 2.3(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, an
amount not to exceed Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars ($15,000,000). Any such
payment shall be deemed an adjustment to the Purchase Price hereunder.

that would require the Company Group to disclose, dedicate to the public

public domain, or distribute, free of charge, the proprietary source code
comprising or including any of the Company Products or Company Owned IP
Rights.

will cause, any of the following functions: (i) disrupting, disabling, harming
or otherwise impeding in any manner the operation of, or providing

ordinary course of business or loans properly issued under subsections (A) or
(C) of this definition) and (C) a plan, policy, program fund or arrangement
which provide insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements that
are clearly identified as such, and any stop-loss insurance policies issued in
connection with such self-insured arrangements), workers' compensation
benefits, vacation benefits, severance benefits, termination indemnity,
redundancy pay, retention, disability benefits, death benefits,
hospitalization benefits, medical benefits, dental benefits, vision care
benefits, cafeteria benefits, child/dependent care benefits, sabbatical,
retirement benefits, thirteenth month pay, incentive compensation, deferred
compensation, profit-sharing or bonuses or equity or equity-based awards; in
each case regardless of whether it is mandated under local Law, voluntary,
private, funded, unfunded, financed by the purchase of insurance, contributory
or noncontributory; provided that any governmental plan or program requiring
the mandatory payment of social insurance taxes or similar contributions to a
governmental fund with respect to the wages of an employee will not be
considered a Seller Benefit Arrangement. The term "Company Benefit
Arrangement" shall be limited to mean a Seller Benefit Arrangement that is
available exclusively for the benefit or participation of current or former
employees and service providers of the Company Group. For clarity, the term
"Seller Benefit Arrangements" includes the Company Benefit Arrangements.



(ii) Each Seller Benefit Arrangement in which employees of the Company Group
have participated has been maintained in compliance in all material respects
with its terms and Applicable Laws, and no event has occurred and no condition
exists with respect to any Such Seller Benefit Arrangement that would be
reasonably expected to give rise to any material liability under Applicable
Laws to any Entity in the Company Group. Unless otherwise indicated in
Schedule 3.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each Company Benefit
Arrangement and Seller Benefit Arrangement that is an "employee pension
benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA that is intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code (A) has received a favorable opinion,
advisory, notification and/or determination letter, as applicable, that such
plan satisfied the requirements of all current Applicable Laws (a copy of
which letter(s) have been delivered to Acquiror and its counsel), and to the
knowledge of the Companies, nothing has occurred since the issuance of such
opinion, advisory, notification and/or determination letter, as applicable,
which could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of the tax-qualified
status of such Company Benefit Arrangement or Seller Benefit Arrangement, (B)
is subject to an application to the Internal Revenue Service for such letter
or has a remaining period of time to apply for such letter or (C), relies on a
favorable Internal Revenue Service opinion letter or advisory letter issued to
the master and prototype or volume submitter plan sponsor of such employee
pension benefit plan in accordance with Internal Revenue Service guidance for
reliance on such opinion or advisory letters. Each other Seller Benefit
Arrangement that is intended to qualify for Tax-preferential treatment under
applicable Law so qualifies and since the Lookback Date has received, where
required, approval from the applicable Governmental Authority that it is so
qualified and, to the knowledge of the Companies, no event has occurred or
circumstance exists that may give rise to disqualification or loss of Tax-
preferential treatment.

(iii) Seller has delivered to Acquiror a correct and complete copy of each
material written Company Benefit Arrangement and Seller Benefit Arrangement,
including all plan documents, adoption agreements, and amendments and
restatements thereto as currently in effect, trust documents, financial
statements, insurance policies (including any stop-loss insurance policies
pertaining to a self-insured Company Benefit Arrangement or Seller Benefit
Arrangement), and summary plan descriptions, relating thereto.

(iv) No Action has been brought, or to the knowledge of the Companies, is
threatened against or with respect to any Company Benefit Arrangement in
respect of current or former employees of the Companies, including any audit
or material inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service or the U.S. Department of
Labor.

(v) Other than as provided in Schedule 3.14(c)(v), no Company Benefit
Arrangement or Seller Benefit Arrangement (other than life insurance
arrangements providing benefits for individuals who die while actively
employed with the Company Group or Seller, as applicable) provides post-
termination or retiree welfare benefits to any current or former employee of
the Companies for any reason, except as may be required by COBRA or other
Applicable Law.

(d) No Entity in the Company Group has any Company Benefit Arrangement which
constitutes, or has since the enactment of ERISA, constituted, (i) a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" as defined in ERISA or Code Section 413(c), (iii) a "funded
welfare plan" within the meaning of Code Section 419 or (iv) any "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA).
No Company Benefit Arrangement is or has ever been subject to Title IV of
ERISA. Other than as provided in Schedule 3.14(c), (x) no Seller Benefit
Arrangement is a defined benefit pension plan or other arrangement that
provides benefits on a defined benefit basis in the event of retirement,
termination or redundancy; and (y) no Seller Benefit Arrangement



that is a retirement or deferred compensation plan or plan set forth on
Schedule 3.14(c)(v) maintained, sponsored or contributed to by any Entity in
the Company Group has any unfunded liability in excess of assets held for such
Seller Benefit Arrangement. There does not exist any material liability under
(A) Title IV of ERISA, (B) Section 302 of ERISA, (C) Code Sections 412, 430
and 4971, or (D) Code Section 4980B, in each case, that would be a liability
of any Entity in the Company Group following the Closing, in each case, as a
result of being an ERISA Affiliate of Seller prior to the Closing. No Entity
in the Company Group has any material liability for Taxes under Code Section
4980H.

(e) Unless otherwise indicated in Schedule 3.14(e) of the Company Disclosure
Letter, the Company Group is not a party to any: (i) Contract with any current
or former employee of the Companies with a value in excess of $100,000 the
benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are materially
altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving the Company Group in
the nature of the Share Purchase or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement; or (ii) Company Benefit
Arrangement or Seller Benefit Arrangement, any of the benefits of which shall
be increased, or the vesting of benefits of which shall be accelerated, by the
occurrence of the Share Purchase or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or any event subsequent to the Share Purchase such as the
termination of employment or services of any Person, or the value of any of
the benefits of which shall be calculated on the basis of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as a result of any actions
taken by Acquiror or the Company Group after Closing, no Company Group member
has made or has become obligated to make, and no Company Group member will as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement become obligated to make, any payments that would be nondeductible
by any member of the Company Group by reason of Code Section 280G (without
regard to subsection (b)(4) thereof). No Company Group member is required to
"gross up" or otherwise compensate any current or former employee because of
the imposition of any Tax under Code Section 4999 or Code Section 409A on any
compensatory payment to the individual.

(f) In the past two (2) years, there has been no "mass layoff," "employment
loss," or "plant closing" as defined by the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN Act") in respect of the Company Group or any WARN-
type event as defined by Applicable Law.

(g) The representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.7 and this
Section 3.14 are the sole representations and warranties relating to ERISA,
labor, employment and employee benefits matters and no other representations
or warranties contained in this Agreement shall be construed to cover any
matter involving ERISA, labor, employment and employee benefits matters.

3.15 No Brokers. No Entity in the Company Group is obligated for the payment
of any fees or expenses of any investment banker, broker, finder or similar
party in connection with the origin, negotiation or execution of this
Agreement or in connection with the Share Purchase or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement (other than fees and expenses which constitute
Transaction Expenses of the Company Group for which Seller will be responsible
pursuant to Section 13.7). Acquiror shall not incur any liability or other
obligation, either directly or indirectly, to any such investment banker,
broker, finder or similar party as a result of this Agreement or the Share
Purchase.

3.16 Insurance. As of the Agreement Date, Seller and the non-U.S. Entities of
the Company Group maintain the policies of insurance and bonds listed in
Schedule 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Schedule 3.16 sets forth the
name of the insurer under each such policy and bond, the type of policy or
bond, the coverage amount, any applicable deductible as of the Agreement Date
and indicates if the policy is part of a consolidated insurance program of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Consolidated
Insurance Program"). As of the Agreement Date, there is no material claim
pending under



any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has been questioned, denied
or disputed by the underwriters of such policies or bonds. All premiums due
and payable under all such policies and bonds have been timely paid, and the
Company Group is otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such
policies and bonds. Seller has delivered to Acquiror correct and complete
copies of all such policies of insurance (or descriptions or summaries of such
policies, if the policies have not yet been received by Seller) and bonds
issued at the request or for the benefit of the Company Group other than such
policies and bonds that are part of, or issued in respect of, the Seller
Consolidated Insurance Program. Coverage under all policies which are part of
the Seller Consolidated Insurance Program will cease as of the Closing Date.

of access to such document (or portion thereof) or information would
reasonably be expected to conflict with Applicable Laws and (iii) neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates or its other Representatives shall have any
obligation to provide Acquiror or its Representatives

ARTICLE 7

ACQUIROR COVENANTS

With respect to the covenants set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 7.7,
during the time period from the Agreement Date until the earlier to occur of
(a) the Closing or (b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
the provisions of Article 11 and with respect to the covenants set forth in
Sections 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 from and after the Closing, Acquiror
covenants and agrees with the Companies and Seller as follows:

7.1 Advice of Changes. Acquiror shall promptly advise the Companies and Seller
in writing of (a) any event occurring subsequent to the Agreement Date that
would render any representation or warranty of Acquiror contained in Article 5
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 9.1 would
not be satisfied, (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Acquiror
pursuant to this Agreement or any Acquiror Ancillary Agreement such that the
condition set forth in Section 9.2 would not be satisfied or (c) any change,
event, circumstance, condition or effect that would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the other conditions set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that that Acquiror's failure to give notice under this
Section 7.1 shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this Section
7.1 but instead shall constitute only a breach of the underlying
representation or warranty or covenant, as the case may be.

7.2 Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent. Acquiror shall use its reasonable
best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions
precedent set forth in Article 9, and Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Share Purchase and the other transactions contemplated by

Agreement.

7.3 Employee Benefit Matters.

(a) As of the Closing, each Entity in the Company Group shall terminate its
participation in each Seller Benefit Arrangement (other than the Company
Benefit Arrangements) and in no event shall any Continuing Employee be
entitled to accrue any benefits under any such Seller Benefit Arrangement as
to which the participation of the Company Group or its current or former
employees is terminated with



respect to services rendered or compensation paid on or after the Closing. To
the extent required by Applicable Law or the terms of a Seller Benefit
Arrangement, Seller shall be responsible for notifying in writing each person
employed by the Company Group at the Closing of the termination of his or her
participation in any such Seller Benefit Arrangement, including, without
limitation, any required written notice to participants in the Tribune Company
401(k) Savings Plan of their roll-over rights in connection with the Closing.
Seller shall cause such termination to occur as soon as administratively
practicable and no later than the Closing Date, unless such termination is
prohibited or required to be delayed by Applicable Law or contractual
obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates, including the Company Group,
with respect to any such Seller Benefit Arrangements. Effective as of Closing,
Seller shall cause all Continuing Employees to become fully vested in their
accrued benefit or account under the Seller 401(k) savings plan set forth in
Schedule 7.3(a).

(b) A Person who is an employee of any Entity in the Company Group immediately
prior to the Closing and who remains an employee of any Entity in the Company
Group or becomes an employee of Acquiror following the Closing shall be a
"Continuing Employee"; provided, however, that no Legacy LTD Employee shall be
a Continuing Employee until and unless such Legacy LTD Employee returns to
active employee status and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer, effective as of no later than the Closing, the employment of each
Legacy LTD Employee to an Entity not in the Company Group. Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to transfer, effective as of no later than the
Closing, the employment of each individuals listed on Schedule 7.3(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter to an Entity in the Company Group, and each such
person shall be considered a Continuing Employee for purposes of this
Agreement. For a period of at least twelve (12) months immediately following
the Closing, Acquiror shall (x) except as provided in Section 7.3(d), provide
to all Continuing Employees a salary or wage level and target bonus
opportunity substantially similar to the salary or wage level and target bonus
opportunity applicable to employees of Acquiror who are similarly situated
based on levels of responsibility and (y) allow the Continuing Employees to
enroll or participate in Acquiror's employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements, including its retirement plans, medical plan, dental plan,
life insurance plan and disability plan, bonus plans, equity incentive plans,
severance benefits and other benefits arrangements, on substantially similar
terms applicable to employees of Acquiror who are similarly situated based on
levels of responsibility. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall take
such action, or shall cause the appropriate Entity in the Company Group to
take such action, as necessary to terminate the employment of each of the
individuals listed on Section 1.1 of the Company Disclosure Letter effective
no later than immediately prior to the Closing.

(c) Acquiror shall, effective as of the Closing, provide (or cause its
Affiliate to provide) to each Continuing Employee who holds unvested Seller
equity awards immediately prior to the Closing, (1) awards of Acquiror equity
or equity of its Affiliate representing publicly-traded common stock of
Acquiror or its Affiliate ("Acquiror Common Stock"), or (2) awards based on
Acquiror Common Stock which settle only in cash, or (3) a cash payment at or
promptly after (but in any event no later than 30 days after) the Closing in
lieu of (1) or (2), or (4) any combination of (1), (2) or (3) having, in the
aggregate, comparable value to such Continuing Employee's unvested Seller
equity awards as in effect immediately prior to the Closing (the "Acquiror
Closing Grants"), provided that any Acquiror Closing Grants made with respect
to an unvested Seller equity award that is an option shall be made in a manner
that avoids adverse tax consequences under Code Section 409A. If a Continuing
Employee is a party to one of the letter agreements set forth in Schedule
7.3(c) (each a "Letter Grant Employee"), the Letter Grant Employee will
receive Acquiror Closing Grants that satisfy all terms and conditions required
by Section 2(a) of such letter agreement for New Awards (as defined therein).
Without limiting the foregoing, at grant, each Acquiror Closing Grant shall
have a value as determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in
Schedule 7.3(c). Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Seller
will provide Acquiror with all information regarding the



Continuing Employees reasonably required to comply with its obligations under
this Section 7.3(c), including a list of all such Continuing Employees, the
amounts of unvested equity awards held by each such Continuing Employee and
the vesting schedule therefor. No later than four (4) Business Days prior to
the Closing, Acquiror shall deliver to Seller written evidence of the approval
by Acquiror's board of directors of the grant of all Acquiror Closing Grants
to Letter Grant Employees, with individual detail by each such Letter Grant
Employee of all Acquiror Closing Grants to such person. No later than four (4)
Business Days following the first scheduled meeting of the Acquiror's board of
directors following the Closing, Acquiror shall deliver to Seller written
evidence of the approval by Acquiror's board of directors of the grant of all
Acquiror Closing Grants other than those granted to Letter Grant Employees,
with individual detail by each such Continuing Employee of all Acquiror
Closing Grants to such person.

(d) Without limiting, and notwithstanding, anything herein to the contrary,
Acquiror shall, and shall cause the Entities in the Company Group to, on and
after the Closing, honor all rights and obligations in respect of current and
former employees of the Company Group arising from termination of their
employment, if any, under the severance plans and agreements listed on
Schedule 7.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

(e) To the extent not paid prior to the Closing, any bonuses or commissions
payable to any employee of the Company Group or the individuals listed on
Schedule 7.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter that have been accrued on the
books and records of any Entity in the Company Group or Seller or its other
Affiliates in respect of any fiscal year of the Company Group ending on or
prior to the Closing Date or for the fiscal year of such Entity or Seller, as
applicable, that includes the Closing Date shall be paid by the Company Group
(or by Seller or its other Subsidiaries) in the ordinary course of business in
accordance with the terms of the applicable bonus or commission plan.

(f) Effective as of, and following, the Closing, Acquiror and its Subsidiaries
shall, or shall cause the Entities in the Company Group to, provide credit for
each Continuing Employee's length of service with the Companies (including any
length of service with any Entity in the Company Group) for all purposes
(including eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under each employee
benefit plan, program, policy and arrangement, including retirement plans,
medical plans, dental plans, life insurance plans and disability plans, bonus
plans, severance benefits, and other bonus or benefit arrangements (the
"Acquiror Plans") of Acquiror, except that such prior service credit will not
be required (i) with respect to accrued benefits under any defined benefit
pension plan or (ii) to the extent that it results in a duplication of
benefits.

(g) Effective as of, and following, the Closing, to the extent permitted or
required by Applicable Law, and to the extent Seller can provide Acquiror with
all the requisite information, Acquiror and its Subsidiaries shall, or shall
cause the Entities in the Company Group to, cause any Acquiror Plan in which
any Continuing Employee participates that is a health or welfare benefit plan
(collectively, "Acquiror Welfare Plans") to, if applicable, (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, requirements for insurability,
exclusions and service conditions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to Continuing Employees (and their eligible
dependents), (ii) honor any payments, charges and expenses of such Continuing
Employees (and their eligible dependents) that were applied toward the
deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the corresponding Company Benefit
Arrangement in satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums
or co-payments under a corresponding Acquiror Welfare Plan during the same
plan year in which such payments, charges and expenses were made, and (iii)
with respect to any medical plan, waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Continuing Employee following the Closing. In addition, to the extent that any
Continuing Employee has begun a course of treatment with a physician or other
service provider who is considered "in network" under a Company Benefit
Arrangement and such course of treatment



is not completed prior to the Closing, Acquiror will use commercially
reasonable efforts to arrange for transition care, whereby such Continuing
Employee may complete the applicable course of treatment with the pre-Closing
physician or other service provider at "in network" rates. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, transition care described in the preceding sentence shall be
limited to care related the following conditions determined as of the Closing
Date or such later date as may be provided for in the Transition Services
Agreement (the "Transition Date"): (i) pregnancies in the second or third
trimester, (ii) high-risk pregnancies, (iii) premature infants born before the
Transition Date, (iv) infertility treatments, (v) bariatric surgery scheduled
to occur on or after the Transition Date, (vi) cancer, with ongoing
treatments, (vii) hospice care, (viii) any recent or acute medical conditions
such as spinal cord injuries, cerebral vascular accidents, or traumatic brain
injuries, (ix) occupational, speech, and physical therapy, (x) any inpatient
or ambulatory surgical procedure scheduled to occur on or after Transition
date, that the Seller Benefit Arrangement has already pre-certified, and (xi)
mental health and/or substance abuse disorders.

(h) Seller shall be responsible for administering compliance with the health
care continuation requirements of COBRA with respect to all employees or
former employees of an Entity in the Company Group and their covered
dependents who incur a COBRA qualifying event at any time prior to the Closing
Date and be liable for all such costs to the extent not already included in
the calculation of Closing Working Capital. On or after the Closing Date,
Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries shall be responsible for administering
compliance with the health care continuation requirements of COBRA with
respect to all Continuing Employees and their covered dependents and be liable
for all such costs.

(i) Subject to Applicable Law, following the Closing Date Seller shall
continue to provide long-term disability benefits (but not medical benefits)
under a Seller Benefit Arrangement (for so long as Seller is required to
provided such disability coverage under the terms of the applicable Seller
Benefit Arrangement) to any Person who is a current or former employee of any
Entity in the Company Group who received long-term disability benefits
immediately prior to the Closing Date as a result of an event that occurred
prior to the Closing Date (the "Legacy LTD Employees"). With respect to any
Continuing Employee who received short-term disability benefits immediately
prior to the Closing Date and who becomes eligible to receive long-term
disability benefits as a result of the same disability following the Closing
Date (the "New LTD Employees"), following the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide such New LTD Employee with long-term disability benefits (but not
medical benefits) under a Seller Benefit Arrangement.

(j) On or after the Closing Date, Acquiror or one of its Affiliates shall
provide short-term disability benefits to all eligible Continuing Employees
under an Acquiror Plan in accordance with Section 7.3(b). Prior to the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide short-term disability benefits under a Seller
Benefit Arrangement to all eligible employees of the Company Group.

(k) This Section 7.3 shall not operate to (a) duplicate any benefit provided
to any Continuing Employee or to fund any such benefit, (b) be construed to
mean the employment of the Continuing Employees is not terminable by Acquiror
or the Company Group at will at any time, with or without cause, for any
reason or no reason (other than as may be set forth in an employment agreement
with the Continuing Employee), or (c) amend any ERISA plan or create any third
party rights of causes of action for any person (including any employee
representative, union, or labor organization).

7.4 Indemnification of Company Group Directors and Officers.

(a) If the Share Purchase is consummated, then until the sixth anniversary of
the Closing, Acquiror shall cause each Entity in the Company Group, or its
successors to, fulfill and honor in



all respects the obligations of such Entity to its current and former
directors and officers or equivalent position holders (the "Company
Indemnified Parties") pursuant to (i) any indemnification, exculpation or
expense advancement provisions under the organizational documents of such
Entity, (ii) any indemnification agreements between any Entity in the Company
Group and such Company Indemnified Parties or (iii) any purchase agreement
entered into by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
acquisition of any Entity or business in the Company Group, in each case, as
in effect on the date of this Agreement or with respect to (i) and (ii), to
the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, if greater, with respect to
claims arising out of matters, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Closing (regardless of whether any proceeding relating to any Company
Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification, exculpation or expense
advancement with respect to any such matters, acts or omissions is commenced
before or after the Closing). Any claims for indemnification made under this
Section 7.4(a) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing shall
survive such anniversary until the final resolution thereof.

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Acquiror, on behalf of itself and each Entity
in the Company Group, and each of their respective successors and assigns,
releases and forever discharges each Company Indemnified Party who is not a
Continuing Employee from any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
judgments, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), fines and
settlements in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring on or prior
to the Closing Date whether asserted or commenced prior to, on or after the
Closing Date.

(c) The provisions of this Section 7.4 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties (or their heirs,
personal representatives, successors or assigns) against Acquiror and its
successors and assigns. Acquiror shall cause the applicable Entity in the
Company Group or its successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any Company Indemnified Party (or his
or her heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns) in any legal
action brought by such person that is successful to enforce the obligations of
Acquiror, such Entity or its successors under this Section 7.4. The
obligations of Acquiror, the Company Group and its successors under this
Section 7.4 shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in such a
manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party (or his or her
heirs, personal representatives, successors or assigns) without the prior
written consent of such Company Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs,
personal representatives, successors or assigns, as applicable). In the event
Acquiror (or any of its successors or assigns) (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or
surviving company or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be,
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.4.

7.5 Insurance. Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing Date, the Company Group and the assets of the Company Group shall
cease to be insured by any insurance policies or any self-insured programs of
Seller or its Affiliates, other than foreign insurance policies placed by
non-U.S. Entities of the Company Group, which are not part of the Seller
Consolidated Insurance Program. For a period of six (6) years following the
Closing Date, Acquiror shall maintain, or shall cause the surviving company to
maintain, in effect a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy
covering the Company Indemnified Parties; provided, that this Section 7.5
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if a prepaid policy or policies (i.e.,
"tail coverage") have been obtained for the benefit of such Entity in the
Company Group, which policy or policies provide such Company Indemnified
Parties with the coverage for an aggregate period of not less than six (6)
years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or



before the Closing Date, including with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and with terms and conditions that are no less
favorable than the directors' and officers' liability insurance that currently
covers the Company Indemnified Parties, with a Side A, B and C coverage limit
of no less than Thirty-Five Million Dollars ($35,000,000) and a Side A
Difference in Condition and Excess coverage limit of no less than Fifteen
Million Dollars ($15,000,000). The premiums for such prepaid policies shall be
paid in full by Acquiror at or prior to the Closing Date and such prepaid
policies shall be non-cancelable.

7.6 Access to Information.

(a) Following the Closing, Acquiror and the Company Group shall (i) allow
Seller and its agents and advisors reasonable access to the personnel,
properties, books and records of the Company Group as reasonably requested by
Seller and to the extent needed in connection with the preparation of the
financial statements of Seller or its Affiliates after the Closing or as
otherwise needed in connection with Seller's compliance with any Applicable
Law and (ii) provide reasonable cooperation in connection with the litigation
matters listed on Schedule 7.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Seller Matters"), including providing Seller with access at reasonable times
to the personnel, properties, books and records of the Company Group to the
extent related to the Seller Matters; provided, that the foregoing shall be
done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of Acquiror or the Company Group and at Seller's expense.

(b) Following the Closing, Seller and its applicable Affiliates shall (i)
allow Acquiror and its agents and advisors reasonable access to the personnel,
properties, books and records of Seller and its applicable Affiliates as
reasonably requested by Acquiror and to the extent needed in connection with
the preparation of the financial statements of Acquiror or its Affiliates
after the Closing or as otherwise needed in connection with Acquiror's
compliance with any Applicable Law and (ii) provide reasonable cooperation in
connection with all litigation matters of the Company Group (the "Company
Group Matters"), including providing Acquiror with access at reasonable times
to the personnel, properties, books and records of Seller and its applicable
Affiliates to the extent related to the Company Group Matters; provided, that
the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably
with the conduct of the business of Seller or its Affiliates and at Acquiror's
expense.

7.7 Credit Support Obligations.

(a) Acquiror shall use its reasonable best efforts, both before and following
the Closing, to assume or replace the letters of credit, performance bonds,
corporate guarantees and other similar items issued and outstanding relating
to the Business or assets of the Company Group, including as set forth on
Schedule 7.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Support Obligations"),
such that Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company Group) shall,
following the Closing, no longer have any continuing obligations or liability
thereunder. If Acquiror has not assumed or replaced any of the Support
Obligations prior to the Closing, Acquiror shall (a) backstop such Support
Obligations, (b) indemnify Seller and its Affiliates against any losses
arising after the Closing with respect to such Support Obligations, (c)
reimburse Seller and its Affiliates for any and all reasonable expenses
incurred by them that are attributable to continuing such Support Obligations
after the Closing and (d) not, and shall cause the Company Group to not, seek
or enter into any extension, amendment or modification of such Support
Obligations (including any extension, amendment or modification of any
agreement relating to such Support Obligations) without Seller's prior written
consent.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall use its reasonable best
efforts prior to Closing to obtain and deliver evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller (the "Guaranty Release") that



Seller is no longer a guarantor of the Real Property Lease set forth on
Section 7.7 of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Guaranteed Lease"). If
Acquiror has not obtained the Guaranty Release prior to the Closing, at the
Closing Acquiror will enter into an agreement with Seller (the "Backstop
Guaranty"), which agreement will include the unconditional and irrevocable
obligations of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 7.7(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. In addition to the obligations set forth on
Section 7.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Backstop Guaranty shall
include such other terms and conditions as are reasonably satisfactory to
Seller and Acquiror consistent with the purpose and intent thereof. The
Backstop Guarantee will be terminated upon the earlier of the expiration of
the current term (without modification, amendment or extension) of the
Guaranteed Lease and the date on which Seller is no longer a guarantor of the
Guaranteed Lease.

7.8 Retained Trademark Run-Off Rights.

(a) At the Closing, Acquiror shall cause appropriate filings to be executed
and made with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to change the
names of Tribune Digital Ventures, LLC, Tribune International Holdco, LLC and
Tribune Media Services, LLC to names that do not include any Tribune Names and
Marks.

(b) Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cease use of the
Tribune Names and Marks on or as promptly as possible following the Closing
Date but, in any event, all such use shall cease on the date that is three (3)
months after the Closing Date. Seller hereby grants Acquiror the limited right
and license to use the Tribune Names and Marks for such period solely in
connection with the Business and solely to the extent to which, and in the
manner in which, such Tribune Names and Marks were used in the Business as of
the Closing Date.

Entity in the Company Group) arising under principles of transferee or
successor liability or by contract as a result of activities or transactions
taking place at or prior to the Closing and (iv) Taxes for which the Seller is
responsible under Section 8.1(j), in each of the above cases, to the extent
such Taxes exceed the accrual in respect thereof shown on the Final Closing

liability for Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion
beginning on the day after the Closing Date (v) in the case of real and
personal property Taxes, by apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis and
(vi) in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of a closing of the books as
of the end of the Closing Date, provided that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis shall be apportioned on a

excluding Taxes for which Seller is responsible under Section 8.1(a).

(c) Refunds; Post-Closing Date Losses. Acquiror and Seller shall each be
entitled to receive and retain any refund or other reimbursement or credit in
respect of Taxes (including interest actually received thereon from a relevant
taxing authority) for which such party is responsible under Section 8.1(a),
8.1(b) or 8.1(g), as the case may be, and Acquiror and Seller, as the case may
be, shall promptly notify the other party of the receipt of any refund or
other reimbursement or credit to which the other party is entitled hereunder
and pay over such refund or other reimbursement or the amount of such credit.
Neither Acquiror nor any Entity in the Company Group shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Tax Law, carry back to a Pre-Closing Tax Period any
item of loss, deduction or credit or any net operating loss, net capital loss
or other tax credit or benefit that is attributable to, arises from or relates

(5) business days prior to the date on which the relevant Taxes are required
to be paid to the applicable Tax Authority.

8.1 shall survive until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations or other limitation period (taking into
account any applicable extension). The representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.6 (Taxes) and the covenants or agreements for Tax matters
contained in this Agreement shall survive until thirty (30) days following the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations or other limitation period
(taking into account any applicable extension).

(g) Tax Returns.

(i) Seller shall be responsible for preparing and filing all Tax Returns (A)
of the Company Group that are due (taking into account extensions) on or prior
to the Closing Date or (B) that are Consolidated or Combined Returns;
provided, however, that if any such Tax Return described in clause (i)(A)
hereof relates to a Tax for which Acquiror is responsible under Section
8.1(b), not later than twenty days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return by Seller, Seller shall provide Acquiror with a copy of such Tax Return
for Acquiror's approval.

(ii) Acquiror shall be responsible for preparing and filing all other Tax
Returns relating to the business or assets of the Company Group; provided,
however, that in the case of any such Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or a Straddle Period, not later than twenty days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return by Acquiror, Acquiror shall provide Seller
with a copy of relevant portions



of the draft of such Tax Return for Seller's approval, and unless prohibited
by applicable Tax Law, such Tax Return shall be prepared and filed in a manner
that is consistent with the past practice of the Company Group.

(iii) Without the prior written consent of Seller, Acquiror shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Affiliates to, amend any Tax Returns or make or
change any Tax elections or accounting methods, in each case with respect to
any Entity in the Company Group relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period, except to the extent required by applicable Tax Law.

(iv) In the event of any disagreement between Acquiror and Seller regarding
any Tax Return furnished to the other for approval under Section 8.1(d)(i) or
8.1(d)(ii) that cannot be resolved by the fifteenth day prior to the due date
for such Tax Return, such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm
of international reputation mutually agreeable to Acquiror and Seller (the
"Tax Accountant"), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be
final. The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by
Acquiror and Seller. If the Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences
between Acquiror and Seller with respect to such Tax Return at least five days
prior to the due date therefor, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by
the party having the responsibility hereunder for filing such Tax Return and
amended to reflect the Tax Accountant's resolution.

(h) Tax Contests.

(i) Acquiror or Seller, as the case may be, shall notify the other party
within twenty days after receipt by such party or any of its Affiliates of
written notice of any pending federal, state, local or foreign Tax audit or
examination or notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination relating to Taxes for which such other party or its Affiliates
may be responsible under Section 8.1(a), 8.1(b) or 8.1(g) ("Tax Matters").

(ii) With respect to any Tax Matters relating to Taxes of any Entity in the
Company Group for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Acquiror under
Section 8.1(a), Seller may choose in its sole discretion to control, contest,
resolve and defend against (at its expense) such Tax Matter (including
selection of counsel); provided that with respect to any such Tax Matter,
Seller shall keep Acquiror informed of all developments on a timely basis
(including by sending copies of all material correspondence to Acquiror) and
shall not agree to settle or resolve any such Tax Matter (other than a Tax
Matter relating to Consolidated Income Tax Liabilities or any Consolidated or
Combined Return, which Seller may settle or resolve in its sole discretion)
without Acquiror's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(iii) Subject to Section 8.1(h)(iv), Acquiror shall have the sole right (at
its own expense) to control all Tax Matters of any Entity in the Company Group
not controlled by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1(h)(ii).

(iv) Acquiror shall not, and shall not permit its Affiliates to, concede,
settle or compromise a Tax Matter (or portion thereof) controlled by Acquiror
under Section 8.1(h)(iii) to the extent such concession, settlement or
compromise could result in a payment from Seller to Acquiror pursuant to
Section 8.1(a) of this Agreement, without the consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(i) Books and Records; Cooperation. Acquiror and Seller shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) (i) provide the other party and its Affiliates
with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other examination by any





taxing authority or any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to
Taxes and (ii) retain (and provide the other party and its Affiliates with
reasonable access to) all records or information which may be relevant to such
Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding; provided, that the foregoing
shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the business of the parties.

(j) Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including any real property transfer tax and
any similar Tax) ("Transfer Taxes") shall be borne equally by Seller and
Acquiror. The party responsible for payment of Transfer Taxes under applicable
Law shall pay such Transfer Taxes when due and, at their own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes
and fees. The applicable party making payment shall submit a receipt of the
applicable Transfer Tax for reimbursement within ten (10) days. If required by
applicable Law, Seller or Acquiror will, and will cause their Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.
Acquiror and Seller shall cooperate, as reasonably requested by the other
party, to reduce the amount of Transfer Taxes, including by executing and
filing any forms or certificates reasonably required to claim an available
reduced rate of, or exemption from, Transfer Taxes and by promptly providing
any relevant information reasonably requested by the other party.

(k) No Section 338 Elections. Except as provided in this Section 8.1(k), no
elections will be made under Section 338(g) or 338(h)(10) of the Code (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state or local law) with respect to the
Share Purchase. Seller shall consider in good faith any request by Acquiror to
make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any Entity
in the Company Group that is organized outside of the United States, and shall
not unreasonably withhold its consent to such election, provided, that, and
without limitation, it shall be reasonable for Seller to withhold such consent
unless (i) Acquiror agrees to reimburse and hold harmless (on an after-Tax
basis) Seller and its Affiliates for any Taxes and other incremental costs
resulting from such election and (ii) the amount described in the preceding
clause (k)(i) can be readily determined by Seller without material cost or
unreasonable burden. No Entity in the Company Group will make any other
elections on or after the Closing Date that would have the effect of
increasing taxable income or Taxes of the Company Group for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

(l) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, indemnification for any
and all Tax matters and the procedures with respect thereto shall be governed
exclusively by this Section 8.1 and shall not be governed by the provisions of
Article 12 (other than Section 12.3).

8.2 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

(a) Acquiror shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become
necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its
obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Acquiror Ancillary Agreements;
(ii) cooperate fully with Seller and the Companies in promptly seeking to
obtain all such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals; and (iii)
provide such other information to any Governmental Authority as such
Governmental Authority may reasonably request in connection herewith. Each
party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, make as
promptly as practicable, and in no event, no later than five (5) Business Days
following the date hereof, its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Authorities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each



party hereto agrees to, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, make as
promptly as practicable, and in no event, no later than five (5) Business Days
following the date hereof, its respective filings and notifications, if any,
under any other applicable antitrust, competition, or trade regulation
Applicable Law and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the applicable antitrust, competition, or
trade regulation Applicable Law. Acquiror shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, pay all fees or make other payments required by Applicable Law
to any Governmental Authority in order to obtain any such authorizations,
consents, orders or approvals.

(b) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any
communication it or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the
matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority. Neither of the parties to this Agreement shall agree to participate
in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings,
investigation (including any settlement of an investigation), or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Each party hereto
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to, coordinate and cooperate fully with the other party hereto
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in
seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under
the HSR Act. The parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and their respective Representatives to, provide each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between
them or any of their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and incorporate the other parties' reasonable comments thereon; provided,
however, that materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning
the valuation of the Company Group; (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements or Applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns. No
party to this Agreement shall extend any waiting period or comparable period
under the HSR Act or other under any other applicable antitrust, competition,
or trade regulation Applicable Law or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority not to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.

(c) Acquiror shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, enter into any
transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction (including any merger
or acquisition) that might reasonably be expected to make it more difficult,
or to increase the time required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act, or any other applicable antitrust,
competition, or trade regulation Applicable Law, applicable to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that would
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 8.2, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible. Notwithstanding



the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, Seller and the Company
Group shall not, without Acquiror's prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture transaction or agree to any restriction on the Business, and
nothing in this Section 8.2 shall (i) limit any applicable rights a party may
have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 11 so long as such party
has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 8.2, (ii) require Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to offer,
accept or agree to (A) dispose, sell or hold separate any part of its or the
Company Group's operations, assets or business (or a combination of Acquiror's
and its Affiliates' and the Company Group's respective operations, assets or
businesses), (B) not compete in any geographic area or line of business,
and/or (C) restrict the manner in which Acquiror, the Company, or any of their
Affiliates may carry on business in any part of the world or (iii) require any
party to this Agreement to contest or otherwise resist any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding by (1) a Governmental Authority or (2) any
proceeding by a private party beyond (x) the use of commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution of, any permanent,
preliminary or temporary injunction or other order that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) pursuing a motion to dismiss or similar
action with respect to such private party challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and in each case taking any necessary related actions in
connection therewith.

(e) Acquiror shall provide all reasonably requested cooperation in connection
with Seller's works council consultation obligations described in Section 10.5
of the Company Disclosure Letter. Nothing in this Section 8.2(e) shall
obligate or be construed to obligate Acquiror or any of its Affiliates to
make, or to cause to be made, any payment to any third party in relation to
the works council cooperation offered by Acquiror to Seller as described in
the immediately preceding sentence.

8.3 Shared Contracts. Upon Acquiror's request, with respect to those contracts
that are identified on Schedule 8.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter between
or among Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than any Entity in the Company
Group, except in the event an Entity in the Company Group is a party to a
contract together with Seller or any of its other Affiliates) and any third
party under which the Company Group receives benefits that are material to the
Business (the "Shared Contracts"), the parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) if permissible, assign to Acquiror or its designee
(including the Company Group) that portion of the benefits and obligations
under such Shared Contract as they relate to the Company Group or (b) cause
the counterparty to each such Shared Contract to enter into a new contract
with Acquiror or its designee (including the Company Group), on terms
substantially similar to those contained in such Shared Contract, in order for
the Company Group to receive the applicable benefits under such Shared
Contract (each such new contract, a "New Contract"). If, prior to the Closing,
such assignment is not permissible and if Acquiror is not able to obtain a New
Contract with respect to a counterparty to any such Shared Contract, then, for
a period of six months after the Closing Date, the parties shall continue to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such counterparty to
authorize such assignment or to enter into a New Contract or, if mutually
agreed between the parties, Seller shall provide the benefits and obligations
of such Shared Contract as they relate to the Company Group pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement for the periods specified therein. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Seller or any member of the Company
Group be required to pay any consideration in connection with its obligations
under this Section 8.3 or, unless requested to do so by Acquiror at Acquiror's
sole cost and expense, to commence, defend or participate in any litigation in
connection therewith or to offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any third party in connection therewith.

8.4 No Use of Seller Retained Names. On and after the Closing Date, and except
as set forth in Section 7.8 none of Acquiror or its Affiliates (including the
Company Group following the Closing), shall use the "Tribune" or "Tribune
Media" names, marks, domain names or logos (the "Retained Names") or any name
confusingly similar thereto (or any derivations therefrom in any language)
alone or together with



other words, logos, slogans, symbols or designs in any form, variation or
manner in connection with any business that Acquiror or its Affiliates
(including the Company Group following the Closing) may thereafter conduct.

8.5 Further Assurances.

(a) Seller shall, at any time and from time to time after the Closing, upon
the request and at the expense of Acquiror but without further consideration,
do, execute, acknowledge, deliver and file, or shall cause to be done,
executed, acknowledged, delivered and filed, all such further acts, deeds,
transfers, conveyances, assignments or assurances as may be reasonably
required by Acquiror for transferring, conveying, assigning and reducing to
Acquiror's possession and use, the Shares and the assets and properties of the
Business. In addition, if a party or one of its Affiliates receives after the
Closing Date any funds properly belonging to the other party, the recipient
will promptly so advise the other party, and will promptly deliver such funds
to the other party.

(b) If, following the Closing, any Entity in the Company Group requires the
right to use any Intellectual Property owned by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than any Entity in the Company Group) that was used by the
Company Group in connection with the operation of the Business prior to the
Closing (the "Retained IP"), then Seller shall, or shall cause such
Affiliates, to grant to Acquiror or one of its Affiliates a non-exclusive,
world-wide, fully paid, royalty-free, fully transferable and non-cancelable
license and right to use such Retained IP for all purposes in connection with
the creation, marketing, sale and licensing of the Company Group's products
and services. If, following the Closing, Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than any Entity in the Company Group) requires the right to use any
Intellectual Property owned by any Entity in the Company Group (or that was so
owned at Closing and is then owned by Acquiror or Affiliates thereof) that was
used in connection with the operation of the business of Seller or its
Affiliates other than the Business as of the date hereof (the "Company Group
IP"), then Acquiror shall, or shall cause such Entity, to grant to Seller or
one of its Affiliates a non-exclusive, world-wide, fully paid, royalty-free,
fully transferable and non-cancelable license and right to use such Company
Group IP for all purposes in connection with the creation, marketing, sale and
licensing of Seller's or such Affiliate's products and services and in a
manner which does not compete with the products and services sold by any
Entity in the Company Group as of the Closing Date or with respect to the
products and services set forth on Annex A of the Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreement, planned to be sold as of the Closing Date.

8.6 Negotiation of Agreements. Prior to the Closing, the parties shall
negotiate with each other and agree in good faith on the terms of the
Transition Services Agreement and Reverse Transition Services Agreement.

ARTICLE 9

each of the following conditions (it being understood that any one or more of
the following conditions may be waived by Seller in a writing signed on behalf

such specified date or dates), and at the Closing the Companies and Seller

effect executed by an officer of Acquiror.

11.1 Termination by Mutual Consent. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing by the mutual written consent of Acquiror, Seller
and the Companies.

11.2 Unilateral Termination.

(a) Either Acquiror on the one hand, or Seller and the Companies on the other
hand, by giving written notice to the other, may terminate this Agreement if a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority shall have
issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting the Share Purchase or any other material transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Either Acquiror on the one hand, or Seller and the Companies on the other
hand, by giving written notice to the other, may terminate this Agreement if
the Share Purchase shall not have been consummated by midnight Eastern Time on
June 19, 2017 (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.2(b) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of a representation or warranty or
covenant made under this Agreement by such party results in the failure of any
condition precedent set forth in Article 9 or Article 10 to be fulfilled or
satisfied on or before such Termination Date.

(c) Either Acquiror on the one hand, or Seller and the Companies on the other
hand may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Closing if (i) the
other has committed a breach of (A) any of its representations and warranties
under Article 3, Article 4 or Article 5, as applicable or (B) any of its
covenants under Article 6, Article 7 or Article 8, as applicable, and has not
cured such breach within fifteen (15) Business Days after the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement has given the other party written notice of such
breach and its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.2(c) (provided, however, that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be cured and if such
cure period would expire after the Termination Date, the Termination Date
shall be automatically extended, without any action by any party, to the date
on which such cure period expires) and (ii) such breach, if not cured on or
prior to the Closing Date, would result in the failure of any of the
conditions set forth in Article 9 or Article 10, as applicable, to be
fulfilled or satisfied.



(d) Seller and the Companies, by giving written notice to Acquiror, may
terminate this Agreement at any time, in their sole discretion, if a
Governmental Authority shall have asserted any claim in any court, agency or
other proceeding seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise
prohibit consummation of such transactions, and Acquiror has not confirmed in
writing its intent to use commercially reasonable efforts to contest such
claim within five (5) Business Days of a written request for such confirmation
from Seller and abided by such undertaking.

provided in Section 11.2, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror, Seller or the
Companies, their Affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors or
stockholders; provided, however, that (i) the provisions of this Section 11.3
(Effect of Termination) and Article 13 (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement, (ii) nothing
herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability in connection with any
willful breach of any of such party's representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein, and (iii) if Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.2(d), Acquiror shall have no liability to Seller for failing or
refusing to use commercially reasonable efforts to contest such claim.

ARTICLE 12

SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, INDEMNIFICATION AND REMEDIES

12.1 Survival. If the Share Purchase is consummated, the representations and
warranties of Seller and the Companies contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the date that is twelve (12) months following the Closing
Date; provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties contained
in Section 3.1 (Company Group; Capitalization), Section 3.2 (Power,
Authorization and Validity), Sections 4.2 (Power, Authorization and Validity)
and Section 4.4 (Title) (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") will
remain operative and in full force and effect indefinitely, (ii) the ERISA
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.14(d) until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations relating to the subject
matter of such representation or warranty plus sixty (60) days and (iii) the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.6 (Taxes) shall survive
and expire as provided in Section 8.1(f); provided further, that no right to
indemnification pursuant to Article 12 in respect of any claim based upon any
failure of a representation or warranty that is set forth in a Notice of Claim
(as defined below) delivered prior to the expiration of the applicable Claims
Period (as defined in Section 12.4(b)) with respect to such representation or
warranty shall be affected by the expiration of such representation or
warranty. If the Share Purchase is consummated, all covenants of the parties
contained in this Agreement (including the covenants set forth in Article 6,
Article 7 and Article 8) required to be performed or complied with prior the
Closing (each, a "Pre-Closing Covenant") shall survive the Closing and remain
in full force and effect until the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, and all other covenants of the parties contained in this
Agreement, as well as Pre-Closing Covenants to the extent they contemplate
performance following the Closing (each, a "Post-Closing Covenant") shall
survive the Closing until fully performed; provided, however, that no right to
indemnification pursuant to Article 12 in respect of any claim based upon any
breach of a covenant that is set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered prior to
the expiration of the Claims Period with respect to such covenant shall be
affected by the expiration of such covenant. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Section 8.1(f) shall govern the survival and expiration of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.6 (Taxes) and any Covenants with respect
to Taxes.

12.2 Agreement to Indemnify.

(a) From and after Closing, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Acquiror
and its Affiliates (including the Company Group) and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives



(each hereinafter referred to individually as an "Acquiror Indemnified Person"
and collectively as "Acquiror Indemnified Persons") from and against any and
all damages, losses, costs, penalties and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees, other professionals' and experts' fees, costs of
investigation and court costs (including such fees and costs incurred in
connection with enforcing the provisions of this Article 12)) (hereinafter
collectively referred to as "Damages"), arising out of or resulting from the
following (the "Indemnifiable Matters"): (i) any breach or failure to be true
and correct or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by Seller or
the Companies in this Agreement; (ii) any breach of or default in connection
with any of the covenants or agreements made by Seller or the Companies in
this Agreement; (iii) Taxes that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to
Section 8.1; (iv) the ownership and operation of Seller's and its Affiliates'
(other than the Company Group) businesses prior to, at and after the Closing,
including, without limitation, all liabilities under any Seller Benefit Plans
(excluding Company Benefit Plans), (v) all Company Debt and Transaction
Expenses to the extent not included in the calculations set forth in Section
2.3 hereof and (vi) the matters set forth on Section 12.2(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

(b) From and after Closing, Acquiror shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates (excluding the Company Group) and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (each hereinafter
referred to individual as a "Seller Indemnified Person" and collectively as
"Seller Indemnified Persons") from and against any and all Damages arising out
of or resulting from the following: (i) any breach or failure to be true and
correct of any representation or warranty made by Acquiror in this Agreement;
or (ii) any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or
agreements made by Acquiror in this Agreement.

12.3 Limitations.

(a) No Acquiror Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification in
respect of any claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to Section
12.2(a)(i) (and does not involve a Fundamental Representation) unless and
until (i) the amount of Damages that have finally been determined to be
indemnifiable pursuant to Section 12.2(a)(i) in connection with any individual
claim or series of related claims based on a similar set of operative facts is
greater than $100,000 (the "De Minimis Threshold") and once the De Minimis
Threshold has been exceeded, the Acquiror Indemnified Person may be
indemnified for all Damages related thereto and not just the amount in excess
of the De Minimis Threshold (the "Non De Minimis Damages"), but subject to any
remaining amount of the Deductible and (ii) the aggregate amount of Non De
Minimis Damages that have finally been determined to be indemnifiable pursuant
to Section 12.2(a)(i) exceeds Five Million Six-Hundred Thousand Dollars
($5,600,000) (the "Deductible"), and once the Deductible has been reached, the
Acquiror Indemnified Person may be indemnified for all Non De Minimis Damages
in excess of the Deductible.

(b) The maximum amount recoverable by the Acquiror Indemnified Persons from
Seller for Damages in respect of claims for indemnification under Section
12.2(a)(i) shall be Two Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars ($2,800,000)
(the "Indemnification Limit"), which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
against Seller, and any Damages in respect of claims for indemnification under
Section 12.2(a)(i) in excess of the Indemnification Limit shall solely be
recoverable through the RandW Policy. The maximum amount recoverable by the
Acquiror Indemnified Persons from Seller for Damages in respect of claims for
indemnification under Sections 8.1 and 12.2(a) (other than any claim with
respect to Taxes described in Section 8.1(a)(iii)) shall be the Final Total
Share Purchase Consideration, which shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
against Seller.

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, Damages shall be calculated net of actual
recoveries under insurance policies and contractual indemnification or
contribution provisions (in each case calculated



net of any actual collection costs and reserves, deductibles, premium
adjustments and retrospectively rated premiums); provided, that, in the event
that an indemnified persons recovers from a party hereunder for any particular
Damages and thereafter recover for the same Damages pursuant to any insurance
policies and/or contractual indemnification or contribution provisions, then
the amount recovered pursuant to such insurance policies and/or contractual
indemnification or contribution provisions (after deducting therefrom the
amount of actual collection costs incurred by it and up to the amount first
recovered from the other party in respect of such claim) shall be paid to such
party by the indemnified party.

(d) Damages shall exclude special, incidental, indirect, exemplary or punitive
Damages, and except resulting from any Third Party Claim, consequential
Damages. No indemnified person shall be entitled to double recovery for any
indemnifiable Damages even though such Damages may have resulted from the
breach of more than one of the representations, warranties and covenants, or
any other indemnity, in this Agreement. If and solely to the extent that an
amount of Damages in connection with an Indemnifiable Matter was already
specifically taken into account in connection with calculation of the Closing
Cash, Closing Debt or Final Total Share Purchase Consideration, the same
amount of such Damages may not be recovered under this Article 12. Costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, other professionals' and
experts' fees, costs of investigation and court costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses) incurred by any Acquiror Indemnified Person in investigating,
preparing or defending any applicable Third-Party Claim shall constitute
indemnifiable Damages if and solely to the extent that such Third-Party Claim
arises out of or results from an Indemnifiable Matter.

(e) In determining the amount of the payment necessary to indemnify any party
against, or reimburse any party for, Damages, the amount of the Damages shall
be determined net of any Tax benefit actually realized by the Acquiror
Indemnified Person (or any Affiliate thereof) as the result of sustaining or
paying such Damages (including as the result of facts or circumstances due to
which the Indemnified Party sustained or paid such Damages).

(f) Following the Closing, and other than with respect to claims for actual
fraud or claims for equitable remedies, specific performance or injunction
relief, (i) Section 8.1 and this Article 12 shall constitute the sole and
exclusive remedy for recovery of Damages by the Acquiror Indemnified Persons
for all Indemnifiable Matters or otherwise in respect of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) all applicable statutes of
limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims for Indemnifiable
Matters shall be shortened to the applicable claims periods and survival
periods expressly set forth herein and (iii) subject to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article 12, the Acquiror Indemnified Persons
irrevocably waive, from and after the Closing Date, any and all rights they
may have to make claims against Seller or any of its Affiliates (excluding the
Company Group), or their respective officers, directors, employees,
Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents, representatives, successors or
assigns, in each case, under statutory and common law as a result of any
Damages incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Persons with respect to the
Indemnifiable Matters or otherwise in respect of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby whether or not in excess of the maximum
amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this Article 12.

(g) For purposes of determining the amount of Damages recoverable by an
indemnified Person under this Article 12 with respect to an indemnity claim
regarding a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, and for
purposes of determining whether or not any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty has occurred, all representations and warranties of
the Companies in Article 3, all representations and warranties of the Seller
in Article 4 and all representations and warranties of the Acquiror in Article
5 shall be construed as if the terms "material" and "in all material respects"
and any reference to "Material Adverse Effect" (and variations thereof) were
omitted from such representations and



warranties; provided, that the definition of Material Contracts shall not be
modified by the foregoing for any purpose hereunder.

(h) Following the Closing, and other than with respect to claims for actual
fraud or claims for specific performance or injunctive relief, (i) Section 8.1
and this Article 12 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for
recovery of Damages by the Seller Indemnified Persons for all Indemnifiable
Matters or otherwise in respect of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) all applicable statutes of limitations or other
claims periods with respect to claims for Indemnifiable Matters shall be
shortened to the applicable claims periods and survival periods expressly set
forth herein and (iii) subject to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article 12, the Seller Indemnified Persons irrevocably waive, from and
after the Closing Date, any and all rights they may have to make claims
against Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers,
directors, employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents,
representatives, successors or assigns, in each case, under statutory and
common law as a result of any Damages incurred by the Seller Indemnified
Persons with respect to the Indemnifiable Matters or otherwise in respect of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby whether or not in
excess of the maximum amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this
Article 12.

(i) Tax Indemnity. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
indemnification for any and all Tax matters and the procedures with respect
thereto shall be governed exclusively by Section 8.1 and shall not be governed
by the provisions of this Article 12 (other than Section 12.3).

12.4 Notice of Claim.

(a) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification by any
Person entitled to indemnification under this Article 12 (each, an
"Indemnified Person"). Acquiror or Seller shall give written notice of a Claim
(a "Notice of Claim") to the Person or Persons liable for such Claim (each, an
"Indemnitor") promptly after Acquiror or Seller, as applicable, becomes aware
of the existence of any actual or potential claim for indemnification under
this Article 12, arising out of or resulting from (i) any matter indemnifiable
under Section 12.2 or (ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing,
against any Indemnified Person of a claim, demand or Action brought by a third
party against such Indemnified Person (in each such case, a "Third-Party
Claim") that is based on, arises out of or relates to any matter indemnifiable
under Section 12.2.

(b) The period during which claims may be initiated (the "Claims Period") for
indemnification for Damages arising out of or resulting from the Indemnifiable
Matters shall commence at the Closing and terminate at the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in Section 12.1.

(c) Each Notice of Claim by Acquiror or Seller given pursuant to this Section
12.4 shall contain the following information:

(1) that the Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, sustained or accrued, or
reasonably anticipates that it will incur, pay, sustain or accrue, Damages in
an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim, and if not then
definitively known, a reasonable estimate thereof, (which amount may be the
amount of Damages claimed by a third party in an action brought against any
Indemnified Person based on alleged facts, which if true, would give rise to
liability for Damages to such Indemnified Person under this Article 12); and





(2) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Acquiror or Seller), of the facts, circumstances or events giving
rise to such Damages based on Acquiror's or Seller's good faith belief
thereof, including (x) the basis for such anticipated liability and the nature
of the breach to which such Damages are related, (y) the identity of any third
party claimant and (z) copies of any formal demand or complaint from any third
party claimant.

(d) No delay on the part of Acquiror or Seller in giving Indemnitor a Notice
of Claim shall relieve Indemnitor from any of its obligations under this
Article 12 unless (and then only to the extent that) Indemnitor is materially
prejudiced thereby.

12.5 Defense of Third-Party Claims. Any Third-Party Claim shall be subject to
the following procedures:

(a) Defense by Indemnitor. Indemnitor will have the right to assume the
defense of such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense with reputable
legal counsel of its choosing by delivering written notice of such election to
the Indemnified Person within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the
Notice of Claim describing such Third-Party Claim. If Indemnitor assumes the
defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with this subsection (a), then:

(i) Indemnitor shall keep the Indemnified Person informed of all material
developments relating to such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnified Person shall
have the right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications
with respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such
documents does not waive any privilege.

(ii) The Indemnified Person may retain separate co-counsel and participate in
the defense of such Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect
to such Third-Party Claim at its own cost and expense, but shall not be
entitled to determine or conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim or
settlement negotiations with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

(iii) Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (1) such judgment,
settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release from all liability
with respect to the claim in favor of the Indemnified Person or (2) the sole
relief provided in connection with such judgment, settlement or compromise is
monetary damages that are paid in full by Indemnitor or any other relief that
is enforceable only against Indemnitor.

(iv) The insurer under the RandW Policy and its agents and advisors shall be
permitted to associate effectively with the parties hereto in the defense of
any matter which might reasonably constitute a Loss (as defined in the RandW
Policy).

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indemnitor shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim (unless the
Indemnified Person agrees otherwise in writing) in the event:

(i) the Third-Party Claim involves an injunction or other equitable relief; or

(ii) outside legal counsel to the Indemnified Person reasonably determines
that the legal counsel chosen by Indemnitor has a conflict of interest in
representing the interests of the Indemnified Person (including because the
Indemnified Person may have available to it one or more defenses or



counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the Indemnitor in respect of a Third-Party Claim).

(c) Defense by Indemnified Person. In the event that Acquiror or Seller gives
Indemnitor a Notice of Claim and Indemnitor does not thereafter promptly
assume or declines to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim or is not
entitled to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim according to Section
12.5(b) above, then the Indemnified Person will have the right to assume and
control the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel of its choosing
(which reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel shall constitute Damages
to which Indemnitor is responsible if the Claim underlying such Third-Party
Claim is a Claim for which the Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification hereunder). If the Indemnified Person assumes the defense of
the Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section 12.5(c), then:

(i) The Indemnified Person shall keep Indemnitor informed of all material
developments relating to such Third-Party Claim. Indemnitor shall have the
right to receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with
respect to such Third-Party Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents
does not waive any privilege.

(ii) Indemnitor may retain separate co-counsel and participate in the defense
of such Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect to such
Third-Party Claim at its own cost and expense, but shall not be entitled to
determine or conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim or settlement
negotiations with respect to such Third-Party Claim.

(iii) The Indemnified Person shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise of such Third-Party Claim without the
prior written consent of Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), unless (1) such judgment, settlement or
compromise includes an unconditional release from all liability with respect
to the claim in favor of the Indemnified Person or (2) the Indemnified Person
stipulates in writing that there are no Damages for which it is entitled to
indemnification under this Article 12 in connection with such judgment,
settlement or compromise.

(d) Cooperation. Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person shall use reasonable
best efforts to cooperate (and cause their respective legal counsel to
cooperate) in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including
by (i) furnishing copies of documents, records or other information reasonably
requested by the other party and (ii) providing access to employees whose
assistance, testimony or presence is reasonably necessary to assist in the
evaluation and defense of such Third-Party Claim (provided that any such
access shall not unreasonably interfere with the business activities of either
party).

12.6 Resolution of Notice of Claim. Each Notice of Claim given by an
Indemnified Person shall be resolved as follows:

(a) Uncontested Claims. If, within forty-five (45) days after a Notice of
Claim is received by Indemnitor, Indemnitor does not contest such Notice of
Claim in writing as provided in Section 12.6(b), Indemnitor shall be
conclusively deemed to have consented to the recovery by the Indemnified
Person of the full amount of Damages specified in the Notice of Claim in
accordance with this Article 12.

(b) Contested Claims. If Indemnitor gives Acquiror or Seller, as applicable,
or the Indemnified Person written notice contesting all or any portion of a
Notice of Claim (a "Contested Claim")



within the 45-day period specified in Section 12.6(a), then such Contested
Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement agreement executed
by Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person or (ii) in the absence of such a
written settlement agreement within forty-five (45) days following receipt by
the Indemnified Person of the written notice from Indemnitor, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Person and Indemnitor, by binding
litigation between Indemnitor and the Indemnified Person in accordance with
the terms and provisions of Section 12.6(c).

(c) Litigation of Contested Claims. Either the Indemnified Person or
Indemnitor may bring suit in the courts of the State of Delaware and the
Federal courts of the United States of America located within New Castle
County in the State of Delaware, and appellate courts therefrom, to resolve
the Contested Claim. Judgment upon any award rendered by such courts may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction.

(d) Access to Information. Indemnitor shall have reasonable access to
information about the Indemnified Person and, in the case of Seller, to
information about the Company Group and its successors and assigns (if any)
and the reasonable assistance of such Indemnified Person's and, in the case of
Seller, the Company Group's officers and employees for purposes of
administering Claims and exercising its rights hereunder; provided, that,
Indemnitor shall treat confidentially and not use or disclose any nonpublic
information from or about the Indemnified Person and, as applicable, the
Company Group or its successors and assigns (if any) to anyone (except to
Indemnitor's Affiliates, employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors
or authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case who agree
to treat such information confidentially); provided, however, that (i) neither
the Indemnified Person nor the Company Group shall be obligated to provide
such access or information if it determines, in its reasonable judgment, that
doing so would jeopardize the protection of attorney-client privilege and (ii)
in the event of any litigated dispute between the parties, the rules of
discovery shall apply.

12.7 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Seller and Acquiror agree to treat
(and cause their Affiliates to treat) any payment received pursuant to this
Article 12 as adjustments to the Total Share Purchase Consideration for all
Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law.

ARTICLE 13

MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Governing Law. The internal laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective
of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the validity of this
Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of first, the Court of
Chancery within New Castle County in the State of Delaware (and any appellate
court thereof located within such county) and to the extent such Court of
Chancery (or appellate court thereof) lacks jurisdiction over the matter, the
Federal courts of the United States of America located within New Castle
County in the State of Delaware (or appellate court thereof) solely in respect
of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and
of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including resolution of disputes
under Section 12.6(c)), and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a
defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said
courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement
or any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal
court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute



and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 13.8 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding,
venue shall lie solely in New Castle County, Delaware.

13.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Acquiror, including any
successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Acquiror and Acquiror may assign its right to purchase any of the
Shares at the Closing to one or more of its Affiliates; provided that Acquiror
shall remain liable for each of its obligations hereunder. Except as set forth
in the preceding sentence, no party hereto may assign any of its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties
hereto. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any
assignment in violation of this provision shall be void.

13.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

13.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures
of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.

13.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by
law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude the
exercise of any other. Each party hereto agrees not to raise any objection to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to enforce
compliance with the covenants and obligations of Acquiror under this Agreement
and hereby waives any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. No party
hereto shall be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with seeking an order to specifically enforce this Agreement. However,
notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Closing, Section 12.3(i) shall
exclusively control regarding remedies under this Agreement for Indemnifiable
Matters. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof without proof of damages or
otherwise in the Delaware Court of Chancery or the United States District
Court for the District of the State of Delaware. In addition to and not in
lieu of the foregoing, Seller has the right to cause Acquiror to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other transaction
documents on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and
therein.

13.6 Amendments and Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The
waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default. At any time prior to the Closing, each of



Seller, the Companies and Acquiror, by action taken by their respective board
of directors (or equivalent governing bodies), may, to the extent legally
allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties made to it contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for
its benefit contained herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective
unless signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is
asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to
enforce such provisions.

13.7 Expenses. Whether or not the Share Purchase is consummated, all
Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the party incurring such expense,
provided that if the Share Purchase is consummated all Transaction Expenses of
the Company Group shall be paid by Seller. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Acquiror shall be solely responsible for all costs
and expenses associated with or payable in connection with obtaining and
pursuing coverage under the RandW Policy.

13.8 Notices. All notices and other communications required or permitted under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile, or sent by nationally recognized express courier
service. In addition, each party shall send an email copy of such notice at
the email addresses set forth below but such email shall not constitute notice
for purposes of this Agreement. Such notices and other communications shall be
effective upon receipt if hand delivered or sent by facsimile and one day
after dispatch if sent by express courier, to the following addresses, or such
other addresses as any party may notify the other parties in accordance with
this Section 13.8:

agreement or document.

construed as creating a joint venture or partnership between any of the
parties hereto. No party is by virtue of this Agreement authorized as an

WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

13.17 Conflicts; Privilege. Recognizing that Debevoise and Plimpton LLP has
acted as legal counsel to the Company Group, certain of the direct and
indirect holders of the Companies' equity interests and certain of their
respective Affiliates prior to the date hereof, and that Debevoise and Plimpton
LLP intends to act as legal counsel to such direct and indirect holders of the
Companies' equity interests and their respective Affiliates (which will no
longer include the Company Group) after the Closing, each of Acquiror and the
Companies hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its respective
Affiliates and the other Entities in the Company Group to waive, any conflicts
that may arise in connection with Debevoise and Plimpton LLP representing any
such direct or indirect holders of the Companies' equity interests or their
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to the Company
Group or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between direct and indirect holders of
the Companies' equity interests, the Company Group and their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and Debevoise and Plimpton LLP, on the other hand,
in the course of the engagement with respect to negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be
attorney-client confidences that belong solely to such direct and indirect
holders of the Companies' equity interests and their respective Affiliates
(and not the Company Group). Accordingly, the Company Group shall not have
access to any such communications or to the files of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP
relating to such engagement from and after the Closing Date. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, from and after the Closing Date, (a) the
direct and indirect holders of the Companies' equity interests prior to the
Closing Date and their respective Affiliates (and not the Company Group) shall
be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such
engagement, and none of the Company Group shall be a holder thereof, (b) to
the extent that files of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP in respect of such
engagement constitute property of the client, only such direct and indirect
holders of the Companies' equity interests and their respective Affiliates
(and not the Company Group) shall hold such property rights and (c) Debevoise
and Plimpton LLP shall not have any duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any
such attorney-client communications or files to the Company Group by reason of
any attorney-client relationship between Debevoise and Plimpton LLP and any
Entity in the Company Group or otherwise. This Section 13.17 shall be
irrevocable, and no term of this Section 13.17 may be amended, waived or
modified, without the prior written consent of Debevoise and Plimpton LLP.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall restrict or
prevent Debevoise and Plimpton LLP from continuing to represent the Company
Group in matters unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and Acquiror hereby waives any conflict in connection therewith.

13.18 Foreign Currency Exchange. Where it is necessary to determine or specify
an amount in U.S. dollars where the underlying value of such amount is
expressed in or has been determined in a currency other than U.S. dollars,
then (i) to the extent necessary for purposes of required disclosures under
Articles 3, 4 or 5 foreign currency was converted to U.S. dollars at the
applicable Exchange Rate as of the date on which such conversion was made in
connection with the preparation of the applicable disclosure; (ii) with
respect to the calculation of the Estimated Closing Cash, Estimated Closing
Debt, Estimated Unpaid Transaction Expenses, Estimated Closing Working Capital
and Estimated Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount, the Seller will use
the applicable Exchange Rates for the date that is five (5) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, (iii) with respect to the calculation of the Final
Closing Cash, Final Closing Debt, Final Unpaid Transaction Expenses, Final
Closing Working Capital and Final Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount,
the Parties will use the applicable Exchange Rates for the Closing Date, and
(iv) with



respect to any Damages incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person in
accordance with Article 12, the parties will use the Exchange Rates for the
date which is two (2) Business Days prior to the date upon which final payment
to the Indemnified Person is to be made with respect to such Damages.
