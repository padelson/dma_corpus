Affiliates (including, in the case of Buyer, the Company) and its and their

available to the Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such personnel,
and such information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under
Section 2.05(c); provided, that no accountant of Seller or Buyer shall be
obligated to make any work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm
except in accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and

agreement relating to such access to work papers. In acting under this
Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not an
arbitrator.





(e) The process set forth in Section 2.04 and this Section 2.05 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of any of the parties and their respective
Affiliates for any disputes related to the amount of Closing Working Capital
and Closing Indebtedness, the Post-Closing Adjustment and the calculations and
amounts on which they are based or set forth in the related statements and
notices delivered in connection therewith. For the avoidance of doubt, the
calculations to be made pursuant to Section 2.04 and this Section 2.05 and the
Post-Closing Adjustment are not intended to be used to adjust for errors or
omissions that may be found with respect to the Financial Statements. After
the determination of the Final Closing Statement, neither party shall have the
right to make any claim based upon the preparation of the Final Closing
Statement or the calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing
Indebtedness (even if subsequent events or subsequently discovered facts would
have affected the determination of the Final Closing Statement or the
calculations of Closing Working Capital or Closing Indebtedness had such
subsequent events or subsequently discovered facts been known at the time of
the determination of the Final Closing Statement).

equal to (a) (i) Final Working Capital minus (ii) Estimated Working Capital
minus (b) (i) Final Closing Indebtedness minus (ii) Estimated Closing
Indebtedness. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then Buyer
shall pay in cash to Seller (or one or more Affiliates designated by Seller)
the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a
negative amount, then Seller (or an Affiliate designated by Seller) shall pay
in cash to Buyer the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing
Adjustment. Any such payment pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall be made
within ten Business Days after the determination of the Final Closing
Statement by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

401(a) of the Code has received from the IRS a favorable determination letter
(or in the case of a master or prototype plan, a favorable opinion letter or
in the case of a volume submitter plan, a favorable advisory letter) as to its
qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code, and nothing has occurred that
would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the qualified or exempt
status of such Seller Benefit Plan or trust, nor is the consummation of the

such effect.

Company will be responsible.

Knowledge of Seller, threatened Actions or Proceedings relating to a Seller
Benefit Plan. There are no pending or open examinations of any Seller Benefit
Plan by any Governmental Authority that could result in material liability to
the Company.

is a retiree welfare benefit plan, and following the Closing the Company will
have no Liability under any such retiree welfare benefit plan.

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except as set forth in

ARTICLE 5 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Buyer represents and warrants to Seller, as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing, as follows:

Section 5.01 Existence and Power. Buyer is a home-rule municipal corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
Texas and has all powers and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted.

Section 5.02 Authorization; Enforceability. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within the powers of Buyer and have been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer. This Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer
in accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. The
representative of Buyer executing this Agreement is authorized on behalf of
Buyer. This Agreement has been approved as to form by the City Attorney.

Section 5.03 Governmental Authorization.

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby require no material
action by or in respect





of, or material filing with, any Governmental Authority other than the
Required Regulatory Approvals.

(b) The HSR Act does not apply to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, notification of such transactions is not required under the HSR
Act, and no approval by, or pre-Closing filing with, the PUCT is required for
such transactions.

Section 5.04 Noncontravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (a) violate the Charter Documents of Buyer, (b)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03(a), violate
any Applicable Law, or (c) require any consent or other action by any Person
under, constitute a default under, or give rise to any right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of Buyer or to a loss
of any benefit to which Buyer is entitled under any provision of any agreement
or other instrument binding upon Buyer.

Section 5.05 Financial Capability.

(a) Buyer (i) will have sufficient internal funds available to pay the
payments contemplated hereby and any expenses incurred by Buyer in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) will have the resources and
capabilities (financial or otherwise) to perform its obligations hereunder,
and (iii) will have not incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or
liability of any kind, which would impair or adversely affect such resources
and capabilities. In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds
or financing by or to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any other financing
transaction be a condition to any of the obligations of Buyer hereunder.

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, Buyer has received an executed debt
commitment letter dated as of the date of this Agreement, including all
exhibits and schedules thereto (the "Commitment Letter") (and, if certain
terms of the Debt Financing are set forth in fee letters or other agreements,
Buyer has provided to Seller, on a confidential basis, copies of such fee
letters or other agreements) from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the "Debt
Financing Source"), pursuant to which the Debt Financing Source has committed,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide to Buyer the
amount of financing set forth in the Commitment Letter (the "Debt Financing"),
for the Financing Purposes. A true and complete copy of the Commitment Letter
has been previously provided to Seller. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Commitment Letter (A) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and,
to the knowledge of Buyer, each other party thereto, and is enforceable in
accordance with its terms against Buyer and, to the knowledge of Buyer, each
other party thereto, subject, in each case, to the Enforceability Exceptions
and (B) has not been amended, modified, withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in
any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred that
would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach under the Commitment
Letter on the part of Buyer other than any such breach that has been waived by
the Debt Financing Source or otherwise cured in a timely manner by Buyer to
the satisfaction of the Debt Financing Source. As of the date of this
Agreement, no material amendment or modification to, or withdrawal,
termination or rescission of, the Commitment Letter is contemplated by Buyer
or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any other party thereto which (1) adds new (or
modifies, in a manner adverse to Buyer, any existing) material conditions or
contingencies to the consummation of the Debt Financing, (2) reduces the
amount thereof below the amount





required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents or (3) prevents, impedes or delays in any material
respect the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Transaction Documents. The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the
Commitment Letter will be sufficient for Buyer and its Affiliates to complete
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents,
and to satisfy all of the obligations of Buyer and its Affiliates under this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents, including (x) paying the Purchase
Price at the Closing and (y) paying all related fees and expenses
(collectively, the "Financing Purposes"). The Commitment Letter contains all
of the conditions precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the
Debt Financing on the terms set forth therein.

Section 5.06 Solvency. Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and assuming that the
representations and warranties of Seller herein are true and correct in all
material respects, (i) the fair value of the assets of each of Buyer and the
Company will be greater than the total amount of its respective liabilities
(whether or not reflected in a balance sheet prepared in accordance with
GAAP), (ii) Buyer and the Company will be able to pay its debts and
obligations in the ordinary course of business as they become due, and (iii)
Buyer and the Company will have adequate capital to carry on its businesses
and all businesses in which it is about to engage, from and after the Closing.
In completing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer does not
intend to, and does not intend for the Company to, hinder, delay or defraud
any present or future creditors of Buyer, Seller or the Company.

Section 5.07 Purchase for Investment. Buyer is purchasing the Membership
Interests for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or
together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Membership Interests and is capable of
bearing the economic risks of such investment. Buyer acknowledges that the
sale of the Membership Interests hereunder has not been registered under the
Securities Act or any state securities laws, and that the Membership Interests
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated, or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, pursuant
to an exemption from the Securities Act or in a transaction not subject
thereto.

Section 5.08 Litigation. There is no Action or Proceeding pending against, or
to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened in writing against, Buyer before any
arbitrator or any Governmental Authority which in any manner challenges or
seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer is not subject to any Order, except to
the extent any such Order would not reasonably be expected to materially
affect Buyer's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.09 Broker Fees. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, whose fees
and expenses will be paid by Buyer, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act
on behalf of Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.





Section 5.10 Inspections; No Other Representations.

(a) Buyer is an informed and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert
advisors, experienced in the evaluation and purchase of companies such as the
Company as contemplated hereunder. Buyer has undertaken such investigation and
has been provided with and has evaluated such documents and information as it
has deemed necessary to enable it to make an informed and intelligent decision
with respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. To
the knowledge of Buyer, Seller and the Company have given Buyer complete and
open access to the key employees, documents and facilities of the Company.
Buyer will undertake prior to the Closing such further investigation and
request such additional documents and information as it deems necessary. Buyer
agrees to accept the Membership Interests and the Company in the condition
they are in on the Closing Date based upon its own inspection, examination and
determination with respect thereto as to all matters, and without reliance
upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any nature made
by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller or the Company, except for the
representations and warranties of Seller expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

(b) Buyer acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties
expressly set forth in this Agreement, none of Seller, any of its Affiliates
(including the Company), or any of their respective representatives has made
or is making any express or implied representation or warranty of any nature
to Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their representatives, at law or in equity,
with respect to Seller, any of its Affiliates (including the Company) or any
other matter related to the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyer hereby
expressly disclaims reliance on any such other representations or warranties
(including as to the accuracy or completeness of any information provided to
Buyer). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges
that (i) the Company and Seller make no representation or warranty with
respect to any projections, estimates or budgets delivered to or made
available to Buyer of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Company ("Forecasts"), (ii) the Forecasts, although
prepared by Seller or its Affiliates (or their respective representatives) in
good faith, may not have not been prepared in accordance with GAAP or
standards applicable under any securities laws, reflect numerous assumptions
and are subject to material risks and uncertainties, and (iii) the actual
future revenues, future results of operations (or any component thereof),
future cash flows or future financial condition (or any component thereof) of
the Company may vary, perhaps materially, from the Forecasts.

Section 5.11 Accounting Firm. Grant Thornton LLP is not the principal
accounting firm of Buyer.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller will (i) cause the

prior to the Closing;

(vii) issue, sell, pledge or dispose of, or agree to issue, sell, pledge or
dispose of, any Equity Interests of the Company, including the Membership

(xii) other than as contemplated in clause (ii) of this Section 6.01, make any
investment in or acquisition of any assets or properties, other than purchases
of inventory and supplies or other property or assets in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice;

(xiii) subject any material asset of the Company to any Lien, other than
Permitted Liens or Liens that will be released at or prior to the Closing; or

(xiv) agree or commit to do or take any action described in this Section 6.01.

provided, however, that in the event that the Company would be prohibited from
taking any action by reason of this Section 6.01 without the prior written
consent of Buyer, such action may nevertheless be taken without such consent
if (i) the Company is required to take such action by Applicable Law or (ii)
the Company requests Buyer's written consent and Buyer fails to respond in
writing to such request within five Business Days after the date of such
request. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will be entitled to pay cash
dividends or otherwise make cash distributions to Seller at any time prior to
the Closing.

(c) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller will cause the Company
to satisfy, in all material respects, the requirements of the Tax Abatement
Agreements necessary for the full tax abatements available thereunder.

(d) Promptly after the date hereof, Seller will cause the Memphis Parts, all
of which are set forth on Schedule 6.01(d), to be (i) delivered to the Project

expense at least five days prior to the Closing Date and (ii) transferred to
the Company prior to the Closing, free and clear of all Liens other than

Section 6.02 Access to Company Information.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller will give, and will
cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to give, Buyer and its counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives reasonable
access, on reasonable notice and during regular business hours, to the
offices, properties, books and records, and officers and employees of the
Company and, to the extent relating to the Company and its operations, of
Seller and, to the extent of the Shared Assets and Shared Contracts, of
Seller's other Affiliates; provided that such access will not, in any case,
include any invasive sampling or testing; and, provided further, that any
requests for such access will be directed to Seller or such other Person as
Seller may designate in writing from time to time. Any investigation pursuant
to this Section 6.02(a) will be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company. No investigation
will be permitted to the extent it would require the Company to disclose
information subject to confidentiality obligations, provided that Seller (i)
notifies Buyer of the nature of the information subject to such obligations
and (ii) at the request of Buyer, uses commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent to such disclosure from the beneficiary of such
obligations.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer will not have access to personnel
records of the Company relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, medical histories or other information the disclosure of which, in
Seller's good faith opinion, could subject the Company to risk of liability.
Neither the Company nor Seller makes any representation or warranty as to the
accuracy or completeness of the information (if any) provided pursuant to this
Section 6.02, and Buyer may not rely on the accuracy or completeness of such
information, in each case other than as expressly set forth in Seller's
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Subject to Section 6.02(a) and (b), Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as is reasonably requested by
Buyer to assist Buyer in connection with its efforts to prepare for its
ownership of the Company, its operation and maintenance of the Facility
(through its ownership of the Company), and its efforts to engage an OandM
Provider to operate and maintain the Facility following the Closing Date,
including (i) providing Buyer and prospective OandM Providers with reasonable
access to the Facility and (ii) promptly furnishing Buyer and prospective OandM
Providers with all readily available documentation and other information
reasonably requested by Buyer or such prospective OandM Providers relating to
the operation and maintenance of the Facility, other than Seller's or its
Affiliates' (other than the Company) proprietary information. Buyer shall (i)
promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller or its
representatives in connection with the access and information requested
pursuant to this Section 6.02(c); provided that if Seller incurs costs and
expenses under this Section 6.02(c) that are also within Seller's obligations
under the Transition Services Agreement, such costs and expenses shall be
reimbursed through the Transition Services Agreement and (ii) indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its representatives from and against any and all
Losses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with such access and
information, other than arising from





intentional misrepresentation, intentional misstatements or intentional
omissions on the part of Seller.

Section 6.03 Resignations. At or prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to
Buyer the resignations of all officers, directors, and managers of the
Company, effective as of the Closing.

Section 6.04 Confidentiality.

(a) That certain letter agreement covering confidentiality and nondisclosure,
dated December 6, 2018, between Seller and Buyer is hereby terminated, with no
further force or effect.

(b) Except as provided in Section 6.04(c) and Section 6.10, each party agrees
not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party for a period
of two years after the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement,
except that a party may disclose Confidential Information of the other party
(i) to the disclosing party's Affiliates or its or their respective
representatives (including the OandM Provider) who have a legitimate need to
know such information, provided that the disclosing party shall be responsible
for any breach of the applicable terms of this Section 6.04(b) by any such
Person to which it disclosed Confidential Information of the other party, (ii)
in connection with any Action or Proceeding for which the disclosing party is
conducting the defense thereof, provided that such party has taken all
reasonable actions to limit the scope and degree of disclosure, (iii) in any
Action or Proceeding brought by a Party in pursuit of its rights or in the
exercise of its remedies under this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iv) as may reasonably be necessary in
connection with any financing or prospective financing transaction.

(c) Either party shall be permitted to disclose Confidential Information of
the other party in any filing or proceeding in respect of a Required
Regulatory Approval or a filing on Form 8-K pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, provided that the disclosing party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek an appropriate protective order with
respect thereto. In addition, if a party or any of its representatives is
requested or required by deposition, interrogatory, request for documents
(including under the Public Information Act), subpoena, civil investigative
demand, other legal process or Applicable Law to disclose any Confidential
Information of the other party, to the extent legally permissible the party
requested or required to so disclose shall provide the other party with prompt
prior written notice (and in any event, within three calendar days) of such
request or requirement, which notice shall include the terms and circumstances
surrounding such requested or required disclosure, in order to enable such
other party (at its sole expense) to (i) seek an appropriate protective order
or other remedy or (ii) waive compliance, in whole or in part, with this
Section 6.04(c), and the party obligated to disclose shall consult and
reasonably cooperate with the other party, at such other party's sole expense,
to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law with respect to taking steps
to resist or narrow the scope of such disclosure. If, in the absence of a
protective order, a party or any of its representatives reasonably believes in
good faith, after consulting with counsel, that it is required by Applicable
Law to disclose Confidential Information of the other party, or that such
disclosure is required in order to obtain any Required Regulatory Approval,
the disclosing party shall (or shall cause its representatives to) furnish
only that portion of the Confidential Information of the other party that the
disclosing party or its representatives reasonably believe is so required.





(d) It is expressly understood by the parties that Buyer is subject to Chapter
552 of the Texas Government Code (the "Public Information Act"). Release of
Confidential Information by either party for the limited purposes authorized
herein is not to be construed as a waiver of any exceptions to the Public
Information Act's disclosure requirements that may apply to the Protected
Information.

Section 6.05 Post-Closing Access; PPA Payment.

(a) On and after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Company to afford
promptly to Seller and its agents reasonable access to its properties, books
of account, financial and other records (including accountant's work papers),
information, employees and auditors to the extent necessary or useful for
Seller in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation or
any other reasonable business purpose relating to the Company; provided that
any such access by Seller will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of the Company. Seller will bear all of the out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees, but excluding reimbursement for
general overhead, salaries and employee benefits) reasonably incurred in
connection with the foregoing.

(b) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in no event later than fifteen
calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to
Seller any accounts receivable due from Buyer or other amounts to be paid by
Buyer that were accrued on or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the PPA
(collectively, the "PPA Payments"), subject to a true-up adjustment if
additional information becomes known, in which case an invoice for such
adjustment shall be paid not later than fifteen days after Buyer's receipt of
such invoice.

Section 6.06 Contact with Customers and Suppliers. Prior to the Closing, Buyer
and Buyer's representatives will contact and communicate with the employees,
customers, resellers, vendors, suppliers and other business relations (other
than potential financing sources) of the Company, or of Seller or its other
Affiliates with respect to the Company's operations, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement only to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law and only with the prior written consent of Seller, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

Section 6.07 Employee Matters.

(a) Employee Information Updates. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable of any
changes to the Employee List as a result of (a) the hiring of a Business
Employee by Seller or its applicable Affiliates, (b) the termination of a
Business Employee's employment with Seller or its Affiliates or (c) the
transfer of a Business Employee to another position with Seller and its
Affiliates. Prior to Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer reasonable access to
Seller's premises and records relating to the Business Employees to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law. The Parties agree that Seller and its Affiliates
may continue to post job openings on internal job boards, and otherwise
communicate about and advertise such job openings with Business Employees in
the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice. Furthermore,
the Parties agree that Seller and its Affiliates may transfer the employment
of the Business Employees (such that such individuals remain employed by
Seller or its Affiliates but are no longer Business Employees) in the ordinary





course of business, consistent with past practice, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Transition Services Agreement.

(b) Offers of Employment to Business Employees. Buyer shall, or shall cause a
third-party operations and maintenance provider (the "OandM Provider") to, give
offers of employment at the Facility to each of the Business Employees no
later than ten Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Such offers of
employment will comply with the requirements of Section 6.07(c) and shall be
contingent upon and effective as of the occurrence of the Closing. Should
Buyer or the OandM Provider, as applicable, also wish to make offers contingent
upon any other conditions, including post-offer background, drug and/or
alcohol screenings, Buyer shall ensure that such screenings shall not be
conducted any sooner than 30 days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall not be required, and shall not be required to cause
the OandM Provider, to make an offer of employment to any employee of Seller who
is on long-term disability leave as of the Closing Date (a "Disability
Employee") unless such Disability Employee who otherwise would have been a
Business Employee returns to active employment during the Continuation Period
(as defined below). A Business Employee who is on short-term disability leave
as of the Closing Date who subsequently qualifies for long-term disability
benefits shall receive long-term disability benefits pursuant to the
applicable Seller Benefit Plan (under which Seller and its Affiliates shall
retain all Liabilities) and not pursuant to a long-term disability benefit
plan of Buyer.

A Business Employee who accepts an offer of employment and becomes employed by
Buyer or the OandM Provider or their Affiliates is referred to as a
"Transferring Employee." It is expressly understood and agreed that Buyer's or
the OandM Provider's, as applicable, offers to Business Employees shall not
constitute any commitment, contract or understanding, express or implied, of
any obligation on the part of Buyer, the OandM Provider or their Affiliates to a
post-Closing employment relationship of any fixed term. Any such Business
Employee who transfers employment within, or accepts a position with, Seller
or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date shall no longer be considered a
Business Employee and shall not become a Transferring Employee. Severance or
other separation benefits will not be offered by Seller to any Business
Employee who (i) rejects Buyer's or OandM Provider's offer of employment in a
job position that is similarly situated to the job position the Business
Employee held immediately prior to the Closing at the Facility, (ii) has an
offer of employment rescinded by the OandM Provider due to non-compliance with
any pre-employment screening, or (iii) otherwise voluntarily leaves employment
with Seller prior to the Closing Date.

(c) Compensation and Employee Benefits.

(i) Compensation and Benefits Comparability. For a period commencing on the
Closing Date and expiring at the end of the first full calendar year following
the year in which the Closing Date occurs (the "Continuation Period"), Buyer
will, or will cause the OandM Provider to, provide to each Transferring
Employee, for so long as such Transferring Employee remains employed during
the Continuation Period, (A) base pay and annual incentive compensation
opportunities that are not less than such Transferring Employee's base pay and
annual incentive compensation opportunities immediately prior to the Closing
and (B) a total value of employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, at
least as favorable as the employee benefits provided to the Transferring
Employees by Seller





(including equity-based compensation, severance benefits, retiree health
benefits, retiree life benefits, pension, medical costs, 401(k) matching, life
insurance, long term disability and other employee benefits specifically
required pursuant to this Section 6.07, but specifically excluding voluntary
benefits), it being understood that the provisions of this sentence shall
cease to apply with respect to a Transferring Employee upon termination of
such Transferring Employee's employment with Buyer, the OandM Provider and their
Affiliates, as applicable, and that Buyer or the OandM Provider, as applicable,
need not replicate specific items of employee benefits and may satisfy its
obligations through a different combination of employee benefits than are
provided prior to the Closing Date. Provided that Buyer makes contributions to
each Transferring Employee's account under Buyer's 401(k) Plan (as defined
below) and/or provides cash bonuses to such Transferring Employee that, in the
aggregate, equal or exceed the value indicated on the Employee List for each
such Transferring Employee related to lost pension, retiree health, retiree
life and equity-based compensation benefits during the Continuation Period,
Seller agrees that Buyer shall have met Buyer's obligations specifically for
the value of lost pension, retiree health, retiree life and equity-based
compensation benefits under clause (B) of this Section 6.07(c)(i). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require
Buyer or the OandM Provider to offer (i) retiree health or retiree life
benefits, (ii) defined benefit pension benefits, (iii) voluntary benefits, or
(iv) equity-based compensation to any Transferred Employees. If any
Transferring Employee's employment is terminated without cause during the
Continuation Period, subject to such Transferring Employee's execution and
non-revocation of a release of claims against Seller and, as applicable, Buyer
or the OandM Provider, Buyer will, or will cause the OandM Provider to, provide
such Transferring Employee with the severance benefits pursuant to the terms
of Seller's applicable severance plan or policy as set forth on Schedule
6.07(b); provided, however, that the calculation of any such severance
benefits shall take into account such Transferring Employee's service with
Seller or its Affiliate. Following the Closing Date, Seller shall have no
liability with respect to severance benefits for Transferring Employees whose
employment is terminated by Buyer or the OandM Provider, and Buyer shall, or
shall be obligated to cause the OandM Provider to, pay the benefit for and
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from any claim by or on
behalf of any Transferring Employee for any severance benefits alleged to be
payable by Buyer or the OandM Provider. The form and terms of any particular
benefit plan offered by Buyer or the OandM Provider, as applicable, shall be as
determined by Buyer or the OandM Provider, as applicable, subject to the
foregoing and the other provisions of this Article 6.

(ii) Service Credit. Buyer will, or will cause the OandM Provider to, recognize
the service (including industry experience, as applicable) of each of the
Transferring Employees recognized by Seller for all benefits purposes,
including eligibility for, vesting and accrual of, and determination of the
levels of such benefits. However, service will not be recognized to the extent
it would result in duplication of benefits for the same period of service or
for purposes of grandfathered benefits.

(iii) Welfare Plans. Buyer will, or will cause the OandM Provider to, use
reasonable best efforts to waive or cause the waiver of any limitation on
benefits relating to pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions,
evidence of insurability and





waiting periods for the Transferring Employees under any plan sponsored or
maintained by Buyer, the OandM Provider or their Subsidiaries, as applicable, in
which the Transferring Employees participate immediately after the Closing
Date providing medical, life or disability benefits, to the extent that such
limitations are waived or otherwise inapplicable to a Transferring Employee
under any comparable plan of Seller as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall, or
shall cause the OandM Provider to, use reasonable best efforts to cause all
healthcare expenses incurred by Transferring Employees or any eligible
dependent thereof, including any alternate recipient pursuant to qualified
medical child support orders, in the portion of the calendar year preceding
the Closing Date that were qualified to be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket limit under any Seller health care
plan will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any deductible or
out-of-pocket limit under the healthcare plan of Buyer or the OandM Provider for
such calendar year. Seller will use reasonable best efforts to provide such
information to Buyer or Buyer's designee. Seller will be responsible for
making available COBRA Continuation Coverage to any current and former
employees of Seller, including Business Employees, or to any qualified
beneficiaries of such employees, who become entitled to COBRA Continuation
Coverage as a result of loss of group health coverage under a Seller Benefit
Plan. Buyer will, or will cause the OandM Provider to, be responsible for making
available COBRA Continuation Coverage to any Transferring Employees (and their
qualified beneficiaries) who become entitled to such COBRA Continuation
Coverage on or after the Closing Date as a result of their loss of group
health plan coverage under any plan sponsored or maintained by Buyer or the
OandM Provider, as applicable.

(iv) Vacation. Seller agrees to be solely responsible and liable for all
banked vacation or banked personal time off as of December 31, 2018 for all
Transferring Employees, and hereby agrees to provide a cash payment to all
such Transferring Employees in an amount equal to the cash equivalent of all
such banked vacation or banked personal time off based upon the Transferring
Employee's wage or salary on the day prior to the Closing Date. From and after
the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the OandM Provider to, assume and
honor all vacation service dates of the Transferring Employees and credit each
Transferring Employee with all vacation and other personal time off of the
Transferring Employee accrued on or after January 1, 2019, but unused prior to
the Closing Date; provided, however, if Seller or any of its Affiliates is
required under Applicable Law to make a payment in settlement of vacation and
other personal time-off of any Transferring Employee that was accrued on or
after January 1, 2019, but unused, Buyer shall make such payment or reimburse
and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for such payment. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to require Buyer or the OandM Provider to continue
any ability of the Transferred Employees to carry over unused vacation or paid
time off after the end of the Continuation Period.

(v) Disability Benefits; Worker's Compensation; Paid Leave. Through the
Closing Date, Seller or its Affiliates shall maintain the short-term
disability and long-term disability plans or programs, worker's compensation,
and any related insurance policies or other funding or administrative
arrangements, presently in effect with respect to the Business Employees, and
will handle any claim for benefits thereunder in the ordinary course of
business. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller or its Affiliates shall make
reasonable





best efforts to transfer and assign all such insurance policies and other
funding arrangements, to the extent applicable to the Transferring Employees,
and Seller's or its Affiliate's rights thereunder to Buyer, the OandM Provider
or their Affiliates, as applicable, effective as of the Closing Date, at which
time Buyer, the OandM Provider or their Affiliates, as applicable, shall assume
responsibility for all such disability benefits (other than worker's
compensation benefits) in respect of the Transferring Employees. Seller shall
retain liability for (A) all worker's compensation benefits with respect to
claims incurred prior to the Closing Date and (B) long-term disability claims
for Transferred Employees receiving short-term disability benefits as of the
Closing Date. If Seller, its Affiliate, or the insurance carrier of Seller or
its Affiliate makes any payments for short-term disability, long-term
disability, or worker's compensation to or on behalf of a Transferring
Employee that are the responsibility of Buyer or the OandM Provider as provided
in this Agreement, Buyer shall reimburse Seller or its Affiliate, as
applicable, for the payments, promptly after receipt of any accounting
statement from Seller, to the extent of Seller's or its Affiliate's out-of-
pocket costs therefor, and if Buyer, the OandM Provider or the insurance carrier
of Buyer or the OandM Provider makes any such payments that are the
responsibility of Seller or its Affiliate as provided in this Agreement,
Seller shall reimburse Buyer or the OandM Provider for the payments, promptly
after receipt of any accounting statement from Buyer or the OandM Provider, as
applicable, to the extent of such Person's out-of-pocket costs therefor. In
addition, for the Continuation Period, Buyer shall, or shall cause the OandM
Provider to, continue to provide (x) compensation and employee benefits to all
Transferring Employees pursuant to the paid leave policies of Seller in effect
immediately prior to the Closing and (y) employee benefits to all Transferring
Employees on disability leave pursuant to the disability leave of absence
policies of Seller in effect immediately prior to Closing, provided that,
nothing in this subsection (v) shall require Buyer or the OandM Provider to
offer any benefit excluded by subsection (i) of this Section 6.07(c) during or
after any paid time off or disability leave of absence.

(d) Benefit Plan Assets and Liabilities Generally.

(i) Seller Benefit Plans. From and after the Closing Date, the Transferring
Employees shall cease to be active participants in the Seller Benefit Plans
that are not Company Benefit Plans.

(ii) Flexible Spending Accounts. As of the Closing Date, with respect to each
Transferring Employee participating immediately prior to the Closing Date in
any Seller Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan that is a health flexible
spending account or dependent care flexible spending account plan (the "Seller
FSA Plans"), Seller will, or will cause the Company to, transfer from the
Seller FSA Plans to the applicable health flexible spending account or
dependent care flexible spending account plan designated by Buyer or the OandM
Provider, as applicable, (the "Buyer FSA Plan"), the account balances
(positive or negative) of such Transferring Employees. Each Transferring
Employee will be permitted to continue to have payroll deductions made
pursuant to the Buyer FSA Plan as most recently elected by him or her under
the applicable Seller FSA Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the Closing Date, Seller will provide Buyer or its designee with a
reconciliation of the underspent and overspent flexible spending accounts of





Transferring Employees in the Seller FSA Plans. Amounts forfeited by
Transferring Employees in the Buyer FSA Plan at the end of the plan year
during which the Closing occurs will be assets of Buyer or the OandM Provider,
as applicable.

(iii) Incentive Program. Within 30 days following the Closing Date, Seller
shall pay or cause to be paid to each Transferring Employee who is a
participant in an annual cash performance pay program of Seller (a "PPP") the
amount of compensation accrued, but not paid, through the Closing Date, with
respect to such Transferring Employee under the PPP.

(e) Retirement Plans.

(i) Seller shall fully vest all Transferring Employees in their account
balances under the Southern Company Employee Savings Plan (the "Seller's
401(k) Plan"), effective as of the Closing Date. Effective as of the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, or shall cause the OandM Provider to, maintain or designate,
or cause to be maintained or designated, a defined contribution plan and
related trust intended to be qualified under Sections 401(a), 401(k) and
501(a) or 403(b) of the Code (the "Buyer's 401(k) Plan"). Effective as of the
Closing Date, the Transferring Employees shall cease participation in Seller's
401(k) Plan, and the Transferring Employees shall be eligible to participate
and shall commence participation in Buyer's 401(k) Plan in accordance with the
terms of Buyer's 401(k) Plan. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, and Buyer
shall, or shall cause the OandM Provider to, cooperate, to permit each
Transferring Employee to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover
distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) to
Buyer's 401(k) Plan in cash in an amount equal to the full account balance
distributed to such Transferring Employee from Seller's 401(k) Plan. Buyer
will, or will cause the OandM Provider to, use reasonable best efforts to permit
such rollover contributions in the form of notes representing an employee loan
under Seller's 401(k) Plan and Buyer shall, or shall cause the OandM Provider
to, take (or cause to be taken) any and all reasonable action as may be
required to provide that Transferring Employees may continue to service any
such loans through payroll deductions after the Closing Date.

(ii) With regard to the Seller Pension Plan, each Transferring Employee shall
cease to be a participant under such plan effective as of the Closing. Seller
shall fully vest all Transferring Employees participating in the Seller
Pension Plan in their accrued benefit under such plan effective as of the
Closing.

(iii) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, Buyer shall not become
responsible for, and Seller shall retain and be solely responsible for any and
all Liabilities under, related to or in connection with the Southern Company
Pension Plan or any successor plan, whether related to the Business Employees,
Transferring Employees or any other participants therein.

(f) WARN Act. Seller shall provide to Buyer on the Closing Date, a written
list of all terminations of Business Employees that occurred within the 90-day
period prior to the Closing Date. Buyer will indemnify Seller and its
Affiliates, from and against any Liabilities that may be incurred by Seller
under the WARN Act arising at or after the Closing Date as a result of any





action or omission of Buyer or its Affiliates or the OandM Provider occurring
following the Closing Date.

(g) No Third-Party Beneficiaries. The provisions of this Section 6.07 are
solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or
former employee, director or independent contractor or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any employee benefit plan (sponsored by Seller or Buyer) for any
purpose. Nothing in this Section 6.07 shall be construed to (i) limit the
right of Seller, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates to amend or
terminate any employee plan, to the extent such amendment or termination is
permitted by the terms of the applicable plan, or (ii) require Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to retain or cause the retention of the employment of any
particular Transferring Employee for any fixed period of time following the
Closing Date.

Section 6.08 Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances; Regulatory
Approvals.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller
will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or desirable under Applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking the Required
Regulatory Approvals. Seller and Buyer agree that Seller, prior to the
Closing, and Buyer, after the Closing, will cause the Company to, execute and
deliver such other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and
to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to
consummate or implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Buyer and
Seller shall, and will cause their relevant Affiliates to, coordinate and
cooperate to assemble and submit to the relevant Governmental Authorities as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten Business Days of the date
hereof, an application for each of the Required Regulatory Approvals. Such
applications, including any amendments or supplements thereto, shall be
subject to the review and comment of the parties, and the approval of the
parties, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. All communications with any Governmental Authority or its staff
relating to any Required Regulatory Approval shall be subject to Section
6.08(c).

(c) Each Party will (i) promptly notify the other party of any communications,
oral or written, relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to that Party from any Governmental Authority and, subject to Applicable Law,
permit the other party to review in advance, and consult with and consider in
good faith the views of such other party in connection with, any proposed
written communication relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to any Governmental Authority; (ii) to the extent practicable, not
agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat; and (iii) furnish the other party as promptly as
practicable with copies of all correspondence,





filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their respective
representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members or
their respective staffs on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Following the Closing, Buyer and Seller will, and will cause their
respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents,
certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other actions as
may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.09 Certain Filings. Seller and Buyer will cooperate with one another
(a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or whether any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 6.10 Public Announcements. No party hereto will issue, or permit any
of its Affiliates or representatives to issue, any press release or otherwise
make any public statements or announcements regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of the
other party, except as otherwise determined to be necessary or appropriate to
comply with Applicable Law or any rules or regulations of any supervisory,
regulatory or other Governmental Authority or stock exchange having
jurisdiction over it or any of its Affiliates (including the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange), in which case the party
required to issue such press release or public announcement will use
reasonable efforts to provide the other party a reasonable opportunity to
comment on such press release or public announcement in advance of such
publication. The parties hereto will consult with each other concerning the
means by which the employees, customers, and suppliers of the Company and
others having dealings with the Company will be informed of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Agreement will limit either party's (or either party's
respective Affiliates') rights to disclose or announce the existence of this
Agreement, the Purchase Price, the general nature and structure of the
transaction described herein, the Closing, and in the case of Buyer, the
expected savings and other benefits to its customers resulting from the
transactions contemplated herein.

Section 6.11 Affiliate Contracts and Intercompany Accounts.

(a) All intercompany accounts between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other
than the Company), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
be settled as of the Closing (irrespective of the terms of payment of such
intercompany accounts), including all amounts payable or receivable in respect
of the Business Employees.

(b) Except (i) as set forth on Schedule 6.11(b), (ii) those contracts
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) the Shared Contracts, each Affiliate
Contract will be terminated at or before the Closing.





Section 6.12 Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer agrees to retain or cause to be retained all books and records
pertinent to Taxes of the Company (including Tax Returns) until the applicable
period for assessment under Applicable Law (giving effect to any applicable
extensions or waivers of which Buyer has knowledge) has expired, and to abide
by or cause such abidance with all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority. Prior to the expiration of such time period, Buyer
agrees to give (or cause to be given to) Seller reasonable notice prior to
transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records relating to
Tax matters and, if Seller so requests, Buyer will allow Seller to take
possession of such books and records. Seller and Buyer will cooperate as
reasonably requested by the other party in the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns and responding to and resolving inquiries, audits, claims, actions or
similar proceedings by any Taxing Authority (a "Tax Claim") in each case
relating to Pre-Closing Period Taxes of the Company, including the furnishing
or making available during normal business hours of records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney and other
reasonably necessary materials. Buyer agrees to promptly provide any notices
or written inquiries received from a Taxing Authority that pertain to a
Consolidated Tax Return.

(b) Seller will prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any Tax
Return with respect to the Company that is (i) required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date, or (ii) required to be filed after the Closing Date
that is a Consolidated Tax Return.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
will Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer have any rights or access to any Tax
Return or other Tax information of Seller and its Affiliates that does not
relate exclusively to the Company, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Consolidated Tax Return. Seller will control all proceedings and make all
decisions taken in connection with any Tax Claim relating to any Consolidated
Tax Return, and Buyer will have no right to participate.

(d) Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer will (i) take any action
(including following Closing on the Closing Date) or (ii) make, revoke or
modify any Tax election that, in either case, would be effective on or before
the day after the Closing Date or would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect Seller or its Affiliates. Buyer and its Affiliates will pay and
indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates against any Taxes of
Seller or any Affiliate of Seller resulting from any such action or election
by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer.

(e) Any Tax refund that is received by the Company or any Affiliate of the
Company (including, after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates) after the
Closing, and any amount credited against Tax to which the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company becomes entitled after the Closing, for or with
respect to Taxes paid by Seller, an Affiliate of Seller, or by the Company for
a Pre-Closing Period, will be for the account of Seller, and Buyer will, or
will cause its applicable Affiliate to, pay over to Seller an amount equal to
any such refund or credit within 15 days after receipt thereof or entitlement
thereto (except to the extent reflected in the Final Closing Statement). Buyer
will cause the Company, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to carry
forward any Tax asset arising in any Post-Closing Period that could be carried
back to a Pre-Closing Period.





(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the purchase and sale of the
Membership Interests will be treated by Buyer as the purchase and sale of the
assets of the Company for United States federal income Tax purposes. The
Purchase Price, plus the amount of the Company's liabilities included in the
amount realized on the sale of the Company's assets for United States federal
income Tax purposes, shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in a
manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the applicable Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller
an allocation schedule setting forth Buyer's determination of the allocation
of the Purchase Price plus the amount of the Company's liabilities included in
the amount realized on the sale of the Company's assets for United States
federal income Tax purposes (the "Allocation Schedule") within 90 days after
the Closing Date. Seller shall have 30 days to review the Allocation Schedule
and either notify Buyer that it is in agreement with such Allocation Schedule
or deliver, in writing, any objections that it may have with respect thereto.
Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes over
the Allocation Schedule. If any dispute regarding the Allocation Schedule
remains unresolved after 60 days following Buyer's delivery of such Allocation
Schedule to Seller, then each of Buyer and Seller shall make its own
determination as to the allocation contemplated by this Section 6.12(f). If
Buyer and Seller reach agreement on a final Allocation Schedule, Buyer and
Seller shall file all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) in a manner
consistent with the final Allocation Schedule and neither Buyer nor Seller
shall take any position (whether in Tax Claims, on Tax Returns, or otherwise)
that is inconsistent with such Allocation Schedule except as may be adjusted
by subsequent agreement following an audit by the Internal Revenue Service or
by court decision.

Section 6.13 No Control of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement is
intended to give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the Company's operations prior to the Closing. Prior to the Closing, the
Company will exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

Section 6.14 Use of Name; Phase Out. During the 90-day period following the
Closing, Buyer and the Company shall have a limited license to use the
Excluded Intellectual Property Rights in connection with the operation of the
Company's business and for transitional matters. Upon expiration of such time
period, Buyer will, and will cause the Company to, cease using the Excluded
Intellectual Property Rights, and will remove the Excluded Intellectual
Property Rights from any properties or assets relating to the Company, and
Buyer acknowledges that following such time period neither it nor any of its
Affiliates has any right whatsoever to use the Excluded Intellectual Property
Rights. Notwithstanding Buyer's right to use the Excluded Intellectual
Property Rights for the time period set forth above, Buyer agrees that (a)
neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will be deemed an agent,
representative or joint venture partner of Seller, (b) Seller and its
Affiliates will retain sole and exclusive ownership of the Excluded
Intellectual Property Rights, and all goodwill and rights related thereto, and
(c) Buyer and its Affiliates will not knowingly take any action in respect of
the Excluded Intellectual Property Rights that would adversely affect Seller
or its Affiliates, or the interest of Seller or its Affiliates in the Excluded
Intellectual Property Rights.

Section 6.15 FIRPTA. At or prior to the Closing, Seller will deliver to Buyer
a duly completed and executed certification of non-foreign status of Seller
prepared in accordance with Section 1.1445-2(b)(2) of the Treasury
regulations.





Section 6.16 Shared Assets and Shared Contracts.

(a) Shared Assets. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, prior to
the Closing, assign, convey and transfer to the Company, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens, all of Seller's or its Affiliates' right,
title and interest in and to the Shared Assets, other than the Excluded Assets
and the Shared Assets set forth in Schedule 6.16(a).

(b) Shared Contracts. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assign
to the Company all rights under the Shared Contracts to the extent relating to
the Company's business and operations, so as to allow Buyer or the Company to
continue to receive the benefit of such rights; provided, that to the extent
that such assignment is prohibited by any Applicable Law or would result in a
violation or breach of such Shared Contract (provided that such violation or
breach has not been cured despite Seller's commercially reasonable effort to
cure such violation or breach), or would require any Governmental Authority or
third party authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers, and such
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers have not been obtained
(provided that Seller has used its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such authorizations, approvals, consents or waiver), Seller shall enter into
in any reasonable and lawful arrangements agreed to in writing by Buyer and
designed to provide the benefits of the continued use of such Shared Contract
in accordance with its terms for the Company's business and operations.

(c) Costs and Expenses. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Section 6.16 shall be borne by Seller;
provided, however, that neither Buyer nor Seller shall have any obligation to
make any payment to any third party; provided further that any Transfer Taxes,
if any, incurred in connection with such transactions shall be borne one-half
by Seller and one-half by Buyer.

Section 6.17 Release.

(a) Effective as of the Closing and except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement (including Section 6.05 and Section 6.17(c)), Seller, on behalf
of itself and each of its Affiliates and each of their respective successors
and assigns, hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and completely waives and
releases and forever discharges Buyer and each of its Affiliates (including
the Company), and each of their respective successors and assigns (such
released Persons, the "Releasees"), of and from all debts, demands, Actions,

claims and other Liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in law
and in equity, arising out of or in connection with (i) any Affiliate
Contract, (ii) Seller's capacity as a member of the Company prior to the
Closing Date, including any obligation or Liability of the Company under the
Company's Charter Documents, and (iii) any Liability with respect to the PPA
(other than the PPA Payments). Seller shall not make, and Seller shall not
permit any of its Affiliates or their respective representatives to make, any
claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand,
including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against any of
Buyer's or its Affiliates' or any of their Releasees with respect to any
Liabilities or other matters released pursuant to this Section 6.17.





(b) Effective as of the Closing and except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement (including Section 6.05 and Section 6.17(c)), Buyer, on behalf
of itself and each of its Affiliates (including the Company following the

Releasees, of and from all debts, demands, Actions, causes of action, suits,

happened, arose or transpired from the beginning of time through the Closing
Date and (ii) any Liability with respect to the PPA. Buyer shall not make, and
Buyer shall not permit any of its Affiliates or their respective

any claim or demand, including any claim of contribution or any
indemnification, against any of Seller or its Affiliates or any of their
Releasees with respect to any Liabilities or other matters released pursuant
to this Section 6.17.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the PPA shall remain in full force and
effect until the Closing and (ii) Section 6.17(a) and Section 6.17(b) shall
not constitute a release from, waiver of, or otherwise apply to the terms of
this Agreement or any Liability or Contract expressly contemplated by this
Agreement to be in effect after the Closing, or any enforcement thereof.

Section 6.18 Litigation Support.

(a) From and after Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
the OandM Provider to, cooperate with Seller and its counsel in the defense or
prosecution of any litigation or other dispute resolution relating to the
Company or its operations, whether before or after the closing, including but
not limited to the Indemnified Litigation. Such cooperation shall include
making available to Seller all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and
information in Buyer's possession or under Buyer's control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller will
have full authority to make all decisions and determine all actions to be
taken with respect to the defense, settlement and appeal of the Indemnified
Litigation. In no event will Seller have authority to agree, without the
consent of Buyer, to any relief binding on Buyer or the Company other than the
payment of money damages by Seller without recourse to Buyer or the Company.

(b) If and for so long as Seller, Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates are prosecuting, contesting or defending any Action by a
third party in connection with (i) any transactions contemplated under this
Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act,
or transaction relating to, in connection with, or arising from this Agreement

its Affiliates (including the Company) and its and their officers and
employees to, cooperate with the other party and its Affiliates and their
respective counsel (at the expense of the requesting party) in such
prosecution, contest or defense, including by making available its personnel
and providing such testimony and access to its books and records as shall be
reasonably necessary in connection with such prosecution, contest or defense.

or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the

disagreement between or among any parties to the Commitment Letter or other
Debt Documents and (v) of any expiration or termination of the Commitment
Letter or other Debt Document. If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes,
or would reasonably be expected to become, unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing, including from
alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents and to satisfy
the other Financing Purposes ("Alternative Financing") as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event and the provisions of this
Section 6.19 shall be applicable to the Alternative Financing, and, for the
purposes of Section 5.05, all references to the Debt Financing shall be deemed
to include such Alternative Financing and all references to the Commitment
Letter or other Debt Documents shall include the applicable documents for the
Alternative Financing. Buyer shall (A) comply in all material respects with
the Commitment Letter and each definitive agreement with respect thereto
(collectively, with the Commitment Letter, the "Debt Documents"), and (B) not
permit, without the prior written consent of Seller, any material amendment or
modification to be made to, or any termination, rescission or withdrawal of,
or any material waiver of any provision or remedy under, any Debt Document or
the fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter that (individually or in
the aggregate with any other amendments, modifications or waivers) would
reasonably be expected to (1) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing under any Debt Document (including by changing the amount of fees to
be paid or original issue discount thereof) below the amount necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents and to satisfy the other Financing Purposes, or (2) impose any new
or additional material condition, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
condition in any material respect, to the receipt of any portion of the Debt
Financing in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay or
prevent the Closing, (y) make the funding of any portion of the Debt Financing
(or satisfaction of any condition to obtaining any portion of the Debt
Financing) materially less likely to occur or (z) adversely impact the ability
of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or the likelihood of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents. Until the
Closing, Buyer shall keep Seller reasonably informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt
Financing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, compliance by Buyer with this
Section 6.19 shall not relieve Buyer of its obligation





to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents, whether or not the Debt Financing is available.

Section 6.20 Cooperation. From and after the date of this Agreement, and
through the earliest of the Closing, the date on which this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Article 9 and the completion of the Debt
Financing, Seller shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, use reasonable
commercial efforts to provide such cooperation as is necessary and reasonably
requested by Buyer to assist Buyer in the arrangement of the Debt Financing or
any Alternative Financing for the Financing Purposes (it being acknowledged
and agreed by Buyer that the receipt of such Financing is not a condition to
the Closing), including (a) providing Buyer and the Debt Financing Source with
reasonable access to the Facility, (b) to the extent applicable and reasonably
requested by Buyer, causing the Company to execute and deliver customary
definitive financing documents; provided, that the effectiveness of any
definitive documentation executed by the Company shall be subject to the
occurrence of the Closing, and (c) furnishing Buyer and the Debt Financing
Source promptly, and in any event at least five Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, with all documentation and other information relating to the
Company and the Facility reasonably requested by the Debt Financing Source in
connection with the Debt Financing, including such documentation and
information which relates to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries and is required
by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Debt Financing under
applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, as amended, to the extent
requested by Buyer in writing at least ten Business Days prior to the expected
Closing Date. Nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it
would (A) unreasonably disrupt the conduct of the business or operations of
Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Company), (B) require Seller or
any of its Affiliates to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other cost or expense that is not reimbursed by Buyer or otherwise incur any
liability, guaranty or give any indemnities, in connection with the Debt
Financing, (C) require Seller or any of its Affiliates to take any action that
would reasonably be expected to conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, the Charter Documents of Seller or any of its Affiliates, any
applicable Laws or any Contract, or (D) require Seller to agree to any
amendment or modification of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or to
alter the economic or other terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Transaction Document. In addition, nothing herein shall
require Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of its representatives to (w)
deliver legal opinions, (x) participate in any rating agency sessions, (y)
deliver audited financial statements related to the Company or the Facility,
or (z) assist Buyer and the Debt Financing Source in the preparation of any
offering documents for the Debt Financing or any materials for rating agency
presentations, confidential information memoranda, business projections, pro
forma financial statements and similar documents in connection with the Debt
Financing. In furtherance of and without limitation to the second immediately
preceding sentence, nothing herein shall require Seller or any of its
Affiliates to enter into any agreement (or require their respective boards of
directors or equivalent governing bodies to approve any such agreement) in
connection with the Debt Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by
Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates or
their respective representatives in connection with the Debt Financing and
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Affiliates and their respective
representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the Debt Financing and any information





used in connection therewith, other than arising from intentional
misrepresentation, intentional misstatements or intentional omissions on the
part of Seller or its Affiliates.

Section 6.21 Casualty. If any assets or properties of the Company are damaged
or destroyed by fire or other event, occurrence or circumstance after the date
hereof but prior to the Closing (a "Casualty Loss"), and if the estimated cost
of repairing, replacing or restoring such damaged or destroyed assets or
properties to a condition reasonably comparable to their condition prior to
such Casualty Loss, as estimated by a qualified firm reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and Seller (the "Damage Cost"):

(a) is less than or equal to two percent (2.0%) of the Purchase Price, then
(i) such Casualty Loss shall not be taken into account for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 7.02 of this Agreement
have been satisfied, and (ii) Buyer shall be entitled to receive all casualty
insurance proceeds (and Seller shall cooperate in the collection and pay-over
of same), and such proceeds shall be excluded from the calculation of Closing
Working Capital;

(b) is greater than two percent (2.0%) of the Purchase Price but equal to or
less than fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price, then (i) the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the amount of the Damage Cost, (ii) such Casualty
Loss shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the
conditions set forth in Section 7.02 of this Agreement have been satisfied,
(iii) Seller shall be entitled to receive all casualty insurance proceeds in
connection with such Casualty Loss (and Buyer shall cooperate in the
collection and pay-over of same); or

(c) is greater than fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price (a "Total
Loss"), then either Seller or Buyer may elect to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Article 9 of this Agreement.

Section 6.22 No Solicitation of Other Bids.

(a) Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates
(including the Company) or any of its or their representatives to, directly or
indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate, or continue
inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person concerning a
possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Company) and all of its and their representatives to
immediately cease and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
could lead to, an Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition
Proposal" shall mean any inquiry, proposal, or offer from any Person (other
than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger, consolidation,
liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or other business combination
transaction involving the Company; (ii) the issuance or acquisition of Equity
Interests of the Company; or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange, or other
disposition of any significant portion of the Company's properties or assets.
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.22 is intended to
restrict or limit Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates (other than the
Company) from entering into, engaging in or consummating any transaction not
involving the Company or which





would involve the transfer of Seller or its Affiliates that does not modify
the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with this
Section 6.22 shall include having such provision specifically enforced by any
court with jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and agreed that any breach or
threatened breach of this Section 6.22 shall cause irreparable injury to Buyer
and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy.

Section 6.23 Insurance. From and after the Closing Date, the Company,
including the Project Site and Facility, shall cease to be insured by Seller's
or its Affiliates' insurance policies or by any of their self-insured
programs, and, except for claims with respect to Casualty Losses pursuant to
Section 6.21(a) or Section 6.21(b), and as provided in this Section 6.23, (a)
neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall have a right to make any claim under
such policies for any liability or other loss arising from events or
occurrences occurring after the Closing, and (b) Buyer shall be solely
responsible for providing insurance to the Company for any liabilities or
other losses arising from such events or occurrences. With respect to
liabilities and other losses arising from events or occurrences occurring
prior to the Closing, Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to add
Buyer and the Company as additional insureds on its liability insurance and
worker's compensation policies for pre-closing periods, for a period of not
less than one year after the Closing. Buyer agrees that it will, and that it
will cause the Company to, make any claims on such policies only through
Seller. Seller shall submit such claims and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (x) administer such claims, at Buyer's or the Company's sole cost
and expense, on behalf of Buyer and the Company (it being understood and
agreed that Seller shall have the right to administer and control such claims,
in consultation with Buyer) and (y) seek reasonable recovery for such claims
under the applicable insurance provisions of such policies. Buyer or the
Company shall be responsible for all deductibles, retentions, self-insurance
or payments of reimbursement obligations relating to such claims. Buyer also
agrees not to make, or to allow the Company to make, any claim under such
policies for any liability or other loss arising from events or occurrences
occurring after the Closing, and Buyer further agrees to indemnify Seller for
any claims made by third parties against Seller that seek recovery from
Seller's insurance policies for liabilities or other losses arising from
events or occurrences occurring after the Closing in respect of the Company's
assets, operations, or affairs provided, however, that Buyer's indemnification
obligations pursuant to this sentence shall not be applicable to any Liability
or other Loss to the extent that Seller is required to make any
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 8.02(a). For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all rights to control their
insurance policies and programs, including the right to exhaust, settle,
release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes with respect to any
of its insurance policies and programs. Buyer acknowledges that it shall be
responsible for procuring insurance in respect of the Company, including the
Project Site and Facility, effective on and after the Closing Date.

Section 6.24 New Title Policy. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to provide, and to cause its representatives to provide, to Buyer and
its Affiliates all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection
with Buyer obtaining (i) a new title report, a new title commitment, or a new
owner's policy of title insurance insuring the Company's Real Property
Interests in the Real Property (collectively, the "Updated Title Evidence"),
and/or (ii) a new or updated ALTA survey of the Real Property (the "New
Survey"), all at Buyer's sole direction, cost,





and expense. Additionally, as previously disclosed to Buyer, Seller has
contracted for certain updates to the Existing Surveys, which Seller agrees to
deliver to Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and
in any event by May 8, 2019 (the "Updated Survey"). As also previously
disclosed to Buyer, Seller is obtaining an updated or separate title
commitment to cover the land covered by the Underground Pipeline Easement
Agreement, dated March 2, 2011, from Angelina and Nacogdoches Counties Water
Control and Improvement District No. 1, as Grantor, to the Nacogdoches Power,
LLC, recorded in Volume 3070, Page 93, Rusk County, Texas, which Seller agrees
to deliver to Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof,
and in any event by May 8, 2019 (the "New Commitment"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operation of the Company, and the Company shall not be required to
make any payment or incur any cost, expense, liability, or obligation in
connection with Buyer's efforts to obtain Updated Title Evidence or new or
updated ALTA survey; provided, that if Buyer elects to obtain Updated Title
Evidence, Seller and the Company shall deliver to the title company a standard
owner's affidavit (with such commercially reasonable modifications as Seller
may require), copies of organizational documents and authorizing resolutions,
and other documents reasonably required by the title company to issue such
Updated Title Evidence. Buyer shall, promptly upon request of Seller,
reimburse Seller and the Company (prior to Closing) for all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses reasonably incurred by Seller or the Company in connection
with the cooperation required by this Section 6.24. If any of the Updated
Title Evidence, the New Survey, the Updated Survey, or the New Commitment
shows any title exceptions, documents or other matters that are not Permitted
Liens and that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
the ability to operate the Facility consistent with past practice, then Buyer
shall have the right to approve or disapprove any such matters by written
notice to Seller prior to May 14, 2019, and Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such all such timely objections at its sole cost
and expense.

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article 8 and except with respect to
Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness (which shall be governed
exclusively by Article 2) and indemnification for Taxes (which shall be

Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates, and each of
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all

for or taken into account in the determination of Final Working Capital; (B)
pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i), for any claim unless such claim or series of
related claims involve Losses in excess of $100,000 (the "De Minimis Amount"),
and if such Losses do not exceed the De Minimis Amount, such Losses shall not
be applied to or considered for purposes of calculating the aggregate amount
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties' Losses under Section 8.02(b)(i)(C); or (C)
pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i), until the aggregate amount of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties' Losses under Section 8.02(a)(i) exceeds $8,050,000 (the
"Threshold"), after which Seller shall be obligated for the Buyer Indemnified
Parties' Losses under Section 8.02(a)(i) for the amount of such Losses that
exceeds the Threshold; provided, that Section 8.02(b)(i)(B) and (C) shall not

Austin or any other political subdivision of the State of Texas is pledged
under this Agreement to the indemnity obligations of Buyer. Seller hereby
waives any claim or right of recovery under these indemnities against the
unrelated or non-derived general tax revenues or funds of the City of Austin
obtained by taxation.

Section 8.04 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Third Party Claims. If any Person entitled to receive indemnification
under this Agreement (an "Indemnitee") receives notice of any demand or claim
by any Person who is neither a party hereto nor an Affiliate of a party hereto
(a "Third Party Claim") which has or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification hereunder, or for which the Indemnitee may claim a right to
indemnification hereunder from the other party hereto (the "Indemnifying





Party"), the Indemnitee will promptly give written notice (a "Third Party
Claim Notice") of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party. Any such
Third Party Claim Notice shall (i) describe the nature, facts and
circumstances of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) state the
estimated amount of the indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained
by the Indemnitee, if practicable, (iii) state the method and computation
thereof, and (iv) contain specific reference to the provision or provisions of
this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification is claimed or
arises. The Indemnitee shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such other
information known to it or in its possession with respect to the Third Party
Claim as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.

(b) Right to Assume Defense. The Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and
expense, will have the right, upon written notice to the Indemnitee within 30
days (or such earlier time as may be required by the nature of the Third Party
Claim) of receiving a Third Party Claim Notice, to assume the defense of the
Third Party Claim through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee;
provided, that the Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, at
its expense, and the Indemnitee may assume control of the defense of the Third
Party Claim, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, if (i) upon the advice of
Indemnitee's counsel, a conflict of interest exists (or would reasonably be
expected to arise) that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to
represent both the Indemnifying Party and Indemnitee in connection with a
Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute
the defense of the Third Party Claim, or (iii) such Third Party Claim (A)
seeks non-monetary relief or (B) involves criminal or quasi criminal
allegations, and, provided further, that if the aggregate dollar amount of the
Third Party Claim, together with all other Third Party Claims (and all costs
and expenses reasonably estimated to be incurred in connection with the
defense thereof) and Direct Losses of which the Indemnifying Party is aware or
has received notice, would exceed the Cap, the Indemnitee may, at its option,
and to the extent in excess of the Cap at its sole cost and expense, assume
the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice upon written
notice to the Indemnifying Party.

(c) Defense of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.04(b), the Indemnifying
Party will diligently pursue such defense, and will keep the Indemnitee
reasonably informed with respect to such defense. The Indemnitee shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel, including making available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnitee's possession or
under the Indemnitee's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by
the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnitee will have the right to participate in
such defense, including appointing separate counsel, but the costs of such
participation shall be borne solely by the Indemnitee. Subject to Section
8.04(b), the Indemnifying Party will, in consultation with the Indemnitee,
make all decisions and determine all actions to be taken with respect to the
defense and settlement of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of
such Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
provided that it will not be deemed to be unreasonable for an Indemnitee to
withhold its consent if (i) such payment, compromise, settlement or
disposition does not involve solely the payment of money, (ii) such payment,
compromise, settlement or disposition involves a finding or admission of
violation of any Applicable Law, Order or permit or rights of any Person by
the Indemnitee or its Affiliates or (iii) such payment, compromise, settlement
or





disposition does not contain an unconditional release of the Indemnitee from
the subject matter of such payment, compromise, settlement or disposition. In
no event will the Indemnifying Party have authority to agree, without the
consent of the Indemnitee, to any relief binding on the Indemnitee other than
the payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Party without recourse to the
Indemnitee.

(d) Failure to Assume Defense. If the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend
such Third Party Claim, fails to timely notify the Indemnitee in writing of
its election to defend, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may defend such Third Party Claim and seek
indemnification for any and all indemnifiable Losses based upon, arising from
or relating to such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnitee
shall not pay, compromise, settle, or otherwise dispose of such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(e) Direct Losses. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an indemnifiable
Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Loss") will be
asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof, (i)
describing the nature, facts and circumstances of such indemnifiable Loss in
reasonable detail, (ii) stating the amount of the indemnifiable Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee, if practicable, (iii) stating the
method and computation thereof and (iv) containing specific reference to the
provision or provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises. The Indemnitee shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such other information with respect to the Direct Loss
as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request and shall cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel, including permitting reasonable access to
books, records, and personnel, in connection with determining the validity of
any claim for indemnification by the Indemnitee and in otherwise resolving
such matters. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of 20 days within
which to respond to such claim of a Direct Loss. If the Indemnifying Party
rejects such claim, or does not respond within such period, the Indemnitee may
seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification under this Agreement.

(f) Delay. A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Section 8.04
will affect the rights or obligations of a party or Indemnitee hereunder only
to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the party entitled to receive
such notice was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no claim for indemnification first made after
the expiration of the applicable survival period with respect to the
representation, warranty or covenant on which such claim is based set forth in
Section 8.01 will be valid and any such claim shall be deemed time-barred.

(g) Payments. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally
adjudicated to be payable pursuant to this Article 8, the Indemnifying Party
shall satisfy its indemnity obligations hereunder within ten Business Days
after such agreement or final adjudication, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with instructions provided by the Indemnitee.

(h) Materiality Scrape. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, (i) for purposes of calculating Losses in connection with a claim
for indemnification under this





Article 8 (but not for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach
of any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is addressed
in clause (ii)), each of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements that contain any qualifications as to materiality or Material
Adverse Effect shall be deemed to have been given as though there were no such
qualifications, and any such qualification shall be disregarded for purposes
of calculating the amount of any such Losses and (ii) for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach in connection with a claim for
indemnification under this Article 8 (but not for purposes of determining
Losses which are addressed in clause (i)), each of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements that contain a Material Adverse Effect
qualification shall be deemed to have been given as though such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement was instead qualified by
materiality.

Section 8.05 Exclusive Remedy. Except (i) with respect to the matters covered
by Section 2.03, Section 2.04, Section 2.05 and Section 2.06 (which shall be
exclusively governed by such Sections) (ii) with respect to any matter
relating to Taxes (which shall be governed exclusively by Section 6.12), (iii)
insurance matters covered by Section 6.23 and (iv) for the parties' right to
seek and obtain any equitable relief pursuant to Section 10.14, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification
provisions of Sections 8.02 and 8.03 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies
of the parties for any Liabilities or Losses (including any Liabilities or
Losses from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct
(including negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law,
statute, strict liability, or otherwise) that each party may at any time
suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement by any party, or any failure by
any party to perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its
terms, was to have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Buyer hereby waive, on behalf of
themselves and the other Seller Indemnified Parties and Buyer Indemnified
Parties, respectively, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
and all other rights, claims and causes of action (including rights of
contribution, rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any
Environmental Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or
warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty)
that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any tort or
breach of contract claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), or the
transactions contemplated hereby, known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have against the other
arising under or based upon any Applicable Law, common law, or otherwise.

Section 8.06 Additional Indemnification Provisions. With respect to each
indemnification obligation contained in this Article 8, all Losses shall be
net of indemnity proceeds that have been recovered by the Indemnitee in
connection with the facts giving rise to the right of indemnification (it
being agreed that if indemnification proceeds in respect of such facts are
recovered by the Indemnitee subsequent to the Indemnifying Party's making of
an indemnification payment in satisfaction of its applicable indemnification
obligation, such proceeds shall be promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party
to the extent that the indemnification payment made exceed the Losses
incurred), and the Indemnitee shall use, and cause its Affiliates to use,





commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery under all indemnity
provisions covering such Losses to the same extent as it would if such Losses
were not subject to indemnification hereunder.

Section 8.07 Limitation on Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any Applicable
Law, no party will be liable to the other party, either in contract or in
tort, for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or punitive
damages of the other party, including business interruption, loss of future
revenue, profits or income, diminution in value or loss of business reputation
or opportunity, relating to the breach or alleged breach hereof or otherwise,
whether or not the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to the other
party in advance or could have been reasonably foreseen by such other party,
and, in particular, no "multiple of profits," "multiple of cash flow,"
"multiple of assets" or similar valuation methodology shall be used in
calculating the amount of any indemnifiable Losses. The exclusion of
consequential, incidental, indirect, special, and punitive damages as set
forth in the preceding sentence does not apply to any such damages under any
Third Party Claim, in connection with Losses that may be indemnified pursuant
to this Article 8 after Closing.

Section 8.08 Mitigation.

(a) Each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any
Losses to the extent they arise out of or result from the Indemnitee's failure
to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such Losses.

(b) The amount of any indemnifiable Loss will be reduced to the extent of any
insurance proceeds or other payments actually received from an insurer or
other third party with respect to an indemnifiable Loss, or any Tax benefit
actually realized in cash or a reduction in Taxes otherwise payable as a
result of such Loss prior to the date such indemnity payment is made, in each
case, net of all costs of recovery. If the amount of any indemnifiable Loss,
at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect
thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement, or payment under or pursuant to
any insurance coverage or by recovery, settlement, or payment by or against
any other Person, the amount of such reduction (net of all costs of recovery),
will be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party reasonably promptly
following actual receipt or credit of such amounts.

(c) Upon making any indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the
extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the
Indemnitee against any third party in respect of the indemnifiable Loss to
which the indemnity payment relates.

ARTICLE 9 TERMINATION

Section 9.01 Grounds for Termination.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer.





(b) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
either Seller or Buyer if the Closing has not been consummated on or before
July 31, 2019, provided that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.01(b) will not be available to any party whose breach of any
provision of this Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be
consummated on or before such date; provided, further, that neither party will
not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(b) if the other party is actively pursuing specific performance of the
first party's obligations hereunder.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any
Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction.

(d) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing by
either Seller or Buyer in the event that a Casualty Loss constitutes a Total
Loss.

Section 9.02 Notice of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either or both of Seller and Buyer pursuant to Section 9.01,
written notice of such termination shall be given by the terminating party to
the other.

Section 9.03 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
permitted by Section 9.01, such termination will be without liability of any
party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
other representative of such party) to the other parties to this Agreement;
provided that such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for
Willful Breach. For purposes hereof, "Willful Breach" shall mean a breach that
is a consequence of a deliberate act or deliberate failure to act by the
breaching party with the knowledge that the taking of or failure to take such
act would cause or constitute a material breach of any covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement; provided that, without limiting the meaning of
Willful Breach, the parties acknowledge and agree that any failure by any
party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after the
conditions to the Closing applicable to such party as set forth in Article 7
have been satisfied or waived (except for those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, and which conditions would be
capable of being satisfied at the time of such failure to consummate the
Closing) shall constitute a Willful Breach of this Agreement by such party.
For the avoidance of doubt, (a) in the event that all applicable conditions to
the Closing applicable to Buyer set forth in Article 7 have been satisfied or
waived (except for those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, and which conditions would be capable of being satisfied at
the time of such failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), but Buyer fails to close for any reason, such failure to close
shall be considered a Willful Breach by Buyer and (b) the availability or
unavailability of financing for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall have no effect on Buyer's obligations hereunder. The
provisions of Section 6.04, 10.05, 10.07, 10.08 and 10.09 will survive any
termination hereof pursuant to Section 9.01.

Attorney-Client Privilege.

(a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company to waive
and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of
Seller or any shareholder, officer, employee or director of the Company (any
such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving this Agreement or
any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, by any legal
counsel currently representing the Company in connection with this Agreement
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, including Baker
Botts L.L.P. (the "Current Representation").

(b) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Company to waive
and to not assert, any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between any legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring
during the Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing
Representation, including in connection with a dispute with Buyer, and
following the Closing, with the Company, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control
such attorney-client privilege will be retained by such Designated Person.

Section 10.03 Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be (i) amended, if such amendment is
in writing and is signed by Buyer and Seller, and (ii) waived, if such waiver
is in writing and is signed by the waiving parties.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as set forth in
Section 8.05, the rights and remedies herein provided will be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

Section 10.04 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees, however denominated, incurred
in connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
direct or indirect real property transfer Tax (together with any interest,

Buyer, regardless of the Person on whom liability is imposed under Applicable
Law relating to such Taxes, and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all Transfer
Taxes, and, if required by Applicable Law, Seller will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. To the extent Seller or any Affiliate of Seller is required by
Applicable Law to pay any Transfer Taxes to a Taxing Authority, Buyer will
remit an amount equal to such Transfer





Taxes to Seller (or its applicable Affiliate) not less than five Business Days
prior to the due date for such payment.

Section 10.05 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each party will
pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or any of its Affiliates in

causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that may be based
upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution,
performance, interpretation or enforcement of this Agreement, will be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware without regard to the laws of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction that would call for the application of the substantive or
procedural laws of any jurisdiction other than Delaware.

Section 10.08 Jurisdiction. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally,
for itself and its property, submits to the exclusive jurisdiction in the
Delaware Court of Chancery (and if jurisdiction in the Delaware Court of
Chancery is unavailable, in the Superior Court in the City of Wilmington, New

of Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware is unavailable, in the federal
courts of the United States sitting in the State of Delaware), and any
appellate court from any thereof (such courts in such jurisdictional priority,
the "Forum"), in any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, and agrees that all
claims in respect of such suit, action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in the Forum, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (a) agrees not to commence any such suit, action or proceeding
except in the Forum, (b) agrees that any claim in respect of any such suit,
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in the Forum, (c) waives, to

proceeding in the Forum, and (d) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally
and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance

made in the State of Delaware.

Section 10.09 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION





BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF CONDUCT, COURSE
OF DEALING, ORAL OR WRITTEN STATEMENT OR ACTION OF ANY PARTY IN CONNECTION
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, IN
EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE.

Section 10.10 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement will become effective when each party
hereto will have received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement will have no effect and no party
will have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other communication). Except for the rights of
Indemnitees under Article 8, no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns.

agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral
and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

Section 10.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties will negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 10.13 Disclosure Schedules. Seller has set forth information on the
Seller Disclosure Schedules in a section thereof that corresponds to the
section of this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one
section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules need not be set forth in any other
section so long as its relevance to such other section of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the
face of the information disclosed therein to the Person to which such
disclosure is being made. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
Seller Disclosure Schedules may include certain items and information solely
for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and (b) the disclosure
by Seller of any matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedules will not be deemed
to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is required to be
disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.





Section 10.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a)
Buyer will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by Seller or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof by Seller and (b) Seller will be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Buyer or to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by
Buyer, in each case, in the United States District Court of Delaware or any
Delaware State court, in addition to any other remedy to which such parties
are entitled at law or in equity.
