_REIT Surviving Entity_ ") in the REIT Merger, upon the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland REIT Law (the
" _MD REIT Law_ ") and pursuant to which each outstanding common share of
beneficial interest, $0.001 par value per share, of the Company (the "

WHEREAS, prior to the REIT Merger, Partnership Merger Sub shall merge with and
into Company LP (such merger transaction, the " _Partnership Merger_ " and,

as the surviving entity and, following the REIT Merger, a subsidiary of the
REIT Surviving Entity (the " _Partnership Surviving Entity_ "), and each

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has (a)
determined that this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation thereof by
such Parties;

 



 

WHEREAS, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (and, where applicable, state

the Company pursuant to Section 331 and Section 562 of the Code, and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of liquidation" of the Company for U.S.
federal income Tax purposes, and (b) the Partnership Merger shall be treated
as (i) the sale of the Company Partnership Units by the Cash-Out Limited
Partners to the REIT Surviving Entity, and (ii) the contribution of Company
Partnership Units by the Roll-Over Limited Partners in Company LP in exchange
for New Partnership Preferred Units of the Partnership Surviving Entity in a
tax-deferred transaction under Section 721 of the Code to the extent
applicable to the exchange by each Roll-Over Limited Partner; and

its election to exchange all, but not less than all, of the Company
Partnership Units held by such Outside Limited Partner into New Partnership
Preferred Units. Any Outside Limited Partners election to receive New
Partnership Preferred Units shall be deemed to have been properly made only if

not elections to receive New Partnership Preferred Units have been properly
made or revoked. If Parent determines that any election to receive New
Partnership Preferred Units was not properly made, the Company Partnership
Units with respect to which such election was not properly made shall be

agreement of the Company, as sole general partner of Company LP, make such
rules as are consistent with this _Section 3.2(d)_ for the implementation of
elections provided for herein as shall be necessary or desirable to fully
effect such elections.

 



 

(iv) Each Outside Limited Partner, as a condition to making a Unit Election
with respect to such Outside Limited Partners Company Partnership Units,
shall (i) represent to Parent that it (A) is an Accredited Investor (as such
term is defined under Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act) and is
acquiring the New Partnership Preferred Units for investment purposes and not
with a view to distribution, and (B) is not a "benefit plan investor" within
the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or other plan, account or arrangement
(or entity whose assets constitute the assets of a plan, account or
arrangement) that is subject to any Laws or regulations that are similar to
the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, and (ii) agree to be bound by the terms
of the Surviving Partnership Agreement as it will be in effect immediately
following the Partnership Merger Effective Time (which agreement shall have
been amended by the Surviving Partnership Amendment incorporating the terms of
the New Partnership Preferred Units).

 



 

(v) The Company and Company LP shall reasonably cooperate with Parent in
preparing any disclosure statement or other disclosure information to

(vi) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Partnership shall deliver to each Outside Limited Partner entitled to receive

record ownership of the New Partnership Preferred Units issuable pursuant
hereto in respect of such Outside Limited Partners Company Partnership Units.

 



 

(vii) Each Person that receives New Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to
the terms of _Section 3.2(b)_ and this _Section 3.2(d)_ shall automatically
be admitted as a limited partner of the Surviving Partnership at the
Partnership Merger Effective Time.

 



 

 _Section 3.3_ _Effect on Company Equity Awards and Company Look-Back LTI
Awards_. All of the provisions of this _Section 3.3_ other than the first
sentence of _Section 3.3(b)_ shall be effectuated without any action on the
part of the holder of any Company Equity Award or Company Look-Back LTI Award
(and for the avoidance of doubt, the actions below shall result in the
appropriate issuances of additional Company Partnership Units to the Company
in the manner contemplated by Section 4.02 of the Company Partnership
Agreement):

 



 

(a) Immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, each Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time (whether or
not then vested or exercisable) shall become fully vested and exercisable
(regardless of the exercise price thereof). At the REIT Merger Effective Time,
each Company Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled in exchange
for the right to receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product
of (i) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, whether or not vested or
exercisable, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the REIT Per Share Merger
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option ("
_REIT Option Merger Consideration_ "). If the exercise price per share of any
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the REIT Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment
being made in respect thereof. As of the REIT Merger Effective Time, each
holder of the Company Options shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the REIT Option Merger Consideration
related to the applicable Company Option. No portion of the REIT Option Merger
Consideration shall be paid with respect to a Company Option later than the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date, with any amount not paid by the
fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing Date being forfeited to the extent
required under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(b) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the holders of any certificates
evidencing Company Restricted Shares shall have delivered, or shall have
caused to be delivered, to the Company such certificates (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof and, if required by Parent, the posting by such holder of a
bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may reasonably direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such certificate
evidencing Company Restricted Shares), each duly endorsed in blank or
accompanied by stock powers or other instruments of transfer, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, duly executed in blank.
Immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, all Company Restricted
Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time (whether or not then vested or subject to any performance condition that
has not been satisfied or performance period that has not lapsed) shall
automatically become fully vested (which, for

 



       
 

 



 

Company Restricted Shares subject to performance conditions, shall mean fully
vested in accordance with, and shall include any additional Company Restricted
Shares issued upon performance in excess of "target" level in accordance with,
the terms of the applicable award agreement or Company Equity Incentive Plan
governing such awards) and all restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse.
At the REIT Merger Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share that will
vest, or become issued and vest, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable award agreement, Company Equity Incentive Plan or the terms hereof
(which includes for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation (i) any
Company Restricted Shares issued upon performance in excess of "target" level
in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement or Company
Equity Incentive Plan governing such awards, and (ii) Company Restricted
Shares issued upon conversion of a Company Look-Back LTI Award in accordance
with _Section 3.3(c)_) shall be considered (to the extent that such Company
Restricted Share is not otherwise considered to be outstanding) an outstanding
Company Common Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right
to receive the REIT Per Share Merger Consideration (the aggregate REIT Per
Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company Restricted
Shares, the " _REIT Restricted Share Merger Consideration_ "). As of the REIT
Merger Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the REIT Per
Share Merger Consideration for each Company Restricted Share, subject to
_Section 3.3(e)_, and the certificates evidencing Company Restricted Shares
so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled and have no further force or
effect.

 



 

(c) Immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, each Company Look-
Back LTI Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time shall automatically become earned (with the portion thereof
that is subject to the achievement of performance-based metrics becoming
earned at the greater of the target award or actual performance, measured as
of immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time) and shall be converted
into a number of fully vested Company Restricted Shares, equal to the dollar
amount of such earned Company Look-Back LTI Award divided by the REIT Per
Share Merger Consideration. At the REIT Merger Effective Time, each such fully
vested Company Restricted Share shall be considered an outstanding Company
Restricted Share for all purposes of this Agreement, including the right to
receive the REIT Per Share Merger Consideration. As of the REIT Merger
Effective Time, each holder of a Company Look-Back LTI Award shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the REIT Per
Share Merger Consideration, subject to _Section 3.3(e)_, for each such fully
vested Company Restricted Share into which such Company Look-Back LTI Award
was converted.

 



 

(d) As of the REIT Merger Effective Time, each holder of Company Restricted
Shares that become fully vested, or issued and vested, in accordance with this
_Section 3.3_ shall be entitled to receive a cash lump sum payment equal to
the sum of any cash dividends and other distributions paid from the applicable
date of grant of such Company Restricted Shares (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, for any shares issued immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time, shall mean the date of the applicable award) to immediately prior to the
REIT Merger Effective Time with respect to the total number of Company
Restricted Shares that become fully vested or issued and vested as of
immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time (but including only those
dividends and other distributions which have not previously been distributed
to the holder), which dividends or other distributions shall, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent not vested, automatically become fully vested in accordance with the
terms of the applicable award agreement governing such Company Restricted
Shares (" _Restricted Share Accrued Dividends_ ").

 



 

(e) At or immediately after the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause
to be deposited with the Partnership Surviving Entity the Share Award Payments
for the benefit of the former holders of the Company Equity Awards and the
Company Look-Back LTI Awards. Promptly after the REIT Merger Effective Time
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days after the REIT Merger
Effective Time), the Partnership Surviving Entity shall pay to each of the
former holders of the Company Equity Awards or the Company Look-Back LTI
Awards, as applicable, the applicable amount of the Share Award Payments
payable to such holder pursuant to this _Section 3.3_.

 



 

 _Section 3.4_ _Company ESPP_. The Company shall, prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time, take all actions necessary to terminate the Company ESPP and
all outstanding rights thereunder as of immediately prior to the REIT Merger
Effective Time; _provided_ , that from and after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall take all actions necessary: (a) to ensure that participants
in the Company ESPP (" _ESPP Participants_ ") may not increase their payroll
deductions under the Company ESPP from those in effect on the date of this
Agreement; (b) to ensure that no new ESPP Participants may commence
participation in the Company ESPP following the date of this Agreement; (c)
not to commence a new offering period, such that the offering period in effect
as of the date of this Agreement will be the final offering period under the
Company ESPP; and (d) to provide notice to participants describing the
treatment of the Company ESPP pursuant to this _Section 3.4_. Immediately
prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, any then outstanding offering period
rights under the Company ESPP shall terminate and the Company shall distribute
to each participant in the Company ESPP all of his or her accumulated payroll
deductions with respect to the offering period then in effect (if any).

 



 

 _Section 3.5_ _Adjustment to the Merger Consideration_. If at any time
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Partnership
Merger Effective Time, any change in the issued and outstanding shares of
beneficial interest of the Company or Company Partnership Units, or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of beneficial
interest of the Company or Company Partnership Units, occurs as a result of
any merger, business combination, reclassification, recapitalization, share
split (including a reverse share split) or subdivision or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any share dividend or other share
distribution with a record date during such period, the REIT Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Share Award Payments and the Partnership Per Share Merger
Consideration will be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such
change, except that nothing in this _Section 3.5_ will be construed to permit
the Company or Company LP to take any action with respect to shares of
beneficial interest of the Company or Company Partnership Units, as
applicable, that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 _Section 3.6_ _Payment Fund; Paying Agent_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy Statement, Parent will designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as a paying agent
in the Mergers (the " _Paying Agent_ "), and the Paying Agent will administer
the payments of REIT Merger

and _Section 3.2_, respectively, with the REIT Surviving Entity administering
the payments of Share Award Payments pursuant to _Section 3.3_.

(c) At or before the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available

Paying Agent, the " _Payment Fund_ "), in each case, for the sole benefit of
the holders of the Company Common Shares and the Cash-Out Limited Partners.
Parent, the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity shall
cause the Paying Agent to make, and the Paying Agent shall make, delivery of
the REIT Merger Consideration and the Partnership Merger Consideration out of
the Payment Fund in accordance with this Agreement. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Share Award Payments are not part of the Payment Fund and shall be
deposited by Parent with the Partnership Surviving Entity and paid by the
Partnership Surviving Entity in accordance with _Section 3.3(e)_. The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

 



 

(d) The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent, on behalf of the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving
Entity, provided that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct
short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the United States of America in investment-grade
commercial paper obligations, and that no such investment or loss thereon will
affect the amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Shares and the
Cash-Out Limited Partners pursuant to this _Article 3_. Interest and other
income on the Payment Fund shall be the sole and exclusive property of the
REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity and shall be paid
to the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity. No
investment of the Payment Fund shall relieve Parent, the REIT Surviving
Entity, the Partnership Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article 3_, and following any losses from any such
investment, Parent, the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving
Entity shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent to the
extent necessary to satisfy the REIT Surviving Entitys and the Partnership
Surviving Entitys obligations hereunder for the benefit of the holders of the
Company Common Shares and the Cash-Out Limited Partners, which additional
funds will be deemed to be part of the Payment Fund.

three (3) Business Days after the REIT Merger Effective Time), Parent and the
REIT Surviving Entity shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a Company Share Certificate or Book-Entry Share immediately prior to
the REIT Merger Effective Time (other than holders of Company Restricted

be deemed, at any time after the REIT Merger Effective Time, to represent only
the right to receive, upon such surrender, the REIT Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article 3_. No interest will be paid
or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Company Share Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on any of the REIT Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of such Company Share Certificates or transfer of such Book-Entry
Shares.

 



 

(g) Promptly after the Partnership Merger Effective Time (but in any event

lieu thereof in accordance with _Section 3.8_) or transfer of any Book-Entry

therefor the Partnership Per Unit Merger Consideration, by mail or by wire
transfer, for each Company Partnership Unit formerly represented by such
Partnership Unit Certificate or Book-Entry Unit pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article 3_. After the Paying Agents receipt of such Partnership Unit
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with _Section
3.8_) or Book-Entry Unit, the Partnership Unit Certificate or Book-Entry Unit
so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled, and promptly after such surrender
or transfer, Parent and the Partnership Surviving Entity shall cause the

any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item

aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) The Company has established and maintains a system of "internal control
over financial reporting" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance (i) regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, (ii) that receipts
and expenditures of the Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of Company management and

and each of the Company Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect
on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation of such internal control over financial
reporting prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys auditors and
the audit committee of the Company Board and in _Section 4.7(f)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (x) any significant deficiency and material weakness
in the design or operation of the Companys internal control over financial
reporting that is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability
to record, process, summarize or report financial information, and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves Company management or other
employees of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary who have a
significant role in the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of
the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect

 



      
 

 



 

to such reports. The Companys management has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Company SEC
Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment thereto,

procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation.

Company Subsidiaries is in default or violation of any term, condition or

 _Section 4.12_ _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company, Company LP and each Company Subsidiary has timely
filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority all material Tax Returns
required to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time within which

each Company Subsidiary has duly paid (or there has been paid on their
behalf), or made adequate provisions in accordance with GAAP for, all material
Taxes required to be paid by them, whether or not shown on any Tax Return.
With respect to all taxable periods ending on or after December 31, 2013, the
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of all U.S.
federal and state income Tax Returns and all other material Tax Returns of the

(b) Each of the Company and VEF 500 First REIT LP (the " _REIT Subsidiary_ ")

Subsidiary, December 31, 2010, and through its taxable year ended December 31,
2016, has been subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within
the meaning of Sections 856 through 860 of the Code (a " _REIT_ ") and has
satisfied all requirements to qualify, and has qualified, as a REIT for such
years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2017 and will operate to the day of
the REIT Merger in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT; (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner
as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year that will end on the day of the
REIT Merger; and (iv) has not taken or omitted to take any action that could
reasonably be expected to result in a challenge by the IRS or any other
Governmental Authority to its status as a REIT, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, no such challenge is pending or threatened; _provided_ , _however_ ,
the qualification of each of the Company and the REIT Subsidiary as a REIT for
its taxable year that will end on, in the case of the Company, the day of the
REIT Merger, and in the case of the REIT Subsidiary, through December 31, 2017
(or applicable earlier date), assumes that the Parent will continue to operate
the REIT Subsidiary after the Closing Date in a manner to qualify as a REIT
for its taxable year that will end on December 31, 2017 (or such earlier date
on which the REIT Subsidiary is terminated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes by liquidation or by merger with another entity after the Closing
Date). No Company Subsidiary (including any subsidiary of the REIT Subsidiary)
is a corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, other than (i) a
corporation that qualifies as a REIT, (ii) a corporation that qualifies as a
"qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the

of the Code (each, a " _Taxable REIT Subsidiary_ ").

 



 

(c) (i) There are no audits, investigations by any Governmental Authority or
other proceedings ongoing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened with
regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company, Company LP or any
Company Subsidiary; (ii) no material deficiency for Taxes of the Company,
Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has been claimed, proposed or assessed in
writing or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, by any Governmental
Authority, which deficiency has not yet been settled except for such
deficiencies which are being contested in good faith or with respect to which
the failure to pay, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the Company,
Company LP nor any Company Subsidiary has waived any statute of limitations
with respect to the assessment of material Taxes or agreed to

 



      
 

 



 

any extension of time with respect to any material Tax assessment or
deficiency for any open tax year; (iv) no Governmental Authority in any
jurisdiction in which any of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary
does not file Tax Returns has claimed in writing that the Company, Company LP
or such Company Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by such
jurisdiction; and (v) neither the Company, Company LP nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or
foreign income Tax Law).

 



 

(d) Each Company Subsidiary other than the REIT Subsidiary that is a
partnership, joint venture or limited liability company and that has not
elected to be a Taxable REIT Subsidiary has been since its formation treated
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as a partnership, disregarded entity, or
Qualified REIT Subsidiary, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an
association taxable as a corporation whose separate existence is respected for
U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the due date thereof
under all applicable Laws.

 



 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section 4.12(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there are no Company Tax Protection Agreements in force on the date of
this Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no Person has raised in

guaranteed, indemnified or assumed debt of a Company Subsidiary Partnership;
and/or (iv) the general partner or manager of a Company Subsidiary Partnership

member or other beneficial owner of such Company Subsidiary Partnership in
connection with any transaction or other action. As used herein, " _Company
Subsidiary Partnership_ " means each of Company LP and any Company Subsidiary
that is a partnership for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

 



 

(h) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of the Company, Company
LP or any Company Subsidiary, except (i) Liens for Taxes not yet due and
payable or that are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and for which adequate reserves have been established in accordance with GAAP

member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated U.S. federal income Tax
Return or (ii) has any liability for the Taxes of any Person (other than the

(m) None of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code), a "successor" to a "distributing
corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7T(f)(2)) or a member of a "separate affiliated
group" of a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (all
within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code), in a distribution of shares
qualifying for tax-free treatment under Sections 355 or 356 of the Code (i) in
the two (2) years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a

(p) With respect to the Companys taxable year ending with the REIT Merger,
taking into account, without limitation, all distributions to be made by the

 **ARTICLE 7 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

 _Section 7.1_ _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and cause to be filed with the SEC the
Proxy Statement in preliminary form. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mail or deliver the definitive Proxy Statement to its
shareholders entitled to vote at the Company Shareholder Meeting as promptly
as reasonably practicable following clearance from SEC. Parent shall furnish
all information concerning itself, its Affiliates and the holders of its
capital stock to the Company and provide such other assistance as may be
reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the preparation, filing
and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or any request from the
SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide Parent with copies of
all correspondence between it and

 



      
 

 



 

its Representatives, on one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand, and all
written comments with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the SEC and
advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement
received from the SEC. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC with
respect to the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing
or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or
filing any other document to be filed by the Company with the SEC in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall cooperate and provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final version
of such document or response), which comments the Company shall consider in
good faith.

 



 

(b) If, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval,
any information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company or Parent, should be set forth in an
amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto, and
the Company and Parent shall cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of
any necessary amendment of, or supplement to, the Proxy Statement and, to the
extent required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such
amendment or supplement to shareholders of the Company. Nothing in this
_Section 7.1(b)_ shall limit the obligations of any Party under _Section
7.1(a)_. For purposes of _Section 4.15_, _Section 5.5_ and this _Section
7.1_, any information concerning or related to the Company, its Affiliates or
the Company Shareholder Meeting will be deemed to have been provided by the
Company, and any information concerning or related to Parent or its Affiliates
will be deemed to have been provided by Parent.

 



 

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date that the Proxy
Statement is cleared by the SEC, the Company shall, in accordance with
applicable Law, the rules of the NYSE and the Company Declaration and the
Company Bylaws, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ , that such
record date shall not be more than ninety (90) days prior to the established
date of the Company Shareholder Meeting. The Company shall, through the
Company Board, recommend to its shareholders that they provide the Company
Shareholder Approval, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
solicit and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section 7.3_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 7.1(c)_, if, on a
date for which the Company Shareholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has
not received proxies representing a sufficient number of Company Common Shares
to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is
present, the Company shall have the right to make one or more successive
postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholder Meeting (solely for
the purpose of and for the times reasonably necessary to solicit additional
proxies and votes in favor of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby); _provided_ , that the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholder Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is less than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Outside Date.

 



 

 _Section 7.2_ _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Company and Company LP shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
to, afford Parent and its Representatives reasonable access (including for the
purpose of transition) during normal business hours and upon reasonable
advance notice to all of their respective properties, offices, books,
contracts, commitments, personnel and records, and their respective counsel
and other Representatives, and, during such period, the Company and Company LP
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, furnish reasonably
promptly to Parent and its Representatives (i) a copy of each report,
schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws, and
(ii) all other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request, subject to any
privacy protections with respect to information concerning personnel as may be
required by applicable Law. No representation or warranty as to the accuracy
of information provided pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_ is made, and Parent
may not rely on the accuracy of such information except to the extent
expressly set forth in the representations and warranties included in _Article
4_, and no investigation under this _Section 7.2(a)_ or otherwise shall
affect any of the representations and warranties of the Company or Company LP
contained in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor
Company LP shall be required by this _Section 7.2(a)_ to provide Parent or
its Representatives with access to or to disclose information (A) that is
subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement in favor of a third party
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement, (B) the disclosure of which
would violate any Law or legal duty applicable to the Company, Company LP or
any of their Representatives ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of Law or legal duty), or (C)
that is subject to any attorney-client, attorney work product or other legal
privilege or would cause a risk of loss of privilege to the Company, Company
LP or the Company Subsidiaries ( _provided_ that the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow for access or disclosure to the
extent that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or other
legal privilege). Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
minimize any disruption to the businesses of the Company, Company LP and the
Company Subsidiaries that may result from the requests for access, data and
information hereunder. Prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives and Affiliates not
to, contact or otherwise communicate with parties with which the Company,
Company LP or any Company Subsidiary has a business relationship (including
tenants/subtenants) regarding the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the Company which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned (
_provided_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this _Section
7.2(a)_ shall be deemed to restrict Parent and its Representatives and
Affiliates from contacting such parties in the ordinary course of Parents
business).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Unless and until the Closing occurs, Parent will hold, and will cause its
Representatives and Affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information, including
any information exchanged pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, in confidence to
the extent required by and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with,
the terms of the Nondisclosure Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect pursuant to the terms thereof notwithstanding the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the termination thereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 7.2_, Parent and its
Affiliates and Representatives may disclose to Financing Sources and their
Representatives, and Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives and
Financing Sources and their Representatives may use, any such information
regarding the Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries and their
business, this Agreement, the Mergers, the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and documents related thereto, and the Company shall, and shall
cause each of Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries to, afford any Financing
Sources and their Representatives access to the Companys, Company LPs and
Company Subsidiaries properties, offices, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and officers, accountants, managers employees, counsel
and other Representatives as described in _Section 7.2(a)_, in each case, in
connection with any Financing, including as part of the due diligence
investigation by Financing Sources and their Representatives, for preparation
of Offering Materials, and during syndication or marketing of any Financing;
_provided_ , _however_ , in each case, that (x) such disclosure and use shall
be subject to and shall not violate of the terms of the Nondisclosure
Agreement (as may be amended to accommodate such disclosure and use, or as
such disclosure and use maybe expressly consented to by the Company in
accordance with the terms of the Nondisclosure Agreement) and Parent shall be
liable for any breach of the Nondisclosure Agreement by Parent or any of its
Representatives to the same extent as if the breach had been committed
directly by Parent (unless such Financing Sources shall have entered into a
separate nondisclosure agreement with the Company or any of its Affiliates),
and (y) such Financing Sources shall first have entered into customary
confidentiality undertakings with respect to such information regarding the
Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries and their business, this
Agreement, the Mergers, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and documents related thereto (which may include through a notice and deemed
undertaking in a form customarily used in Offering Materials).

 



 

 _Section 7.3_ _No Solicitation; Company Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.3_, during the Interim
Period, the Company and Company LP shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, and shall not authorize or permit any Representatives of
the Company, Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, proposal
or offer with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that is reasonably likely to lead to any Company Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate or engage in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person other than
Parent or its Representatives any non-public information or data with respect
to, any Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement, share exchange agreement, consolidation agreement, option
agreement or other similar definitive agreement (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) in each case

 



      
 

 



 

related to a Company Acquisition Proposal (each, a " _Company Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv) agree to or propose publicly to do any of
the foregoing. Each of the Company and Company LP shall, and shall cause each
of the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause their respective Representatives to, (A) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing negotiations with any Person and its
Representatives (other than Parent or any of its Representatives) conducted
heretofore with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, and (B) request
the prompt return or destruction, to the extent required by any
confidentiality agreement, of all confidential information previously
furnished to any such Person and its Representatives. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company and Company LP may terminate,
waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any standstill agreement
(including any standstill provisions contained in any confidentiality or other
agreement) to which it or any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party,
if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys legal advisors) that a failure to take such action with respect to
such standstill agreement would be inconsistent with its duties under
applicable Law, and it is understood and agreed that each of the Company and
Company LP by execution of this Agreement shall be deemed to have waived
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement any provision in any such
agreement to the extent necessary (and only to such extent) to enable such
counterparty to convey confidentially a Company Acquisition Proposal to the
Company Board.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 7.3(a)_, if, at any
time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the Company
Shareholder Approval, (i) the Company or Company LP receives a written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona
fide, (ii) such Company Acquisition Proposal was not the result of a violation
of this _Section 7.3_, and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Companys legal and financial advisors) that such
Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, and (after consultation with the Companys legal
advisors) that a failure to take action with respect to such Company
Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable
Law, then the Company and Company LP may (and may authorize the Company
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to) (x) furnish, make available
or provide access to non-public information with respect to the Company,
Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that any non-public information
provided to any Person given such access shall have previously been provided
to Parent or shall be provided (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to
such Person, and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons
Representatives) regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company, Company LP and its
Representatives may contact any Person submitting a Company Acquisition
Proposal (that was not the result of a violation of this _Section 7.3_) to
clarify and understand the terms of a Company Acquisition Proposal and to
determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement, in the event the Company,
Company LP or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
Representatives receives

 



      
 

 



 

from a Person or group of related Persons (i) a Company Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company, Company
LP or the Company Subsidiaries from a Person who informs the Company, Company
LP or any Company Subsidiary that it is considering making or has made a
Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions
or negotiations regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of (but in no event more than two (2) Business Days
following) such receipt, which shall identify the Person making the Company
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and shall include a copy of such
Company Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request or, if not made in writing, a
written description of the material terms thereof. The Company shall not
provide any information to or engage in discussions or negotiations with the
Person making the Company Acquisition Proposal until such notice has been
given and shall keep Parent apprised in all material respects on a timely
basis as to the status (including, within two (2) Business Days after the
occurrence of any material amendment or modification) of, any such Company
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, including by furnishing copies of
any documentation that supplements or amends any such Company Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request in any material respect. Copies of documents
provided to Parent pursuant to this paragraph may be redacted as necessary to
protect the confidential information of the proposing Person.

 



 

(d) Except as provided in _Sections 7.3(e)_ and _7.3(f)_ , the Company Board
(i)(A) shall not fail to make and shall not withdraw (or modify or qualify in
any manner adverse to Parent or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify in any manner adverse to Parent) the approval, recommendation or
declaration of advisability by the Company Board of this Agreement, the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (B) shall not
adopt, approve or publicly recommend the adoption of any Company Acquisition
Proposal (each such action set forth in this _Section 7.3(d)(i)_ being
referred to herein as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), and (ii)
shall not cause or permit the Company, Company LP or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to enter into any Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement
relating to any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,

 



 

(i) the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
authorize, cause or permit the Company, Company LP or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to, and the Company, Company LP or any of the Company
Subsidiaries may, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_
and promptly thereafter enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement
with respect to a Company Superior Proposal, if (i) the Company or Company LP
receives a written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
believes in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) such Company Acquisition Proposal
was not the result of a violation of _Section 7.3(a)_, (iii) the Company
Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys legal
and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, and (D) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
legal advisors), that the failure to terminate this Agreement or make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its duties
under applicable Law; and

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) in circumstances not involving a Company Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Board may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, and only
if, after the date of this Agreement, the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Companys legal advisors) that (A) a
Company Intervening Event has occurred or arisen, and (B) the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) The Company Board shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement or
effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted under _Section
7.3(e)_ unless, prior to taking such action, (i) the Company has notified
Parent in writing that it intends to so terminate this Agreement and enter
into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement, attaching the most current
version of such agreement (including any amendments, supplements or
notifications), or effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change specifying
in reasonable detail the reasons therefor (such notice, a " _Change Notice_
"); and (ii) during the four (4) Business Day period following Parents
receipt of a Change Notice, the Company shall have offered to negotiate with
(and, if accepted, negotiated in good faith with), and shall have caused its
respective financial and legal advisors to offer to negotiate with (and if
accepted, negotiated in good faith with), Parent in making adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement such that, (x) in circumstances
involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, the related Company
Superior Proposal ceases to be a Company Superior Proposal, or (y) in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal,
such terms are as Parent proposes; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any
amendment, supplement or modification to the financial or any other material
terms of any Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed a new Company
Acquisition Proposal and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_ or make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ unless the Company has complied with the
requirements of this _Section 7.3(f)_ with respect to each such new Company
Acquisition Proposal, including sending a Change Notice with respect to such
Company Acquisition Proposal, provided that the Company shall be obligated to
negotiate for a period of only three (3) Business Days from such new Change
Notice, and (iii) following the end of the four (4) Business Day period or
three (3) Business Day period (as applicable) contemplated by the immediately
preceding subclause (ii), the Company Board determines, in good faith that (x)
following consultation with the Companys legal and financial advisors in
circumstances involving or relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal, the
Company Superior Proposal giving rise to the Change Notice continues to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal (taking into account modifications or
amendments to this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such Change
Notice) and (y) in any case, following consultation with the Companys legal
advisors, the failure to make such Company Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board through its Representatives,
directly or indirectly, from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act pending
disclosure of its position thereunder or taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), or making a statement
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board (after consultation with its legal advisors), failure to so disclose

 _Section 7.5_ _Indemnification; Trustees , Directors and Officers

(a) From the REIT Merger Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the REIT Merger Effective Time, without limiting any additional
rights that any director, officer, trustee, or agent may have under any
indemnification agreement or under the Organizational Documents of the
Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary in effect as of the date hereof,
each of the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity, shall
jointly and severally: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each Person who is at

authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in
connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement

and the REIT Surviving Entitys receipt of a written undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is
ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ , that the Partnership Surviving Entity
and the REIT Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any amounts paid in
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) and shall not be obligated
to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality
of the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim (except to the extent the
Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that such Indemnified Party has
conflicting interests with one or more other Indemnified Parties in the
outcome of such action (in which event such Indemnified Party shall be

Surviving Entity shall be liable). The indemnification and advancement
obligations of the Partnership Surviving Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity
pursuant to this _Section 7.5(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring

or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the
Mergers and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all
rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue
as to a Person who has ceased to be a director, officer, trustee, or agent of
the Company or Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries after the date
hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Persons heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.5(a)_, (A) the

whether instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any
other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,

believes might lead to the institution of any Action arising out of or
pertaining to (x) matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or
service as a director, officer, trustee or agent of the Company, Company LP,
any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the extent such Person is or was
serving at the request or for the benefit of the Company, Company LP or any of

investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on
appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate
in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this
_Section 7.5(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. The
Partnership Surviving Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity, as applicable,
shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
actual or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought
by an Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or
judgment includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Claim, or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents thereto in writing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent, the Partnership Surviving
Entity and the REIT Surviving Entity agrees that all rights to indemnification
and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Closing now existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in
the Organizational Documents and indemnification agreements of the Company,
Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period
of six (6) years following the Closing, the organizational documents of the
Partnership Surviving Entity, the REIT Surviving Entity and any applicable
Company Subsidiary shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification and limitations on liability of trustees, directors, officers
or agents than as set forth in the Organizational Documents of each of the
Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, as applicable, Parent,
the Partnership Surviving Entity or the REIT Surviving Entity shall maintain
in effect the Companys current trustees and officers liability insurance
covering each Person currently covered by the Companys trustees, directors
and officers liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior
to and through the Closing; _provided_ , that in lieu of such obligation, (i)
Parent, the REIT Surviving Entity or the Partnership Surviving Entity, as
applicable, may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the
same or better rating as the Companys and Company LPs current insurance
carrier the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such trustees, directors and
officers than the Companys, Company LPs or the applicable Company
Subsidiarys existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) in consultation
with Parent, the Company may obtain extended reporting period coverage under
the Companys, Company LPs or the applicable Company Subsidiarys existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Closing) or purchase a "tail"
policy for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, as applicable, for a
cost not in excess of three (3) times the current annual premiums for such
insurance; and provided, further, that in no event shall the REIT Surviving
Entity or the Partnership Surviving Entity be required to pay annual premiums
for insurance under this _Section 7.5(c)_ in excess of 300% of the most
recent annual premiums paid by the Company, Company LP or the applicable
Company Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement for
such purpose, it being understood that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the REIT Surviving Entity or the
Partnership Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall nevertheless be obligated
to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 300% amount.

 



 

(d) If the REIT Surviving Entity, the Partnership Surviving Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or
(ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the REIT Surviving Entity or the Partnership Surviving Entity, as
the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
7.5_.

 



 

(e) Parent, the REIT Surviving Entity and the Partnership Surviving Entity
shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that
may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided in this _Section 7.5_; _provided_ , that such
Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is
determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under
Law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are intended to be for the express
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are
intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_), his or her heirs
and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Company, Company LP, the REIT Surviving Entity and
the Partnership Surviving Entity and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and
heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (including
such successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and
indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.5_ shall not be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

 



 

 _Section 7.6_ _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company, Company LP and Parent shall, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries, REIT Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub and the Parent
Subsidiaries, respectively, and their respective Affiliates to, use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
Party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
or pursuant to any contract or agreement to consummate and make effective, as

waiting period expirations or terminations, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities or other Persons necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the making of all necessary or advisable registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the
taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary or advisable to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an Action by, any Governmental Authority
or other Persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including complying
expeditiously with any and all information and document requests by any
Governmental Authority in connection with any investigation of the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) subject to _Section
7.7(c)_, the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including seeking to have any stay or restraining order entered by any court
or other Governmental Authority vacated or reversed, and the avoidance of each
and every impediment under any antitrust, merger control, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably
possible, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary or advisable to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this

reasonable efforts (or shall cause REIT Merger Sub, Partnership Merger Sub,
the Parent Subsidiaries or the Company Subsidiaries, respectively), to give
any notices to third parties, and each of Parent and the Company shall use,
and cause each of their respective Affiliates to use, its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by _Section

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties
hereto shall and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a
Governmental Authority, including promptly informing the other Parties of such
inquiry, consulting in advance before

 



      
 

 



 

making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and
supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or
communications between any Party and any Governmental Authority with respect
to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable and legally permitted,
the Parties or their Representatives shall have the right to review in
advance, and each of the Parties will consult the others on, all the
information relating to such parties and each of their Affiliates that appears
in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that confidential, competitively
sensitive business information may be redacted from such exchanges. The

only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, directors or trustees of the recipient

obligation to such Person prior to the Partnership Merger Effective Time and
the REIT Merger Effective Time. The Parties shall cooperate with respect to
accommodations that may be requested to obtain such consents.

contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company, Company LP and their respective Representatives shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt

be incapable of being satisfied by the Outside Date, or (ii) it fails to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be

and their respective Representatives shall give prompt notice to Parent, and
Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt notice to the Company and
Company LP, if, to the Knowledge of the Company or the Knowledge of Parent, as
applicable, the occurrence of any state of facts, change, development, event
or condition would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any of the
conditions to Closing set forth herein not to be satisfied or satisfaction to
be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the failure by the Company, Company LP, Parent or their respective
Representatives to provide such prompt notice under this _Section 7.7(b)_
shall not constitute a breach of covenant for purposes of _Section 8.2(b)_,
_Section 8.3(b)_ or _Section 9.3(b)(i)_.

 



 

(c) The Company, Company LP and their respective Representatives shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent and its Representatives shall give prompt

LP and their respective Representatives shall give Parent the opportunity to
reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any shareholder

and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). Parent and its Representatives shall give the Company and Company LP
the opportunity to reasonably participate in the defense and settlement of any
litigation against Parent and/or its directors relating to this Agreement, the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

take all such steps to cause any dispositions of Company Common Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each Person

the Company Common Shares or the Company Partnership Units permitted under the
terms of this Agreement has a record date prior to the REIT Merger Effective
Time or Partnership Merger Effective Time, as applicable, and has not been

reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Mergers or any of the other

Statute is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action
necessary so that the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Statute on the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 _Section 7.15_ _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) The Company, Company LP and each Company Subsidiary (as applicable) shall
terminate the employment of each employee of the Company, Company LP or any
Company Subsidiary, excluding any such employee with a Company Employment
Agreement with respect to the Company Employment Agreements set forth on
_Section 7.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter (which shall be governed
by _Section 7.15(b)_), effective immediately prior to the Closing. With
respect to any such employee of the Company, Company LP or any Company
Subsidiary as to whom The RMR Group LLC, a Maryland limited liability company
(" _RMR LLC_ "), prior to the Closing, does not offer comparable employment
with comparable compensation for a position with comparable responsibilities
at or within fifty (50) miles of such employees primary location of work as
of immediately prior to the Closing, Parent will cause the Partnership
Surviving Entity to pay each such employee the severance benefits that such
employee is eligible to receive, calculated pursuant to the formula set forth
in the Company Severance Guidelines, effective June 13, 2016 (the " _Severance
Guidelines_ ") in accordance with such Severance Guidelines (regardless of any
discretionary right on the part of the Company to pay or not pay such amounts
under the Severance Guidelines).

 



 

(b) Effective as of the Closing, the employment of each employee of the
Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary who is a party to a Company
Employment Agreement set forth in _Section 7.15(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be terminated

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to the terms thereof. From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall,
and shall cause the REIT Surviving Entity, the Partnership Surviving Entity or
their respective Affiliates to, honor the terms of such Company Employment
Agreements, including the payment of amounts or other benefits to which such
employees are entitled in connection with such termination (which payment, for
the avoidance of doubt, will be calculated with such termination being deemed
to have occurred within the "Change in Control Protection Period" under each
of the Company Employment Agreement), subject in each case to such employees
compliance with the provisions of the Company Employment Agreements applicable
to such employee.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing, Parent may request RMR LLC to offer "at will"
employment to some or all of the property level employees of the Company,
Company LP or any Company Subsidiary. The Company and Company LP shall, and
shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, provide RMR LLC with reasonable
access to any and all of their employees to permit RMR LLC, at its discretion,
to discuss offers of employment with any such employees and the terms of any
associated employment related documents, and to cooperate with RMR LLC in the
transitioning of any such employees to be employees of RMR LLC as of the
Closing Date.

 



 

(d) Parent shall cause RMR LLC to credit each employee of the Company, Company
LP or any Company Subsidiary hired by RMR LLC with his or her years of service
with the Company, Company LP and any of the Company Subsidiaries and their
respective Affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor
employer) before the Closing for purposes of eligibility, severance, waiting
periods, vesting and determination of level of benefits under the compensation
and benefit plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of RMR LLC and any of
its subsidiaries or Affiliates providing benefits to any employees hired by
RMR LLC after the Closing (collectively, the " _New Plans_ "), including for
purposes of accrual of vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits
under New Plans (but excluding any New Plan that is a defined benefit pension
plan or that is established after the Closing or that does not recognize
service prior to its adoption), to the same extent as such employee was
entitled, before the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar
Company Benefit Plan, except where such credit would result in a duplication
of benefits. In addition, to the extent permitted under the New Plans, Parent
shall cause RMR LLC to use commercially reasonable efforts, but without cost
to RMR LLC and without a potential for a resulting increase in the cost of or
rates under the New Plans, to cause any eligible expenses incurred by any
employee of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary hired by RMR LLC
and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan during the
portion of the plan year prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
of the New Plan as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New
Plan.

 



 

(e) At or immediately after the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent shall pay,
or shall cause the REIT Surviving Entity, the Partnership Surviving Entity or
their respective

 



       
 

 



 

Affiliates to pay, to each individual who, prior to the Closing Date, was an
employee of the Company, Company LP or any Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
(i) if the Closing Date occurs before December 31, 2017, a pro-rata portion of
any annual cash incentive in respect of the Companys 2017 fiscal year in an
amount equal to the product of (x) the amount that such employee would have
been entitled to receive under the Companys applicable annual incentive bonus
program, based on the target level of achievement under such program and (y) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the current fiscal
year through the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is 365; or (ii) if
the Closing Date occurs on or after December 31, 2017, an amount equal to any
unpaid annual cash incentive in respect of the Companys 2017 fiscal year that
such employee earned (i.e., is entitled to receive) under the Companys
applicable annual incentive bonus program (based on actual achievement for
such fiscal year as determined by the Company Board).

 



 

(f) The Company or Company LP, as applicable, shall, no later than ten (10)
days prior to the Closing Date, adopt resolutions of the Company or Company
LP, as applicable, Board (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be

Subsidiaries to, and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective Representatives to, provide all cooperation reasonably requested by

confidential information memoranda, private placement memoranda, registration
statements, prospectuses and supplements thereto and offering documents
otherwise customary for such Financing (collectively, the " _Offering
Materials_ ") and roadshows and other customary marketing materials to be used
in connection with such Financing reasonably deemed necessary by such
Financing Sources to complete a successful syndication or offering of such
Financing or otherwise in connection with such Financing, including customary

confidential information memorandum does not include any material non-public
information with respect to the Company, Company LP and the Company
Subsidiaries, and participating (including the participation of Company
Representatives) in reasonable due diligence sessions and informational
meetings with Parent, any Financing Sources (including potential Financing
Sources) and their respective Representatives related to any Financing; (iii)
causing the Companys, Company LPs and Company Subsidiaries (as applicable)
independent auditors to reasonably cooperate with respect to any Financing
consistent with customary practice, including by providing customary "comfort

(including customary "negative assurances" and pro forma financial statement
comfort) and customary assistance with the due diligence activities of Parent
and any Financing Sources, and customary consents to the inclusion of audit

be used in connection with any Financing, provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company, Company LP or the Company Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company, Company LP or the Company Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 7.17(b)_ or any
other provisions of this Agreement, (A) prior to the Closing, none of the

connection with the transactions contemplated by any Financing, definitive
Financing Agreement or any certificate, document or instrument relating to any
Financing, (B) none of the Company, Company LP or any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall be required to take any action (i) under or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by any agreement, certificate, document or
instrument relating to any Financing that is not contingent upon the Closing
Date (including the entry into any agreement that is effective before the
Closing Date), (ii) that would reasonably be expected to cause any trustee,
director, officer or employee of the Company, Company LP or any of the Company
Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability relating to any Financing, (iii)
that will conflict with or violate its Organizational Documents or any
applicable Laws, or (iv) that would cause any condition to the Closing to fail

resolutions approving the agreements, documents and instruments pursuant to
which any Financing is obtained, (D) none of the Company, Company LP or any of
the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to execute any definitive Financing
documents, including any credit or other agreements, pledge or security
documents, or other certificates, legal opinions or documents in connection
with any Financing Agreements that are effective prior to the Closing, and (E)
none of the Company, Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any trust, limited partnership or limited liability company
actions that are effective prior to the Closing to permit the consummation of
any Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

None of the Company, Company LP or any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective Representatives, shall have any liability to Parent or any of
its Affiliates in respect of any financial statements, other financial
information or data or other information provided pursuant to this _Section
7.17(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in
_Section 8.2(b)_, as it applies to the Companys obligations under this
_Section 7.17(b)_ shall be deemed satisfied unless any Financing has not been
obtained primarily as a result of the Companys, Company LPs or the Company
Subsidiaries willful and material breach of its obligations under this
_Section 7.17(b)_.

 



 

(c) Parent shall, promptly upon demand by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company,
Company LP, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in
connection with the cooperation required by or requested pursuant to this

a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, Company
LP, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the arrangement of any Financing and any information utilized
in connection therewith (other than historical information related to the
Company, Company LP and the Company Subsidiaries) except to the extent finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the
Companys, Company LPs or any Company Subsidiarys fraud, gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

 



 

(d) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 7.17_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Nondisclosure Agreement, and
Parent shall be liable for any breach of this provision or the Nondisclosure
Agreement by Parent or any of its Representatives to the same extent as if the
breach had been committed directly by Parent.

 



 

(e) For purposes of clarity, the parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the consummation of all or any portion of any Financing constitute
a condition to the Closing hereunder (pursuant to _Article 8_ or otherwise).

 



 

 _Section 7.18_ _Existing Loans; Other Cooperation_. Without limiting
_Section 7.6_ or _Section 7.17_,

 



 

(a) the Parties shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause any Existing
Loans for which prepayment is permitted that Parent requests be repaid at
Closing be so repaid, and any commitments thereunder be terminated, and any
Liens or guarantees in connection therewith released (provided, any Existing
Loan secured by a Company Property that is not wholly-owned by a Company
Subsidiary may be prepaid only with the consent of the Companys joint venture
partner, if required), and (ii) obtain any consents required in connection
with any prepayment of any Existing Loan secured by a Company Property that is
not wholly-owned if requested by Parent and any consents required in
connection with the Closing under any other Existing Loans. The Company or
Company LP shall, as promptly as practicable following execution of this
Agreement, request, and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, customary
payoff letters in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Financing Sources (the " _Payoff Letters_ ") for the Existing Loans that
Parent has requested be repaid in connection with the Closing from the
applicable financial institutions;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) the Company and Company LP shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
to, each use its and their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent,
and as directed by Parent, in (i) seeking and negotiating waivers, consents or
amendments to existing contracts, agreements and other arrangements pursuant
to which the Company, Company LP or a Company Subsidiary has incurred any
Indebtedness or which govern or relate to the Unconsolidated Subsidiaries; and
(ii) negotiating with or otherwise dealing with the Outside Limited Partners
and the holders of the minority interests in the Unconsolidated Subsidiaries;
and

 



 

(c) in connection with obtaining any waivers, consents or amendments under
this _Section 7.18_ , if requested by Parent in writing, the Parties will
cooperate and work in good faith to restructure the acquisition of the Company
as a reverse merger and to make such reasonable amendments to this Agreement
as the Parties mutually agree are necessary to reflect such structure (the "
_Reverse Merger Structure_ "); provided, however, that (i) the Reverse Merger
Structure shall not delay the Closing, (ii) the Reverse Merger Structure (or
the inability to complete the Reverse Merger Structure) shall not relieve
Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub of their obligations to pay
the REIT Merger Consideration, Partnership Merger Consideration and Share
Awards at the Closing as required under this Agreement, (iii) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to engage in the Reverse
Merger Structure if it could adversely affect the classification of the
Company as, or its qualification for taxation as, a REIT, and (iv) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall be required to engage in the Reverse
Merger Structure if it would reasonably be expected to result in adverse
consequences to the shareholders or other equity interest holders of the
Company or the Company LP as a whole, that are incrementally greater or more
adverse, as the case may be, than the consequences to such parties in
connection with the consummation of this Agreement in the absence of engaging
in the Reverse Merger Structure pursuant to this _Section 7.18(c)_ unless such
holders (as a whole) are indemnified by the Parent for such incremental
consequences; and

 



 

(d) for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that
in no event shall the termination of any Existing Loans or the assumption of
any Existing Loan constitute a condition to the Closing under this Agreement
(pursuant to _Article 8_ or otherwise).

 



 

 _Section 7.19_ _Asset Sales_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent may
request that the Company and Company LP prepare to market any assets
(including any Company Property) for sale, and the Company and Company LP
shall, and shall cause the applicable Company Subsidiaries to, cooperate in
good faith with Parent in preparing to market such assets for sale and
developing a strategy and process for marketing such assets, including with
respect to identifying any notifications, authorizations, approvals or
consents required in connection therewith; _provided_ , that (i) nothing in
this Agreement shall require the Company, Company LP or a Company Subsidiary
to enter into an agreement with respect to, execute or consummate any asset
sale prior to the Closing, and (ii) none of Company, Company LP or any Company
Subsidiary shall be required to take any action in contravention of any Laws
or any of their respective Organizational Documents or any other contract or
agreement to which the Company, Company LP, the Company Subsidiaries or any of
their respective assets are bound. Upon any termination of this Agreement,
Parent shall upon request by Company reimburse the Company or Company LP all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, Company LP or the
applicable Company Subsidiaries in connection with any actions taken by
Company or Company LP at the request of Parent in accordance with this
_Section 7.19_ (including reasonable fees and expenses of their
Representatives). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event shall the Company be required to sell any of its
assets, and no asset sale shall constitute a condition to the Closing
hereunder (pursuant to _Article 8_ or otherwise).

 



 

 _Section 7.20_ _Operation of REIT Subsidiary After Closing_. After the
Closing Date and through the taxable year of the REIT Subsidiary that will end
on December 31, 2017 (or such earlier date on which the REIT Subsidiary is
terminated for U.S. federal income tax purposes by liquidation or by merger
with another entity after the Closing Date), the Parent will operate the REIT
Subsidiary in a manner to qualify as a REIT.

 



 

 _Section 7.21_ _Personal Holding Company Status._ The Parties acknowledge
that the acquisition structure described in this Agreement is based on the
assumption that the Company is not, and will not be for its taxable year
ending with the REIT Merger, a "personal holding company" within the meaning
of Section 542(a) of the Code. If either Parent or the Company reasonably
believes that, based on the Companys income and activities from January 1,
2017 through the REIT Merger Effective Time (including the U.S. federal income
Tax effects described in _Section 2.6_), the Company may be or become a
personal holding company, then if Parent so requests, the Parties will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the issue, including, as may

 



      
 

 



 

be requested by Parent, restructuring the acquisition of the Company as the
Reverse Merger Structure subject to the conditions in _Section 7.18(c)_. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
determination whether the Company is or could become a personal holding
company shall not constitute a condition to the Closing hereunder (pursuant to
_Article 8_ or otherwise).

 



 

 _Section 7.22_ _Accounting Functions_. During the Interim Period, the
Company and Company LP shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall
direct each of its employees to use commercially reasonable efforts, to
reasonably cooperate with the accounting group of RMR LLC in connection with
the transition of accounting functions with respect to the Company, Company LP
and the Company Subsidiaries to RMR LLC.

determines to enter into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to a Company Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 7.3(e)_,
and the Company pays the Company Termination Fee due under _Section 9.3_ in
accordance with _Section 9.3_.

 



 

 _Section 9.2_ _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. In the event
of termination of this Agreement as provided in _Section 9.1_, written notice
thereof shall be given to the other Party, specifying the provisions hereof
pursuant to which such termination is made and describing the basis therefor
in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have
no effect, without any liability or obligation on the part of Parent or the
Company, except that the Nondisclosure Agreement and the provisions of
_Section 7.2(b)_ (Confidentiality), _Section 7.4_ (Public Announcements),
this _Section 9.2_ (Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination), _Section
9.3_ (Fees and Expenses) and _Article 10_ (General Provisions) and the
definitions of all defined terms appearing in such sections, shall survive
such termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , that subject to _Section
10.11_, no such termination shall relieve any Party from any liability or
damages resulting from any fraud in connection with this Agreement or any
willful and intentional breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination
of this Agreement, in which case the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to
all rights and remedies available at law or in equity including, in the case
of a willful and intentional breach by Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership
Merger Sub, liability to the Company for damages, determined taking into
account all relevant factors, including damages to the Companys shareholders
to the extent awarded by the applicable court. For purposes of this Agreement,
" _willful and intentional breach_ " means a material breach that is a
consequence of an act knowingly undertaken by the breaching Party with the
intent of causing a breach of this Agreement (it being understood that the
failure of the Company or Company LP, on the one hand, or Parent, REIT Merger
Sub or Partnership Merger Sub, on the other hand, to consummate the Mergers
when required under the terms of this Agreement (and in the case of Parent,
REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub, regardless of whether any of such
entities has obtained or received the proceeds of any Financing) will
constitute a willful and intentional breach.

 



 

 _Section 9.3_ _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 9.3_, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated

 



       
 

 



 

hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or
not the Mergers are consummated.

 



 

(b) In the event that:

 



 

(i) (A)(x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(i)_, and after the date hereof and prior to the breach giving rise to
such right of termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal (with, for all
purposes of this _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, all percentages included in the
definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" increased to 67%) has been
publicly announced, disclosed or otherwise communicated to the Company Board,
or (y) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, and prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, a
Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced, disclosed or
otherwise communicated to the Companys shareholders, and (B) within twelve
(12) months after the date of such termination, a transaction in respect of a
Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated or the Company enters into a
Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement in respect of a Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) that is later
consummated;

 



 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_;
or

 



 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.1(d)(ii)_;

 



 

then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of
$25,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in
no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be made
by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by
Parent (x) at the earlier of execution of a definitive agreement with respect
to, submission to the shareholders of the Company of, or the consummation of
any transaction contemplated by a Company Acquisition Proposal, in the case of
a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, (y) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days thereof), in the case of a Company Termination
Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(ii)_, and (z) at the time of
termination, in the case of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to
_Section 9.3(b)(iii)_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, except in the case of fraud or intentional and willful misconduct as
expressly provided below, in the event that the Company Termination Fee
becomes payable, then payment to Parent of the Company Termination Fee,
together with any amounts due under _Section 9.3(f)_, shall be Parents sole
and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages
of any nature against the Company, Company LP, the Company Subsidiaries and
each of their respective former, current and future trustees, directors,
officers, employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
shareholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future
trustee, director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") in respect of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the termination of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the failure of the Mergers to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder (whether intentionally, unintentionally, or
otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment of such Company Termination Fee no
Company Party shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that neither the Company nor Company LP
shall be relieved from any liability or damages resulting from any fraud in
connection with this Agreement or any willful and intentional breach (as
defined in _Section 9.2_ above) of any of its covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement prior to such termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated by either Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section
9.1(c)(i)_ under circumstances in which the Company Termination Fee is not
payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, then the Company shall pay, within
three (3) Business Days of the Outside Date, to Parent the Parent Expenses in
immediately available funds to an account directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
that the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this
_Section 9.3(c)_ shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation
to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ (but in the
event such Company Termination Fee is or becomes payable, it shall be reduced
on a dollar for dollar basis for the Parent Expenses actually paid to Parent
pursuant to this _Section 9.3(c)_) and neither the Company nor Company LP
shall be relieved from any liability or damages resulting from any fraud in
connection with this Agreement or any willful and intentional breach of any of
its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) If the Company is required to pay Parent the Company Termination Fee (a "
_Termination Payment_ "), such Termination Payment shall be paid into escrow
on the date such payment is required to be paid by such party (" _Payor_ ")
pursuant to this Agreement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an escrow account designated in accordance with this _Section 9.3(d)_. In the
event that a Payor is required to pay a Termination Fee, the amount payable to
the other party (such party, " _Payee_ ") in any tax year of Payee shall not
exceed the lesser of (i) the Termination Payment, and (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Payee without causing such party to fail to
meet the requirements of Section 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the
relevant tax year, determined as if the payment of such amount did not
constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code ("
_Qualifying Income_ "), and Payee has income from unknown sources during such
year in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying
Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in each case as determined by Payees independent accountants, plus
(B) in the event Payee receives either (x) a letter from Payees counsel
indicating that Payee has received a ruling from the IRS as described in
_Section 9.3(e)_ or (y) an opinion from its outside counsel as described in
_Section 9.3(e)_, an amount equal to the excess of the Termination Payment
less the amount payable under _clause (A)_ above.

 



 

(e) To secure the Companys obligation to pay any amounts payable pursuant to
_Section 9.3(c)_, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to the Termination Payment owed by it with an escrow agent selected by
the Company on such terms (subject to this _Section 9.3_) as shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Company, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment
or deposit into escrow of the Termination Payment pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.3(e)_ shall be made at the time the Company is obligated to pay
Parent such amount pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. The escrow agreement shall provide that the
Termination Payment held in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be
released to Parent unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of
the following: (i) a letter from Parents independent accountants indicating
the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Parent without
causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
Qualifying Income and Parent has income from unknown sources during such year
in an amount equal to 1% of its gross income which is not Qualifying Income
(in addition to any known or anticipated income which is not Qualifying
Income), in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to the
receiving party, or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that (A)
Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by such Parent
of the Termination Payment would either constitute Qualifying Income or would
be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3)
of the Code or (B) Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to
the effect that the receipt by Parent of the Termination Payment should either
constitute Qualifying Income should be excluded from gross income within the
meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, in which case the escrow
agent shall release the remainder of the Termination Payment to Parent. The
Company agrees to amend this _Section 9.3_ at the reasonable request of
Parent in order to (i) maximize the portion of the Termination Payment that
may be distributed to Parent hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (ii) improve
Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this _Section
9.3_ or (iii) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its
outside counsel as described in this _Section 9.3_. Any amount of the
Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section 9.3_, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the obligation of the Company to pay the unpaid portion of the Termination
Payment shall terminate on the December 31 following the date which is five
(5) years from the date of this Agreement. Any payment due to Parent described
in this _Section 9.3_ shall be subject to the same limitations on payment as
set forth in this _Section 9.3_.

 



 

(f) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other Party would
not enter into this Agreement. If the Company fails promptly to pay any
amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_, the Company shall pay
to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the
amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_ from the date of termination of this
Agreement at the prime rate set forth in the _Wall Street Journal_ in effect
on the date such payment was required to be made plus 1%.

 _Section 10.3_ _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present
or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction,
(a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement
shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other
provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party, and (d) such terms or other
provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 _Section 10.4_ _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
Parties and delivered (by electronic delivery or otherwise) to the other
Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by facsimile transmission,
by electronic mail in .pdf format, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

 



 

 _Section 10.5_ _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement (including any Exhibit, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) and the Nondisclosure Agreement constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except for the provisions of _Article 3_
(which, from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time and REIT Merger
Effective Time, as applicable, shall be for the benefit of holders of the
Company Partnership Units immediately prior to the Partnership Merger
Effective Time or the holders of the Company Common Shares immediately prior
to the REIT Merger Effective Time, as applicable), and _Section 7.5_ (which,
from and after the Partnership Merger Effective Time and the REIT Merger
Effective Time shall be for the benefit of the Indemnified Parties); provided,
however, that any Financing Sources and any of their respective
Representatives shall be intended third party beneficiaries with respect to
_Sections 10.9(b)_ , _10.12(b)_ and _10.13_ (and no amendment or modification
to such provisions in respect of any Financing Sources may be made

 



      
 

 



 

without the prior consent of such Financing Sources). The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties other than as described in this
_Section 10.5_. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the Parties in accordance with _Section 10.8_ without
notice or liability to any other Person. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
Parties. Accordingly, Persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

 _Section 10.6_ _Tender Offer_. The Company and Company LP agree, upon
written request by Parent, to cooperate and work in good faith with Parent to
effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by means of a
tender offer for all of the outstanding Company Common Shares for the REIT Per
Share Merger Consideration and to make such reasonable and customary
amendments to this Agreement as the Parties mutually agree are necessary to
reflect such structure; provided that (i) such tender offer structure shall
not delay the Closing and (ii) the inability to make or complete such a tender
offer shall not relieve the obligations of Parent, REIT Merger Sub or
Partnership Merger Sub to consummate the Mergers as required under this
Agreement. The Parties agree that the obligation of the Company and Company LP
to cooperate and work in good faith with Parent pursuant to this _Section
10.6_ shall not require the Company Board to approve any action that it
believes is inconsistent with its duties under applicable Law.

 



 

 _Section 10.7_ _Amendment_. Subject to any consent rights of Financing
Sources pursuant to _Section 10.5_ and compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by the Company Board and the Parent Board, respectively,
at any time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval and
prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that after the Company Shareholder Approval
has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment of this Agreement that
changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this
Agreement to the holders of the Company Common Shares or the Company
Partnership Units, or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of
the shareholders of the Company without such further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the Parties.

 



 

 _Section 10.8_ _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Partnership
Merger Effective Time and the REIT Merger Effective Time, a Party may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) subject to the
requirements of applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

 



 

 _Section 10.9_ _Governing Law_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and all Actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort)
that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties hereto and
any Company Affiliates acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i) that any Action
involving a Financing Source that is in any way related to this Agreement, the
Mergers or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
performance of services hereunder or related hereto, including, without
limitation, any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the

State of New York that would result in the application of the laws of any
other State, (ii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses provided in
_Section 10.2_ shall be effective service of process against them for any
such Action, and (iii) that a final judgment in any such Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the Parties hereby agrees that it will not, nor permit any
of its respective Affiliates to, bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third party claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Mergers or any
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, located in the Borough of Manhattan, or, if
under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts,
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
the appellate courts thereof), and that the provisions of _Section 10.13_
relating to the waiver of jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim.

 



 

 _Section 10.10_ _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably agrees and
consents (a) to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal
court located in the State of Maryland or any Maryland State court (the "
_Maryland Courts_ ") for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract,
tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of
the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of
this Agreement, and further that any proceeding in Maryland State court shall
be assigned to the Business and Technology Case Management Program, (b) that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court, (c) that it will not bring any Action
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement in any court other than the
Maryland Courts, and (d) that a final judgment in any Action shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law.

 



 

 _Section 10.11_ _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties
without the prior written consent of the other Parties and any attempt to make
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void.

 



      
 

 



 

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns.

 



 

 _Section 10.12_ _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached (including the obligation of Parent,
REIT Merger Sub or the Partnership Merger Sub to consummate, as applicable,
the REIT Merger and the Partnership Merger in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), and that monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_, each Party
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or
other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of
damages or otherwise (including the Parties obligations to consummate the
Mergers and the obligation of the Parent, REIT Merger Sub or Partnership
Merger Sub to pay, and the right of the holders of Company Common Stock and
the holders of Company Partnership Units to receive, the REIT Merger
Consideration, aggregate Share Award Payments and Partnership Merger
Consideration, as applicable, pursuant to the Mergers, subject in each case to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy
to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties
hereby waives (i) any defense in an Action for specific performance that a
remedy at Law would be adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post
a security as prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party agrees
that the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right neither the Company nor Company LP, on the one hand, nor Parent,
REIT Merger Sub or Partnership Merger Sub, on the other hand, would have
entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may
pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies to the
extent permitted by this _Section 10.11_ and the payment of damages, but
shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific
performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and consummation of the
Mergers occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of
specific performance or other equitable remedies if damages are awarded.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Company (on
behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, trustees, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any rights or claims
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any Financing
or definitive Financing agreements or in respect of any other document or
theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in respect
of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, and the Company (on behalf of itself and any
of its Affiliates, trustees, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) agrees not to commence any action or proceeding against any
Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, any Financing or
definitive Financing agreements or in respect of any related document or
theory of law or equity and agrees to cause any such action or proceeding
asserted by the Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates,
trustees, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) in
connection with this Agreement, any Financing or definitive Financing
agreements or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity
against any Financing Source to be dismissed or otherwise

 



      
 

 



 

terminated, provided that any Financing Sources and any of their respective
Representatives shall be intended third parties beneficiaries with respect to
_Sections 10.9(b)_ , _10.12(b)_ and _10.13_. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no
Financing Source shall have any liability for any claims or damages to the
Company in connection with this Agreement, any Financing or definitive
Financing agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 



 

 _Section 10.13_ _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY HEREBY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY
HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT,
THE MERGERS OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY TRANSACTION OR PROPOSED TRANSACTION WITH ANY FINANCING
SOURCE). EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER
AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.13_.

 



 

 _Section 10.14_ _Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language
of this Agreement are the result of negotiations between the Parties and their
respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any
ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any
