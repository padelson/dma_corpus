Section 2.5, and as of the Effective Time, each outstanding share of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,

Share shall be treated as described in Section 2.4 (h); or    (iii) each
share of Company Common Stock held by the Parent or Merger Sub shall be

subject to equitable adjustment in the event of any stock split, stock
dividend, reverse stock split, or other change in the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding to which Parent consents pursuant to Section
5.1. No share of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding or to
have any rights other than those set forth above in this Section 2.4(e) after
the Effective Time.   (f) Options; Stock Purchase Plan.   (i) Immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding and vested portion of a Company
Stock Option shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and in consideration for such cancellation, the holder thereof shall
become entitled to receive from the Company an amount of cash equal to the
product of (A) the number of vested shares subject to the Company Stock
Option and (B) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per share
exercise price of the Company Stock Option, less the amount of applicable
foreign, federal, state and local taxes required to be withheld from such
payment. The Company shall pay the amounts payable to each holder of a vested
Company Stock Option as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time. The Company shall pay promptly any amounts withheld for
applicable foreign, federal, state and local taxes to the appropriate
Governmental Authority on behalf of such holder of such Company Stock
Option.   (ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, a number of
unvested Company Stock Options held by each holder thereof equal to the
lesser of (i) unvested Company Stock Options to purchase 1,000 shares
of Company Common Stock or (ii) the number of unvested Company Stock Options
held by such holder, shall accelerate, fully vest and be treated immediately
prior to the Effective Time as vested Company Stock Options under Section
2.4(f)(i); provided that such Company Stock Options to be vested shall be the
unvested Company Stock Options which would have    9    otherwise
vested at the earliest dates following the Effective Time. Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, except as provided in the preceding sentence,
each outstanding and unvested portion of a Company Stock Option shall be
cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time, and in consideration for
such cancellation, the holder thereof shall become entitled to receive at the
time such unvested portion of a Company Stock Option would have vested, if
such unvested portion had not been cancelled in accordance with this Section
2.4 (f)(ii), an amount of cash equal to the product of (A) the number of
unvested shares subject to the Company Stock Option that would have vested on
such date and (B) the excess of the Merger Consideration (without interest)
over the per share exercise price of the Company Stock Option, less the
amount of applicable foreign, federal, state and local taxes required to be
withheld from such payment, provided that the right of the holder of the
Company Stock Option to receive this sum is not conditioned on the
Employee\'s continued employment or provision of services after the Effective
Time. The Company shall pay the amounts payable to each holder of an unvested
Company Stock Option as soon as reasonably practicable following the date or
dates the unvested portions of the Company Stock option would have otherwise
vested if such unvested portions had not been cancelled in accordance with
this Section 2.4(f)(ii). The Company shall pay promptly any amounts withheld
or due for applicable foreign, federal, state and local taxes to the
appropriate Governmental Authority on behalf of the holder of such Company
Stock Option.  (iii) Each purchase right (a "Purchase Right") under the
Company ESPP outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
accelerate, fully vest and automatically be exercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time in  accordance with the provisions of the Company
ESPP. Shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon such acceleration,
vesting and exercise of each Purchase Right shall be issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and shall therefore be subject to the
terms of this Agreement. The Company shall use its best efforts to provide
written notice of the Merger to holders of a Purchase Right at least ten (10)
days prior to the Effective Time.   (iv) Prior to the Effective Time the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents from all
holders of Company Stock Options and to make any amendments to the terms of
such stock options or compensations plans or arrangements that are necessary
to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.4(f). At
the Effective Time the Company shall terminate the Company Stock Option Plan
and the Company ESPP.   (v) No interest shall be paid on any amounts to
be paid pursuant to this Section 2.4(f).    (vi) The Company will use
reasonable best efforts so that, immediately following the Effective Time,
none of Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation is or will be
bound by the Company Stock Option Plan, the Company ESPP, Purchase Right, any
Company Stock Option or any other options, warrants, rights or agreements
which would entitle any Person, other than Parent or its Affiliates, to own
any capital stock of the Company, Merger Sub or the Surviving   
10    Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof, except as
otherwise provided herein.   (g) Company Debentures.   (i) Prior to the
Effective Time the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
consents from the holders of the Company Debentures or otherwise to amend
each Company Debenture to provide for the automatic conversion immediately
prior to the Merger of such Company Debenture into Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of the Company Debentures as of the date hereof.
Shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time for purposes of this
Agreement.   (ii) Any Company Debenture outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and which is not subject to automatic conversion pursuant
to Section 2.4(g)(i) or otherwise as of the Merger shall be deemed assumed by
the Surviving Corporation and to constitute an obligation of the Surviving
Corporation; provided that, on the terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Company Debenture prior to the Effective Time, each Company
Debenture shall cease to be convertible into shares of Company Common Stock
or shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation, but shall
be convertible into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the
product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock into which such
Company Debenture would have been convertible in accordance with its terms,
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration payable per share of Company
Common Stock.   (h) Dissenting Shares.   (i) Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock held by
a holder who has demanded and perfected dissenters\' rights for such shares
in accordance with the California Code and who, as of the Effective Time, has
not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters\' rights ("Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(e), but the holder thereof shall
only be entitled to such rights as are granted by the California Code.  
(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) above, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands purchase of such shares under the
California Code shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holder\'s dissenters\' rights, then, as of the
later of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the occurrence of such event, such
holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.4(e),
without interest thereon, upon surrender to the Company of the Certificate
representing such shares in accordance with this Agreement.   (iii) The
Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of its receipt of any written
demands for dissenters\' rights and any withdrawals of such   
11    demands and (B) the opportunity to participate in and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters\' rights
under the California Code. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent or as may be required under Applicable Law,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for purchase of
Company Common Stock pursuant to dissenters\' rights or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.   (i) Conversion of Capital Stock of the Merger
Sub. At and as of the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock, $.00001 par
value per share, of Merger Sub shall be converted into one share of Common
Stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.5
Procedure for Payment.   (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall designate a bank or trust company to act as paying agent (the
"Paying Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger
Consideration. Parent or Merger Sub shall, from time to time, make available
or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent funds (the "Payment Fund")
in such amounts and at times necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in the manner provided herein. The Paying Agent shall invest
portions of the Merger Consideration as Parent directs (it being understood
that any and all interest earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to this Agreement shall be the property of, and shall be turned over
to, Parent), provided, that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or of any agency thereof and
backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in
commercial paper obligations rated A1 or P1 or better by Moody\'s Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard and Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in deposit
accounts, certificates of deposit or banker\'s acceptances of, repurchase or
reverse repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased
from, commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating in excess of US$100 million (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available).   (b) Letter of
Transmittal. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or
more shares of Company Common Stock, (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and which shall have such other provisions as Parent shall
reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.   (c)
Entitlement of Shares. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, after giving effect to
any withholding tax required by Applicable Law, and the Certificates so   
12    surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.5, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger
Consideration.   (d) Payments to Other Persons. If Merger Consideration is
to be paid to any Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates
for shares surrendered for conversion are registered, it shall be a condition
of the payment that such Certificates be properly endorsed and the signatures
thereon properly guaranteed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such payment shall have paid to the Paying Agent
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the delivery of Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate, or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (e)
Termination. Any portion of the Payment Fund held by the Paying Agent for
delivery pursuant to this Section 2.5 and unclaimed at the end of six months
after the Effective Time shall be paid or delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Section 2.5 shall, subject to Applicable
Law, thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger Consideration in respect of shares of Company Common Stock and shall
have no rights against Parent with respect to such payments. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amount paid to any Governmental Authority pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts unclaimed by holders
of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority) shall, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.   (f) Stock Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights.
At and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed, and there shall be no further registrations of transfers of
shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From
and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing
ownership of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except as otherwise provided
for herein or by Applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Section 2.5, subject to Section 2.5(e).  
(g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. Notwithstanding anything here to
the contrary herein, in the event any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or    13    destroyed, Parent shall pay the Merger Consideration
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; provided, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to provide
an indemnity or deliver a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.   Section
2.6 Subsequent Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either Merger Sub or the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Merger, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are hereby authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of each of Merger Sub or the
Company or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and

Sub or the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the
Merger.   ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company or any agreement to which the
Company is a party or by which the Company is bound.   (c) The Company does

thereunder, as the case may be, applicable to such Company SEC reports, and
none of the Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (as amended
through the date hereof), contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.   (b) Each of the balance sheets (including the
related notes) included in the Company SEC Reports fairly presents the
financial position of the Company as of the date thereof, and the other
related financial statements (including the related notes) included therein

this Agreement, and such Tax Returns are true, complete and correct in all
material respects. The Company has paid or made adequate provision in

collections either have been duly and timely paid over to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities or are, together with the payments due or to become
due in connection therewith, duly reflected on the financial statements of
the Company. There are no audits, examinations, administrative proceedings or
court proceedings, pending or proposed with regard to any Taxes or Tax
Returns filed by the Company. The Company has not given or been requested to

the filing of Tax Returns or the assessment of Taxes for which the Company
may have any undisclosed liability, except for any waiver or extension which

the Company no claim has ever been made by any Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where the Company does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to taxation by that jurisdiction. The Tax Returns of the Company have
not been audited by the IRS (or the appropriate statute of limitations has
expired) for any fiscal years through the fiscal year ending June 30,

with its terms.   (iv) Each Company Employee Plan intended to qualify under

qualify pursuant to a favorable determination letter after January 1, 1989,
and each trust maintained pursuant thereto has been determined by the IRS to
be exempt from taxation under Section 501 of the Code. Nothing has occurred
to the Knowledge of the Company which may reasonably be expected to impair
such determination of any Company Employee Plan and its related trust.

Code. No fact or event exists which could give rise to any liability under
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.   (vi) With respect to each

exhausted) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or
imminent against or with respect to any Company Employee Plan, any employer
who is    19    participating (or who has participated) in any Company
Employee Plan or any fiduciary (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA), of the
Company Employee Plan.   (vii) All of the Company Employee Plans, to
the extent applicable, are in compliance in all material respects with
the continuation of group health coverage provisions continued in Section

(2) to a fine under Section 502 of ERISA.   (xiv) There are no

entering into a confidentiality agreement with, or entering into discussions
or negotiations with, any Person in connection with an unsolicited bona fide
proposal by such Person relating to an Alternative Transaction if, and only
to the extent that (A) the board of directors of the Company, after
consultation with the Company\'s financial advisors, believes in good faith
that such proposal could lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect
that it is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, (iii) complying with Rule 14e2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or making such disclosure to the Company\'s
shareholders as, in the good faith determination of the Company\'s board of
directors, is required by Applicable Law, (iv) recommending a
Superior Proposal, provided, that the terms of Section 5.4(e) are met, or (v)
entering into an agreement or understanding with respect to a Superior
Proposal, provided, that the terms of Section 5.4(f) are met.   (e) The
Company agrees that neither the board of directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof will (i) withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the
board of directors of the Company with respect to the Merger or (ii) approve
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Alternative
Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if, prior to the Effective Time, (x) in response
to a bona fide unsolicited proposal with respect to an Alternative
Transaction (including following any actions permitted by paragraph (d)), the
board of directors of the Company determines, in its good faith judgment
taking into account the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel,
that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, or (y) under circumstances not
related to an Alternative Transaction, the Company\'s board of
directors, after consultation with outside counsel, determines in good faith
that failure to take such action would breach its fiduciary duties to the
Company\'s shareholders under Applicable Law, the board of directors of the
Company may (subject to this and the following sentences) take any or all of
the actions described in the preceding sentence; provided, that the Company
shall immediately inform Parent orally and in writing of the material terms
and conditions of such Alternative Transaction and the identity of the Person
making it, or such other circumstances, and if any Alternative Transaction is
in writing, the Company shall immediately deliver a copy thereof to Parent,
if the Company has not already done so pursuant to Section 5.4(b). Nothing in
this Section 5.4(e) shall in any way limit or otherwise affect Parent\'s
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1. Any withdrawal or
modification of the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company
shall not change the approval of the board of directors of the Company for
purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be
inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Merger.   (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
if, prior to the Effective Time, in response to a bona fide unsolicited
proposal with respect to an Alternative Transaction (including following any
actions permitted by paragraph (d)), if the board of directors of the
Company determines, in its good faith judgment taking into   
33    account the advice of its financial advisor and outside counsel,
that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, the board of directors of the
Company may (subject to this and the following sentence) terminate this
Agreement; provided, that the Company gives Parent at least two Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement, during
which two Business Day or longer period, the Company if requested by Parent
engages in good faith negotiations with Parent with respect to such changes
as Parent may propose to the terms of this Agreement. Nothing in this Section
5.4(f) shall in any way limit or otherwise affect Parent\'s right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1.   Section 5.5 Conduct of
Business by Parent and Merger Sub Pending the Merger. During the period from
the date of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub
shall not engage in any action or enter into any transaction or permit any
action to be taken or transaction to be entered into that could reasonably be
expected to delay the consummation of, or otherwise adversely affect, any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   ARTICLE VI  ADDITIONAL

shareholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger.  
Section 6.2 Proxy Statement.   (a) The Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC a preliminary Proxy Statement relating to the Merger and this
Agreement, and use its reasonable best efforts (x) to obtain and furnish the

the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.   (c) The

of such Board that shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval
of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement.   (d) Parent shall furnish
to the Company such information concerning itself and Merger Sub, for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement, as may be requested by the Company and
required to be included in the Proxy Statement. Such information provided by

modifications made by Parent or Merger Sub to such information) at the time
of the Shareholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order that the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, are not misleading.   (e) Parent shall vote or
cause to be voted all shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by
Parent or Merger Sub, or which Parent or Merger Sub have the power to vote or
direct the vote of in favor of, adoption of the Merger and the Merger.

Subject to Section 6.3(b), Parent shall keep such information confidential in
accordance with the terms of the letter agreement, dated February 16, 2001
(the "Confidentiality Agreement") between Parent and the Company. Neither
Parent nor the Company shall disclose to any sales representatives,
distributors, brokers, customers, suppliers or Employees of the Company any
information concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
without the prior written consent of the other party.   (b) The Company
agrees that Parent may use, and the Company shall deliver, such consents of
the Company and shall request the Company\'s outside public accountants to
deliver such consents as may be reasonably requested by Parent to the use of

their reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain (and shall each refrain from
taking any willful action that would impede obtaining) all consents, waivers,

rulings, decisions or approvals by any Governmental Authority), and the
Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to promptly
make all filings (including, without limitation, the premerger notification
filings required under the HSR Act, and all other filings with Governmental
Authorities), required in connection with the authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by the Company and Parent and the consummation by
them of the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Each party hereby agrees
to use its reasonable best efforts to file the premerger notification report,
and all other documents to be filed in connection therewith, required by the
HSR Act and the Premerger Notification Rules promulgated thereunder with the
United States Federal Trade Commission and the United States Department of
Justice as soon as practicable following the date hereof, but in any event
within five days following the date hereof. Each party shall respond promptly
to any request for additional information that may be issued by either
Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice and shall use reasonable
best efforts to assure that the waiting period required by the HSR Act has
expired or been terminated prior to the date that is 30 days after such

party shall coordinate with one another in preparing and exchanging such
information, and shall promptly provide the other (or its counsel) with
copies of all filings, presentations or submissions made by such party with
any Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and Company shall promptly
make all necessary filings with Governmental Authorities and shall promptly
provide the other party with copies of filings made by such party between the
date hereof and the Effective Time.   Section 6.5 Notification of Certain
Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of
any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to be materially
untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, to materially comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice and further provided that failure to give
such notice shall not be treated as a breach of a covenant hereunder unless
the failure to give such notice results in material prejudice to the other
party.   Section 6.6 Further Assurances. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto in doing, as
promptly as practicable, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to obtain in a timely manner all necessary
waivers, consents and approvals and to effect all necessary registrations and
filings, and to otherwise satisfy or cause to be satisfied all conditions
precedent to its obligations under this Agreement.   Section 6.7 Public
Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; provided, however, that a party may, without the prior
consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public
statement as may upon the advice of counsel be required by law or the NASD or
the NYSE if it has used reasonable best efforts to consult with the other
party.   Section 6.8 Conveyance Taxes. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns,

Liability.   (a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold
harmless (and make advances as incurred to) the present and former officers

prior to the Effective Time to the extent provided under the Company\'s
Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date hereof.   (b)
Parent will and will cause the Surviving Corporation to perform any
indemnification agreements between the Company and any of its directors,
officers and Employees in force as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect the policies of directors\' and
officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company for the benefit of
those Persons who are covered by such policies at the date hereof or the
Effective Time (or Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time); provided, that the Parent and/or the
Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium in
excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof which is set forth in Section 3.23 of the
Company\'s Disclosure Letter and if the Surviving Corporation is unable to
obtain the insurance required by this Section 6.9(c) it shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum

indemnification under this Section 6.9.   Section 6.10 Action by Parent and
Company\'s Boards. Prior to the Effective Time, the boards of directors of
Parent and the Company shall each comply as applicable with the provisions of
the SEC\'s noaction letter dated January 12, 1999 addressed to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP relating to Section 16(b) of the Exchange
Act.   Section 6.11 Employee Benefits.    (a) Parent agrees that all
Employees of the Company other than the Company\'s current directors who

provided such employment on terms and conditions that, in the aggregate,
substantially as favorable as provided by the Company as of the

that the Company has not otherwise breached Section 5.2 hereof with respect
to increases in wages and salaries.   (b) As of the Effective Time through
the period ending February 28, 2002, Parent shall, or shall cause the

other stockbased compensation), except as required by Applicable Law. From
and after March 1, 2002, and until February 28, 2004, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, treat Continuing Employees no less
favorably than employees of Parent, in the aggregate, who are in comparable
positions and at comparable locations and shall give each Continuing Employee
past service credit under its compensation and benefit plans and arrangements
and for all employee benefits purposes for service with the Company prior to
the Effective Time as if such service had been with Parent; provided, that
such credit for past service with the Company shall be solely for purposes of
vesting and eligibility, but not benefit accrual. Parent shall honor, or
cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with their terms and
bear any cost associated with all employee benefit obligations to current and

Corporation to provide, to Continuing Employees the currently provided
coverage under the Company\'s existing medical, dental and health plans or

Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for providing all legallymandated
continuation coverage for Continuing Employees and their covered dependents
who experience a loss of coverage due to a "qualifying event" (within the
meaning of Section 603 of ERISA) which occurs at any time on or after the
Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.11 is intended to create any
employment obligation other than as employees at will who may be terminated
with or without cause.   Section 6.12 Payment of Accrued Bonuses. As of the
Effective Time, the annual bonus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2001,
