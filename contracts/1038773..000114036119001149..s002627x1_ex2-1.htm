into which the same shall have been converted) is not claimed prior to the
date on which such Merger Consideration or other amounts would otherwise
escheat to any Governmental Entity, such Merger Consideration or other 
amounts shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned property, escheat, and
other applicable Laws, become the property of SmartFinancial (and to the
extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all
claims or interests  of any Person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any Party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration (or any other
property) properly paid or delivered  to a Governmental Entity pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat, or similar Laws. SmartFinancial and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books and
records of the Company to establish the identity of  those Persons entitled
to receive the Merger Consideration (and any other amounts) specified in this
Agreement, which books and records shall be conclusive with respect thereto.
In the event of a dispute regarding the ownership of Company Common  Stock,
SmartFinancial and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any Merger
Consideration (or any other amounts) issuable or payable in respect thereof in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect
to  any claims or Liability with respect thereto.

 


 

 

 

 

Section 3.3 _Rights as Company Shareholders_. Holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at and after the Effective
Time, cease to be shareholders of the Company and have no further rights as 
shareholders of the Company, other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts issuable or payable in respect of such
holders' Company Common Stock (or the shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock
into which the same  shall have been converted) in accordance with this
_Article III_.

 


 

 

 

Section 3.4 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, no fraction of a share of SmartFinancial
Common Stock, and no certificate or scrip therefor, will be issued in
connection with  the Merger to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock.
Instead, SmartFinancial shall pay to each holder of Company Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of SmartFinancial Common
Stock (after aggregating and  taking into account all Certificates and/or
Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) cash, without interest, in an
amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (a) the
fractional share interest (rounded to the nearest  thousandth when expressed
in decimal form) to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by (b) the
volume weighted average closing price per share of SmartFinancial Common Stock
on Nasdaq (or such other securities market or stock exchange on  which the
SmartFinancial Common Stock then principally trades) for the 20 consecutive
trading days ending on and including the Business Day that is two Business
Days immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 


 

 

 

Section 3.5 _Excluded Shares_. At the Effective Time, each Excluded Share

13  


 

 

 

Section 3.7 _SmartFinancial Stock_. The shares of SmartFinancial Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not be affected
by the Merger, and, accordingly, each share of SmartFinancial Stock issued
and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, at and after
the Effective Time, remain issued and outstanding.

 


 

 

Section 3.8 _Adjustments Upon Change in Capitalization_. If during the period
from the date of this Agreement until immediately prior to the Effective Time
the outstanding shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock or Company Common
Stock  are increased, decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of securities as a result of a reorganization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, an  equitable and proportionate adjustment
shall be made to the Exchange Ratio and, therefore, the Merger Consideration
issuable or payable pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
neither the grant of, the issuance of shares of  SmartFinancial Common Stock
upon the exercise or settlement of, or the lapse of restrictions with respect
to SmartFinancial Equity Awards nor the issuance of shares of Company Common
Stock upon the exercise or settlement of, or the lapse of  restrictions with
respect to, Company Equity Awards shall cause or result in an adjustment of or
to the Exchange Ratio or the Merger Consideration. This _Section 3.8_   shall
not be interpreted to authorize any action prohibited by any other provision
of this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 3.9 _Company Equity Awards_.

 


 

 

 

 

(a) At the Effective Time, solely by virtue and as a result of the  Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be assumed by SmartFinancial. Each Company Option so assumed shall
at and  after the Effective Time be and represent an option to purchase that
number of shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock equal to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the  Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio
(rounded to the nearest whole number), and the per share exercise price of the
resulting option to purchase  shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock shall be
equal to the per share exercise price of the Company Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time divided by  the Exchange Ratio (carried to two decimal
places with the second decimal place rounded to the nearest whole number).
With respect to any Company Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock
option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code),  the adjustments described
above will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the
Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and with respect to each
other Company Option, such adjustments shall be made in compliance  with
Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder so as not
to constitute a modification of such Company Option. Prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and SmartFinancial shall use commercially reasonable
efforts  to take all action necessary to provide for the assumption of any
such Company Options by SmartFinancial in the manner contemplated by this
_Section 3.9(a)_.

 


 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, solely by virtue and as a result of the  Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each Company RSU
Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully
vest and shall be canceled and converted automatically into the right to
receive the  Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1_ (payable in
accordance with this _Article III_   and subject to any required Tax
withholding), treating the shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company RSU Award in the same manner as all other shares of Company Common
Stock for such purposes.

 


 

 

 

 

Section 3.10 _Withholding Rights_. SmartFinancial and the Exchange Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration issuable, payable,
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former 
holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts
as are required under or by the Code or any other applicable Law to be
deducted or withheld. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be timely
remitted to the  appropriate Governmental Entity and, to the extent so
remitted, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

material respects, and all Taxes due and payable by the Entegra Parties and
their Subsidiaries with respect to the periods covered by such Entegra Returns
have been paid (whether or not  shown on any Entegra Returns). The accruals
and reserves for Taxes reflected in the Company Balance Sheet are adequate, in
accordance with GAAP, to cover all unpaid Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for periods ending on or prior to the  date of the Company
Balance Sheet, and all such accruals and reserves for Taxes, as adjusted for
operations and transactions and the passage of time for periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date in accordance with past custom and practice  of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, will be adequate, in accordance with GAAP, to
cover all unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries accruing through
the Closing Date. No written claim has ever been made against the Entegra
Parties or  any of their Subsidiaries by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction
where the Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns
that the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries are or may be

third party (including any Taxes  due under Section 409A of the Code) have
been duly withheld or collected and have been paid, to the extent required, to
the proper taxing authorities. The Entegra Parties and their Subsidiaries have
complied with all information reporting and  backup withholding requirements,
including the maintenance of required records, with respect to such amounts.

and other applicable Laws.

Subsidiaries, to bargain with any labor union or labor organization as to
wages and conditions of employment, nor, to the Knowledge  of the Company,
has any such proceeding been threatened, nor is there any strike, labor

Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(iii) To the Knowledge of the Company, no director, officer, employee, or
independent contractor of or to the Company or the Bank or any of their
Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by any Contract, including
without limitation any  confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation,
or proprietary rights agreement, that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the ability of the Company or the Bank or any of their
Subsidiaries to conduct its business as currently  conducted or the ability
of such Person to perform and carry out such Person's duties or
responsibilities.

 


 

 

(iv) Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has any
material Liability for (A) classifying any Person as an "independent
contractor" or any similar status who, under applicable Law or the provisions
of any Entegra  Benefit Plan (as defined below), should have been classified

(s) Benefit Plans.

a true, correct, and complete list of all pension, retirement, survivor
income, salary continuation, stock option, restricted stock,  restricted
stock unit, stock purchase, stock ownership, savings, stock appreciation
right, capital appreciation, profit sharing, deferred compensation,
consulting, bonus, group insurance, disability, severance, change of control,

benefit plans, contracts, agreements, and arrangements, including without
limitation "employee benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
incentive and welfare policies,  contracts, plans, and arrangements,
including split dollar life insurance arrangements, and all trust agreements
and funding arrangements related thereto, which are or have been maintained,
sponsored, or contributed to (or required to be  contributed to) by the
Company or the Bank or an ERISA Affiliate for the benefit of or with respect
to any present or former directors, officers, employees, independent
contractors, or consultants of the Company or the Bank or any of their 
respective Subsidiaries, or any spouse or dependent of any such Person, or to
or under which the Company or the Bank or an ERISA Affiliate has or may have
any Liability, contingent or otherwise (herein referred to collectively as the
"Entegra Benefit Plans"), including any and all plans or policies offered to
employees of the Company or the Bank, or any of their respective 
Subsidiaries, with respect to which the Company or the Bank or an ERISA
Affiliate has claimed or is claiming the safe harbor for "voluntary plans"
under ERISA for group and group-type insurance arrangements ("Entegra
Voluntary Plans"). The Entegra Parties have previously delivered or made
available to SmartFinancial true, correct, and complete copies of all plans, 
contracts, agreements, arrangements, and other documents required to be set
forth on _Schedule 4.2(s)(i)_ of the Entegra Disclosure Memorandum, along 
with, where applicable, copies of the IRS Form 5500 for the most recently
completed year. There has been no announcement or commitment by the Company or
the Bank, or any of their Subsidiaries, to create any additional Entegra
Benefit Plan, to  amend any Entegra Benefit Plan (except for amendments
required by applicable Law which do not materially increase the cost of such
Entegra Benefit Plan), or to terminate any Entegra Benefit Plan.

 


 

 

(ii) Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no pending  or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened or suspected claim, litigation, action,
administrative action, suit, audit, arbitration, mediation, or other
proceeding relating to any Entegra Benefit Plan. All of the Entegra Benefit
Plans comply  in all material respects with applicable requirements of ERISA
and the Code and other applicable Laws (including without limitation the
portability, privacy, and security provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of  1996, as amended; the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009, as amended; the coverage
continuation requirements of Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended; the Family and Medical Leave Act,  as
amended; the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, as amended; the Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, as amended; the Uniformed Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, as amended; the Newborns' and Mothers'
Health  Protection Act of 1996, as amended; the Women's Health and Cancer
Rights Act, as amended; and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of
2008, as amended), and have been established, maintained, and administered in
compliance, in all  material respects, with all applicable requirements of
ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws and the terms and provisions of
all documents, contracts, or agreements establishing the Entegra Benefit Plans
or pursuant to which they are  maintained or administered. To the Knowledge
of the Company, there are no existing circumstances and no event has occurred
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of
any Entegra Benefit Plan intended to be  tax-qualified under Section 401 of
the Code. No audit of any Entegra Benefit Plan by the IRS, the United States
Department of Labor, or any other Governmental Entity is ongoing or to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened, or was ongoing or  closed or to the
Knowledge of the Company threatened at any time during the past five years.
There has occurred no "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Entegra Benefit Plan 
that is likely to result in, or has already resulted in, the imposition of any
penalties or Taxes upon the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries
under Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

 


 

 

(iii) No Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has  been, or
is expected by the Entegra Parties or their Subsidiaries to be, incurred with
respect to any Entegra Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (an
"Entegra Pension Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan" (as
defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by the
Company or the Bank or any ERISA Affiliate. No Entegra Pension  Plan had an
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA), whether
or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the most recent plan year
ending prior to the date hereof, and no notice of a "reportable event" (as 
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the reporting requirement has not
been waived has been required to be filed for any Entegra Pension Plan within
the 12-month period ending on the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company
nor the  Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has provided or is required to
provide security to any Entegra Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of
an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code. Neither the
Company nor the Bank,  nor any of their Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate,
has contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan"
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 


 

 

 

 

26  


 

 

 

(iv) Each Entegra Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension  benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code (an "Entegra  Qualified Plan") has received
a current favorable determination letter from the IRS (or, in the case of an
IRS pre-approved plan, the pre-approved plan has a current IRS opinion or
advisory letter upon which the Entegra Parties are  entitled to rely under
applicable IRS guidance), and to the Knowledge of the Company there are no
facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation of any such favorable determination letter. Each Entegra 
Qualified Plan, if any, that is an "employee stock ownership plan" (as defined
in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code) has satisfied all of the applicable
requirements of Sections 409 and 4975(e)(7) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder in all  material respects.

 


 

 

(v) Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their  Subsidiaries, has any
obligations for post-employment welfare benefits under any Entegra Benefit
Plan that cannot be terminated upon 60 days or less notice without incurring
any Liability thereunder, except for coverage required by Part 6 of  Title I
of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or similar state Laws, the cost of which
is borne by the electing individuals.

 


 

 

(vi) All contributions and payments required to be made with  respect to any
Entegra Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any Entegra Benefit Plan, have been timely made or
paid in  full by the applicable due date, with extensions, or to the extent
not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully
reflected or reserved against in the Company Balance Sheet to the extent
required by GAAP or  regulatory accounting requirements. Any unfunded Entegra
Benefit Plan pays benefits solely from the general assets of the Company or
the Bank, or their applicable Subsidiary, for which arrangement the
establishment of a trust under ERISA is not  required.

 


 

 

(vii) All required reports, notices, disclosures, and descriptions 
(including without limitation Form 5500 annual reports and required
attachments, Forms 1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1, and summary
plan descriptions) have been timely filed or distributed in accordance with
applicable Law with  respect to each Entegra Benefit Plan. All required Tax
filings with respect to each Entegra Benefit Plan have been made, and any
Taxes due in connection with such filings have been paid. Since January 1,
2016, neither the Company nor the Bank,  nor any of their Subsidiaries, has
filed or been required to file with the IRS a Form 8928 in order to self-
report any health plan violations which are subject to excise taxes under
applicable provisions of the Code, and there are no facts or  circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to result in the Company or the Bank, or any
of their Subsidiaries, being required by the Code to file any such Form 8928.

 


 

 

(viii) Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their  Subsidiaries, is a
party to or bound by any Contract (including without limitation any severance,
change of control, change in control, salary continuation, or employment
agreement) that will, as a result or consequence of the execution or 
delivery of this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement, shareholder approval
of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or the consummation
of the transactions, including the Mergers or the Bank Merger, contemplated by
this  Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, either alone or in connection
with any other event, (A) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee, or independent contractor of the Company or the Bank, or of any of
their Subsidiaries, to  severance pay or change of control or other benefits,
or any increase in severance pay or other benefits (whether upon termination
of employment or termination of such Contract after the date hereof or
otherwise), (B) accelerate the time of  payment or vesting or trigger any
payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or
benefits under, increase the amount payable under, or trigger any withdrawal
liability under or any other material obligation pursuant  to any of the
Entegra Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default
under, any of the Entegra Benefit Plans, or (D) result in the payment of any
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code
or  the imposition of any Tax under Section 409A of the Code or the
forgiveness of any indebtedness.

 


 

 

(ix) Each Entegra Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred  compensation
plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in documentary
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and has been administered, as
applicable, (A) in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code during
the period  beginning October 1, 2004, through December 31, 2008, and (B) in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1, 2009.

 


 

 

 

 

27  


 

 

 

(x) No Person is entitled to receive any additional payment  (including
without limitation any Tax gross-up or similar payment) from the Company or
the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries as a result of the imposition of any
excise Taxes under Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by Section
409A of  the Code.

 


 

 

(xi) All Entegra Voluntary Plans satisfy the regulatory  safe-harbor
requirements provided by ERISA in order for such Entegra Voluntary Plans to be
considered not to be or to have been established, sponsored, or maintained by
the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries and not to constitute
an  "employee benefit plan" subject to ERISA.

 


 

 

 

 

(t) Real and Personal Property.

 


 

 

 

 

(i) Set forth on _Schedule 4.2(t)(i)_ of the Entegra Disclosure Memorandum is
a true, correct, and complete list (by street address) as of the date of this
Agreement of all real property owned by the Company or  the Bank or any of
their Subsidiaries, including without limitation property carried on the books
of the Bank as "other real estate owned" (the "Owned      Real
Property"), and all real property leased by the Company or the Bank or any of
their Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property,"      and together with
the Owned Real Property, collectively, the "Entegra Properties"). Except for
the Entegra Properties, as of the date of  this Agreement, neither the
Company nor the Bank nor any of their Subsidiaries holds any interest (fee,
leasehold, or otherwise) in any real property, other than interests as a
creditor in real property securing Bank Loans (as defined below).

 


 

 

(ii) The Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries have good and 
marketable title to all of the Owned Real Property (including any property
acquired in a judicial foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure or similar transfer), in each case free and clear of any and all
Liens, except  Permitted Liens. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
material unpaid bills or claims for work performed on or at the Entegra
Properties, except for such as are not yet due and payable. None of the Owned
Real Property is leased by the  Company or the Bank or any of their
Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(iii) Each lease pursuant to which the Company or the Bank or  their
Subsidiaries lease the Leased Real Property is valid, binding, enforceable,
and in full force and effect, and neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of
their Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party to
any such  lease, is in breach or default under or in violation of, in any
material respect, any provision of any such lease. The Entegra Parties have
previously delivered or made available to SmartFinancial a true, correct, and
complete copy of each such  lease, including any amendments thereto. The
Entegra Parties and their Subsidiaries are entitled to and have exclusive
possession of the Leased Real Property, and no parcel of Leased Real Property
is subject to any legally binding lease, tenancy,  or license or any legally
binding agreement to grant any such lease, tenancy, or license that materially
interferes or would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with the
Entegra Parties' or their Subsidiaries' occupancy or use of the  Leased Real
Property.

 


 

 

(iv) There is no Person in possession or occupation of, or who has  any
current right to possession or occupation of, the Entegra Properties other
than the Entegra Parties and their Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(v) Each of the Entegra Properties that is used or held for use by  the
Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the
business or operations of the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries
(the "Entegra Business Properties") is in reasonably good condition (normal
wear and tear excepted), conforms in all material respects with all applicable
ordinances, regulations, and zoning and other Laws, and is  reasonably
considered by the Entegra Parties and their Subsidiaries to be adequate for
the current business of the Entegra Parties and their Subsidiaries. To the
Knowledge of the Company, none of the buildings, structures, or other
improvements  located on any of the Entegra Business Properties encroaches
upon or over any adjoining parcel of real estate or any easement or right-of-
way, and none of the buildings, structures, or other improvements located on
any parcel adjoining the  Entegra Business Properties encroaches upon or over
any portion of the Entegra Business Properties. There are no easements of any
kind on, in respect of, or affecting the Entegra Business Properties that
materially affect the Entegra Parties' or  their Subsidiaries' use of or
right to use the Entegra Business Properties for the conduct of their
business.

 


 

 

 

 

28  


 

 

 

(vi) None of the Entegra Properties, nor any building, structure,  fixture,
or improvement thereon, is the subject of, or affected by, any condemnation,
taking, eminent domain, or inverse condemnation proceeding currently
instituted or pending, and the Company has no Knowledge that any of the
Entegra Properties,  or any such building, structure, fixture, or
improvement, will or may the subject of, or affected by, any such proceeding.
There are no special, general, or other assessment proceedings affecting the
Entegra Properties which, if as a result of  which a special, general, or
other assessment were imposed, would materially increase the cost of using and
operating the Entegra Properties as currently used and operated by the Entegra
Parties and their Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(vii) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Entegra  Properties are
located in any special flood hazard area or zone on any official flood hazard
map published by the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency or in
any wetland area as designated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, 
the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or any applicable state or
local agency. The Entegra Properties are appropriately zoned for each of the
purposes for which they are being used by the Entegra Parties and their
Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(viii) Neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their  Subsidiaries, has
experienced any material restriction in access to or from public roads or any
material restriction in access to any utilities, including without limitation
water, sewer, drainage, gas, electric, telephone, cable, and internet,  used
by the Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries in the operation of
their business as presently conducted; there is no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened governmental action that has prohibited
or materially  interfered with or would reasonably be expected to prohibit or
materially interfere with such access; and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no fact or condition exists which, with the passage of time or the giving of
notice, or both, would  reasonably be expected to result in the termination
of or material reduction or impairment of such access. All existing utilities
provided at the Entegra Properties are adequate in all material respects for
the Entegra Parties' and their  Subsidiaries' existing use and operation of
the Entegra Properties.

 


 

 

(ix) The Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries have good and marketable
title to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and clear of
any and all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. In each case except as,
individually  or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each lease pursuant
to which the Company or the Bank, or any of their Subsidiaries, leases
personal property is valid,  binding, enforceable, and in full force and
effect, and neither the Company nor the Bank, nor any of their Subsidiaries,
nor to the Knowledge of the Company any other party to any such lease, is in
default under or in breach or violation of any  provision of any such lease.
The personal property owned or leased by the Company and the Bank and their
Subsidiaries is in reasonably good condition, normal wear and tear excepted,
and is reasonably sufficient for the carrying on of the  business of the
Company and the Bank and their Subsidiaries in the ordinary course consistent
with past practice.

 


 

 

 

 

(u) Environmental Matters.

 


 

 

 

 

(i) Each of the Entegra Properties and each of the Entegra  Participation
Facilities is, and has been during the period of the Company's or the Bank's

Loan Property)  (A) relating to alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with or Liability under any Environmental Law or (B) relating to
the presence of or release into the environment of any Hazardous Substance,
whether or not occurring at or on an  Entegra Loan Property. Neither the

with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts as are
customary and prudent in accordance with industry practices. All policies  of
insurance currently held or maintained by or providing coverage for the
Company or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries are in full force and effect,
neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their Subsidiaries is in breach or
default under  any such insurance policy, and no event has occurred which,

their Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on the books of
the Entegra  Parties and their Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP. The
Entegra Parties and their Subsidiaries employ investment, securities,
commodities, risk management, and other similar policies, practices, and
procedures that the Entegra Parties and their  Subsidiaries reasonably
believe are prudent and reasonable in the context of their respective
businesses, and prior to the date of this Agreement, the Entegra Parties have
made available to SmartFinancial true, correct, and complete copies of or 
the material terms of such policies, practices, and procedures. Except for
restrictions that exist for securities that are classified as "held to
maturity" or that are pledged to other Persons, none of the investment
securities held by the Company  or the Bank or any of their Subsidiaries are
subject to any restriction (whether contractual, statutory, or otherwise) that
would reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of the entity
holding such investment securities freely to  dispose of such investment
securities at any time. Neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their
Subsidiaries is a party to or has agreed to enter into any exchange-traded or
over-the-counter equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, or other  swap,
forward, future, option, cap, floor, or collar, or any other Contract that is
a derivative contract (including various combinations thereof), or owns
securities that (i) are referred to generically as "structured notes," "high
risk mortgage  derivatives," "capped floating rate notes," or "capped
floating rate mortgage derivatives" or (ii) are likely to have changes in
value as a result of interest or exchange rate changes that materially exceed
normal changes in value attributable to  interest or exchange rate changes.

 


 

 

 

(bb) Securities Transactions. All offers and sales of securities by the
Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries were at all relevant times exempt

requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated

any director,  officer, or employee of the Company or the Bank or their
Subsidiaries, any Person related to any such director, officer, or employee by
blood, marriage, or adoption and residing in the same household, or any Person
who has been knowingly provided  material nonpublic information by any one or
more of any of the foregoing Persons, has purchased or sold, or caused to be

and applicable  Laws. Neither the Company nor the Bank nor any of their
Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of the Company any of the directors,
officers, or employees of the Company or the Bank or their Subsidiaries, have

records for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all material
respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

 


 

 

(ee) Tax Treatment of Mergers. The Company has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers,  taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" under the provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 


 

 

(ff) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, and OFAC. The Bank received a rating of
"Satisfactory" or better during its most recent examination or interim review
with respect to the CRA. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are  no facts
or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the Bank (i) to be
considered not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material respect with
the CRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a
rating  for CRA purposes by federal banking regulators of lower than
"Satisfactory," or (ii) to be considered to be operating in violation, in any
material respect, of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the USA PATRIOT
Act, any order issued with  respect to anti-money laundering by the United
States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any
other applicable anti-money laundering Law.

 


 

 

 

(gg) Internal Controls. The records, systems, controls, data, and information
of the Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained, and
operated  under means (including any electronic, mechanical, or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all means of access  thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that, either individually or in the
aggregate, had not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. The Company  (i) has implemented and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule  13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior

committee of the Company's board of directors (A) any significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's
ability to record,  process, summarize, and report financial information, and
(B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting. To the  knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to
believe that the Company's outside auditors and its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the  rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, at any time prior to the Closing Date.

Date. No written claim has ever been made against the SmartFinancial Parties
or any of their Subsidiaries by a taxing authority in a jurisdiction where

of the Code) have been duly withheld or collected and have been paid, to the
extent required, to the proper taxing authorities. The SmartFinancial Parties
and their Subsidiaries have complied  with all information reporting and
backup withholding requirements, including the maintenance of required
records, with respect to such amounts. The SmartFinancial Parties and their
Subsidiaries have paid all employer contributions and premiums  and filed all
Tax Returns with respect to any employee income Tax withholding, and social
security and unemployment Taxes and premiums, all in compliance with the
withholding provisions of the Code and other applicable Laws.

Entegra Parties true, correct, and complete copies of all SmartFinancial

all  audit reports, statements of deficiencies, and similar documents issued
by a taxing authority relating to the SmartFinancial Returns.

litigation, or other proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge of
SmartFinancial, threatened against or with respect to the SmartFinancial
Parties or any of their  Subsidiaries in respect of any Taxes or Tax matters,
and to the Knowledge of SmartFinancial there are no facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such audit,
investigation, examination, deficiency assessment,  refund litigation, or
other proceeding. There are no unsatisfied Liabilities for Taxes with respect
to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by the SmartFinancial
Parties or any of their Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes.  No
deficiencies have been asserted against the SmartFinancial Parties or any of
their Subsidiaries as a result of an examination by a taxing authority and no
issue has been raised by any examination conducted by any taxing authority
that, by  application of the same principles, might result, individually or
in the aggregate, in a proposed material deficiency for any other period not
so examined. There are no Liens for Taxes upon any of the properties or assets
of the SmartFinancial  Parties or any of their Subsidiaries, other than
Permitted Liens.

Subsidiaries to conduct its  business as currently conducted or the ability
of such Person to perform and carry out such Person's duties or
responsibilities.

 


 

 

(iii) Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has

or has provided services to SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their
Subsidiaries in any capacity  from participating in any SmartFinancial
Benefit Plan.

(s) Benefit Plans.

 


 

 

 

 

(i) As used in this Agreement, the term "SmartFinancial Benefit Plan" means

Plans").

 


 

 

 

 

45  


 

 

 

(ii) Other than routine claims for benefits, there is no pending  or, to the
Knowledge of SmartFinancial, threatened claim, litigation, action,
administrative action, suit, audit, arbitration, mediation, or other
proceeding relating to any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan. All of the
SmartFinancial Benefit Plans  comply in all material respects with applicable
requirements of ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws (including
without limitation the portability, privacy, and security provisions of the
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act of 1996, as amended; the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2009, as amended; the coverage
continuation requirements of Title X of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended; the Family and Medical Leave  Act, as
amended; the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, as amended; the Mental Health
Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, as amended; the Uniformed Services
Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, as amended; the Newborns' and Mothers'
Health  Protection Act of 1996, as amended; the Women's Health and Cancer
Rights Act, as amended; and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of
2008, as amended), and have been established, maintained, and administered in
compliance, in all  material respects, with all applicable requirements of
ERISA and the Code and other applicable Laws and the terms and provisions of
all documents, contracts, or agreements establishing the SmartFinancial
Benefit Plans or pursuant to which they  are maintained or administered. To
the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, there are no existing circumstances and no
event has occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan  intended to be tax-
qualified under Section 401 of the Code. No audit of any SmartFinancial
Benefit Plan by the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or any other
Governmental Entity is ongoing or to the Knowledge of SmartFinancial 
threatened, or was ongoing or closed or to the Knowledge of SmartFinancial
threatened at any time during the past five years. There has occurred no
"prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975
of the Code) with  respect to any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is likely
to result in, or has already resulted in, the imposition of any penalties or
Taxes upon SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries under
Section 502(i) of ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code.

 


 

 

(iii) No Liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has  been, or
is expected by SmartFinancial or its Subsidiaries to be, incurred with respect
to any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (a
"SmartFinancial Pension Plan"), or with respect to any "single-employer plan"
(as defined in Section 4001(a) of ERISA) currently or formerly maintained by
SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any ERISA Affiliate. No  SmartFinancial
Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the
most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof, and no notice of a 
"reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for which the
reporting requirement has not been waived has been required to be filed for
any SmartFinancial Pension Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date
of this Agreement.  Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, has provided or is required to provide security to any
SmartFinancial Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA
Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the  Code. Neither SmartFinancial
nor SmartBank, nor any of their Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, has
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan" as
defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

 


 

 

(iv) Each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension  benefit
plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (a "SmartFinancial  Qualified
Plan") has received a current favorable determination letter from the IRS (or,
in the case of an IRS pre-approved plan, the pre-approved plan has a current
IRS opinion or advisory letter upon which SmartFinancial or SmartBank,  as
applicable, is entitled to rely under applicable IRS guidance), and to the
Knowledge of SmartFinancial there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of any such favorable
determination  letter. Each SmartFinancial Qualified Plan, if any, that is an
"employee stock ownership plan" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code)
has satisfied all of the applicable requirements of Sections 409 and
4975(e)(7) of the Code and the  regulations thereunder in all material
respects.

 


 

 

(v) All contributions and payments required to be made with  respect to any
SmartFinancial Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any plan document or other
contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to
insurance policies funding any SmartFinancial Benefit Plan, have been timely 
made or paid in full by the applicable due date, with extensions, or to the
extent not required to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been
fully reflected or reserved against in the SmartFinancial Balance Sheet to the
extent  required by GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements. Any unfunded
SmartFinancial Benefit Plan pays benefits solely from the general assets of
SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or their applicable Subsidiary, for which
arrangement the establishment  of a trust under ERISA is not required.

 

 

 

46  


 

 

 

(vi) All required reports, notices, disclosures, and descriptions  (including
without limitation Form 5500 annual reports and required attachments, Forms
1099-R, summary annual reports, Forms PBGC-1, and summary plan descriptions)
have been timely filed or distributed in accordance with applicable Law with 
respect to each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan. All required Tax filings with
respect to each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan have been made, and any Taxes due
in connection with such filings have been paid. Since January 1, 2016, neither
SmartFinancial  nor SmartBank, nor any of their Subsidiaries, has filed or
been required to file with the IRS a Form 8928 in order to self-report any
health plan violations which are subject to excise taxes under applicable
provisions of the Code, and there are  no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of
their Subsidiaries, being required by the Code to file any such Form 8928.

 


 

 

(vii) Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their  Subsidiaries,
is a party to or bound by any Contract (including without limitation any
severance, change of control, change in control, salary continuation, or
employment agreement) that will, as a result or consequence of the execution
or  delivery of this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement, shareholder
approval of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or the
consummation of the transactions, including the Mergers or the Bank Merger,
contemplated by this  Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement, either alone
or in connection with any other event, (A) entitle any current or former
director, officer, employee, or independent contractor of SmartFinancial or
SmartBank, or of any of their Subsidiaries,  to severance pay or change of
control or other benefits, or any increase in severance pay or other benefits
(whether upon termination of employment or termination of such Contract after
the date hereof or otherwise), (B) accelerate the time of  payment or vesting
or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of
compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable under, or trigger
any withdrawal liability under or any other material obligation pursuant  to
any of the SmartFinancial Benefit Plans, (C) result in any breach or violation
of, or a default under, any of the SmartFinancial Benefit Plans, or (D) result
in the payment of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G  of the Code or the imposition of any Tax under Section 409A of
the Code or the forgiveness of any indebtedness.

 


 

 

(viii) Each SmartFinancial Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified  deferred
compensation plan" (as defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) is in
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and has been
administered, as applicable, (A) in good faith compliance with Section 409A of
the Code during the  period beginning October 1, 2004, through December 31,
2008, and (B) in compliance with Section 409A of the Code since January 1,
2009.

 


 

 

(ix) All SmartFinancial Voluntary Plans satisfy the regulatory  safe-harbor
requirements provided by ERISA in order for such SmartFinancial Voluntary
Plans to be considered not to be or to have been established, sponsored, or
maintained by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries and not
to  constitute an "employee benefit plan" subject to ERISA.

 


 

 

 

(t) Real and Personal Property.

 


 

 

(i) SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their Subsidiaries have good  and
marketable title to all real property owned by them as of the date of this
Agreement, including without limitation property carried on the books of
SmartBank as "other real estate owned" (the "SmartFinancial Owned Real
Property"), in each case free and clear of any and all Liens, except Permitted
Liens.

 


 

 

(ii) Each lease pursuant to which SmartFinancial or SmartBank or  their
Subsidiaries lease the real property leased by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or
their Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement (the
"SmartFinancial      Leased Real Property," and together with the
SmartFinancial Owned Real Property, collectively, the "SmartFinancial
Properties") is  valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect,
and neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank nor any of their Subsidiaries, nor to
the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, any other party to any such lease, is in
breach or default under or in  violation of, in any material respect, any
provision of any such lease. SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their
Subsidiaries are entitled to and have exclusive possession of the
SmartFinancial Leased Real Property, and no parcel of SmartFinancial  Leased
Real Property is subject to any legally binding lease, tenancy, or license or
any legally binding agreement to grant any such lease, tenancy, or license
that materially interferes or would reasonably be expected to materially
interfere with  the occupancy or use of such parcel of SmartFinancial Leased
Real Property by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or their Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

 

47  


 

 

(iii) Except for the SmartFinancial Properties, as of the date of  this
Agreement, neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank nor any of their Subsidiaries
holds any interest (fee, leasehold, or otherwise) in any real property, other
than interests as a creditor in real property securing SmartBank Loans (as
defined  below). To the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, there are no material
unpaid bills or claims for work performed on or at the SmartFinancial
Properties, except for such as are not yet due and payable.

 


 

 

(iv) Each of the SmartFinancial Properties that is used or held for  use by
SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with
the business or operations of SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their
Subsidiaries (the "SmartFinancial Business Properties") is in reasonably good
condition (normal wear and tear excepted), conforms in all material respects
with all applicable ordinances, regulations, and zoning and  other Laws, and
is reasonably considered by SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their
Subsidiaries to be adequate for the current business of SmartFinancial and
SmartBank and their Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, none of
the  buildings, structures, or other improvements located on any of the
SmartFinancial Business Properties encroaches upon or over any adjoining
parcel of real estate or any easement or right-of-way, and none of the
buildings, structures, or other  improvements located on any parcel adjoining
the SmartFinancial Business Properties encroaches upon or over any portion of
the SmartFinancial Business Properties. There are no easements of any kind on,
in respect of, or affecting the SmartFinancial  Business Properties that
materially affect SmartFinancial's or SmartBank's or their Subsidiaries' use
of or right to use the SmartFinancial Business Properties for the conduct of
their business.

 


 

 

(v) None of the SmartFinancial Properties, nor any building,  structure,
fixture, or improvement thereon, is the subject of, or affected by, any
condemnation, taking, eminent domain, or inverse condemnation proceeding
currently instituted or pending, and SmartFinancial has no Knowledge that any
of the  SmartFinancial Properties, or any such building, structure, fixture,
or improvement, will or may the subject of, or affected by, any such
proceeding. There are no special, general, or other assessment proceedings
affecting the SmartFinancial  Properties which, if as a result of which a
special, general, or other assessment were imposed, would materially increase
the cost of using and operating the SmartFinancial Properties as currently
used and operated by SmartFinancial and SmartBank  and their Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(vi) To the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, none of the SmartFinancial 
Properties are located in any special flood hazard area or zone on any
official flood hazard map published by the United States Federal Emergency
Management Agency or in any wetland area as designated by the United States
Army Corps of Engineers,  the United States Environmental Protection Agency,
or any applicable state or local agency. The SmartFinancial Properties are
appropriately zoned for each of the purposes for which they are being used by
SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their  Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

(vii) Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their  Subsidiaries,
has experienced any material restriction in access to or from public roads or
any material restriction in access to any utilities, including without
limitation water,  sewer, drainage, gas, electric, telephone, cable, and
internet, used by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries in
the operation of their business as presently conducted; there is no pending
or, to the Knowledge of  SmartFinancial, threatened governmental action that
has prohibited or materially interfered with or would reasonably be expected
to prohibit or materially interfere with such access; and, to the Knowledge of
SmartFinancial, no fact or condition  exists which, with the passage of time
or the giving of notice, or both, would reasonably be expected to result in
the termination of or material reduction or impairment of such access. All
existing utilities provided at the SmartFinancial  Properties are adequate in
all material respects for SmartFinancial's and SmartBank's and their
Subsidiaries' existing use and operation of the SmartFinancial Properties.

 


 

 

(viii) SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their Subsidiaries have good  and
marketable title to all personal property owned by them, in each case free and
clear of any and all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. In each case except
as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to  have a Material Adverse Effect on SmartFinancial, each lease
pursuant to which SmartFinancial or SmartBank, or any of their Subsidiaries,
leases personal property is valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and
effect, and neither  SmartFinancial nor SmartBank, nor any of their
Subsidiaries, nor to the Knowledge of SmartFinancial any other party to any
such lease, is in default under or in breach or violation of any provision of
any such lease. The personal property owned or  leased by SmartFinancial and
SmartBank and their Subsidiaries is in reasonably good condition, normal wear
and tear excepted, and is reasonably sufficient for the carrying on of the
business of SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their Subsidiaries in  the
ordinary course consistent with past practice.

valid, and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by the
Enforceability Exceptions.

 


 

 

(vi) To the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, there are no material  oral
modifications or amendments related to any Loans held by SmartFinancial or

servicing.

insurance currently held or maintained by or providing coverage for
SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of their Subsidiaries are in full force and
effect, neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank nor any of their Subsidiaries is
in breach  or default under any such insurance policy, and no event has
occurred which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a

any of such insurance policies.  All premiums due and payable under or with
respect to such insurance policies have been timely and fully paid, and all
claims thereunder have been filed in a timely fashion. There is no claim for
coverage by SmartFinancial or SmartBank or any of  their Subsidiaries pending
under any of such insurance policies as to which coverage has been questioned,
denied, or disputed. Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank nor any of their
Subsidiaries has received written notice of any termination of  (actual or
threatened), material premium increase with respect to, or material alteration
of coverage under any of such insurance policies.

 


 

 

(aa) Investment Securities; Derivatives. SmartFinancial and SmartBank and
their Subsidiaries have good title to all securities and commodities owned by

SmartBank or their Subsidiaries. Such securities and commodities are valued on
the books  of SmartFinancial and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP.
SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their Subsidiaries employ investment,
securities, commodities, risk management, and other similar policies,
practices, and procedures that  SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their
Subsidiaries reasonably believe are prudent and reasonable in the context of
their respective businesses, and prior to the date of this Agreement
SmartFinancial and SmartBank have made available to the  Entegra Parties
true, correct, and complete copies of or the material terms of such policies,
practices, and procedures. Except for restrictions that exist for securities
that are classified as "held to maturity" or that are pledged to other 
Persons, none of the investment securities held by SmartFinancial or SmartBank
or any of their Subsidiaries are subject to any restriction (whether
contractual, statutory, or  otherwise) that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair the ability of the entity holding such investment securities
freely to dispose of such investment securities at any time. Neither
SmartFinancial nor SmartBank nor any of their  Subsidiaries is a party to or
has agreed to enter into any exchange-traded or over-the-counter equity,
interest rate, foreign exchange, or other swap, forward, future, option, cap,
floor, or collar, or any other Contract that is a derivative  contract

of federal or state securities Laws.

thereto have been in compliance with such provisions of Law in all material
respects.

 


 

 

(dd) Fiduciary Accounts. SmartFinancial and SmartBank and their Subsidiaries
have properly administered all accounts, if any, for which they serve or  act
as a fiduciary, including without limitation accounts for which they serve as
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator, or

account are true and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect
the assets of such fiduciary account.

 


 

 

(ee) Tax Treatment of Mergers. SmartFinancial has no Knowledge of any fact or
circumstance that would reasonably be expected to prevent the Mergers, taken
together, from qualifying as a "reorganization" under the  provisions of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

 


 

 

(ff) CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, and OFAC. SmartBank received a rating of
"Satisfactory" or better during its most recent examination or interim review
with respect to the CRA. To the Knowledge of SmartFinancial, there  are no
facts or circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause SmartBank
(i) to be considered not to be in satisfactory compliance in any material
respect with the CRA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be
assigned a  rating for CRA purposes by federal banking regulators of lower
than "Satisfactory," or (ii) to be considered to be operating in violation, in
any material respect, of the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, as amended, the USA
PATRIOT Act, any order issued  with respect to anti-money laundering by the
United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control,

(gg) Internal Controls. The records, systems, controls, data, and information
of SmartFinancial and its Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained, and 
operated under means (including any electronic, mechanical, or photographic
process, whether computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership
and direct control of SmartFinancial or its Subsidiaries or accountants
(including all  means of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-
exclusive ownership and non-direct control that, either individually or in the
aggregate, had not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on  SmartFinancial. SmartFinancial (i) has implemented and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the  Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to SmartFinancial's outside
auditors and the audit committee of SmartFinancial's  board of directors (A)
any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely 
affect SmartFinancial's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
financial information, and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in
SmartFinancial's internal  controls over financial reporting. To the
knowledge of SmartFinancial, there is no reason to believe that
SmartFinancial's outside auditors and its principal executive officer and
principal financial officer will not be able to give the  certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, at any time
prior to the Closing Date.

SmartFinancial may, prior to the approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal by
SmartFinancial's shareholders, if the Company's board of directors or
SmartFinancial's board of directors, respectively, determines in good faith,
after consultation with  its outside legal and financial advisors, that the

result in a Superior Proposal, and subject to providing 48 hours prior written

or Item  1012(a) of Regulation M-A, or from making any disclosure to such
Party's shareholders required by applicable Law; provided, however, that
compliance by the  Company or SmartFinancial, or their respective boards of

way limit or modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules,
regulations, or applicable Law has  under any other provision of this

representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of such Party set forth
in this Agreement, provided, however, that no such notification shall (i)
affect the representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements of the
Parties, or the conditions to the obligations of  the Parties, contained in
this Agreement or (ii) be deemed to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Memoranda; (b) has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, either

Additionally, upon a Party receiving notice that any officer of such Party or
any of its Subsidiaries with a title of executive vice-president or higher
intends to terminate his or her employment  with such Party or any of its
Subsidiaries, such Party promptly shall give the other Parties notice of the
same. The failure of a Party to comply with this _Section 7.2_ shall not in
and of itself constitute the failure of any condition set forth in _Section
8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ to be satisfied unless  the underlying fact, event,
occurrence, circumstance, or condition would independently result in the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ to be
satisfied.

Section 7.3 _Access and Information_.

 


 

 

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and subject  to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, for the purpose of
SmartFinancial verifying the representations and warranties of the Company and
compliance by the Company with its covenants and agreements set forth herein,
and  preparing for the Mergers and the other matters contemplated by this
Agreement (including for purposes of integration planning), the Company shall,
and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford to SmartFinancial and SmartBank and
their  representatives (including their directors, officers, and employees
and financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants, and other professionals
retained by SmartFinancial or SmartBank) reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books,  records, Contracts, properties, assets,
personnel, and information technology systems of the Entegra Parties and their
Subsidiaries, as well as such other information relating to the Entegra
Parties or their Subsidiaries as SmartFinancial or  SmartBank may reasonably
request. Likewise, prior to the Effective Time, upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, for the
purpose of the Company verifying the representations and warranties of 
SmartFinancial and compliance by SmartFinancial with its covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and preparing for the Mergers and the other
matters contemplated by this Agreement (including for purposes of integration
planning),  SmartFinancial shall, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, afford
to the Entegra Parties and their representatives (including their directors,
officers, and employees and financial advisors, legal counsel, accountants,
and other professionals  retained by the Entegra Parties) reasonable access
during normal business hours to the books, records, Contracts, properties,
assets, and information technology systems of SmartFinancial and SmartBank and

or any of its  Subsidiaries from any Governmental Entity (other than any such
materials which are not permitted to be disclosed under applicable Law) and
(ii) such other information regarding such Party and its Subsidiaries and its
and their respective  businesses, properties, assets, liabilities, or
personnel as the other Parties may reasonably request.

 


 

 

 

(c) Any investigation by a Party or its representatives pursuant to  this
_Section 7.3_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the business operations of the Person being investigated. No
investigation by  the Parties or their representatives pursuant to this
_Section 7.3_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any of the representations,
warranties, covenants, or agreements  of the Parties set forth in this
Agreement. Neither SmartFinancial or the Company nor their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ where such access or disclosure would violate
or prejudice the rights of customers of SmartFinancial, SmartBank, or the
Entegra Parties, as the case may be, jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege  of the party in possession or control of such information (after
giving due consideration to the existence of any common interest, joint
defense, or similar agreement between the Parties), or contravene any Law,
fiduciary duty, or binding  Contract entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The Parties agree to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the immediately
preceding sentence apply.

 


 

 

(d) The Confidentiality Agreement, to the extent the same is not

in accordance with its terms, and each of SmartFinancial, on the one hand, and
the  Company, on the other hand, shall hold all information furnished by or
on behalf of the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or their

required by, and in accordance with,  the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 7.10 _Employee and Benefit Matters_.

 


 

 

 

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law and the terms of SmartFinancial's and 
SmartBank's employee benefit plans, SmartFinancial or SmartBank will, as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, provide employees of the
Bank who become employees of SmartBank at or immediately following the
Effective Time (the  "Continuing Employees") with benefits that are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to similarly situated
employees  of SmartBank as of the date of this Agreement. With respect to any
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by
SmartFinancial or SmartBank, excluding both any retiree health care plans or
programs maintained by  SmartFinancial or SmartBank and any equity
compensation or deferred compensation plans or arrangements maintained by
SmartFinancial or SmartBank (collectively, "Employee Plans"), in which any
Continuing Employees will participate effective as of or after the Effective
Time, SmartFinancial or SmartBank, as appropriate, will recognize all years of
full-time service of  Continuing Employees with the Bank for vesting and
eligibility purposes (but not for benefit accrual purposes or purposes of
early retirement subsidies under any Employee Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan) in any Employee Plan in which  such Continuing Employees may be
eligible to participate at or after the Effective Time; provided that such
service shall not be recognized to the extent  that (i) such recognition of
service would result in a duplication of benefits or (ii) such service was not
recognized under a corresponding Entegra Benefit Plan. With respect to
Employee Plans providing health care, dental, or vision coverage, 
SmartFinancial or SmartBank, as appropriate, will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or
other limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new
employees not  to apply to the Continuing Employees or their eligible spouses
and eligible dependents who were covered under a similar Entegra Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Further, if Continuing Employees
experience a transition in  health care, dental, or vision coverage during
the middle of a plan year, SmartFinancial or SmartBank, as appropriate, will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any successor Employee Plan
providing health care, dental, or vision coverage  for Continuing Employees
to give credit towards the satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation
and out-of-pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any
deductible, co-payment, or other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by 
Continuing Employees in respect of their participation in the corresponding
Entegra Benefit Plan during the plan year of the successor Employee Plan prior
to the transition effective date. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, to
the extent  permitted by applicable Law and the terms of any pertinent plan
documents, SmartFinancial and its Subsidiaries may after the Effective Time
maintain multiple benefit plans providing health care, dental, or vision
coverage and/or multiple  retirement savings plans.

 


 

 

 

 

65  


 

 

 

(b) At the request of SmartFinancial, the Company shall take, and  shall
cause its Subsidiaries to take, prior to the Effective Time, all actions
reasonably requested by SmartFinancial that are necessary or appropriate to
(i) cause one or more of the Entegra Benefits Plans (including those Entegra
Benefits Plans  set forth on _Schedule 7.10(b)_ of the SmartFinancial
Disclosure Memorandum) to terminate or be frozen as of or immediately prior to
the Effective  Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any
Entegra Benefit Plan to cease as of or immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (iii) cause the continuation at and after the Effective Time of any
insurance policy or other Contract  relating to any Entegra Benefit Plan for
such period as may be requested by SmartFinancial, or (iv) facilitate the
merger of any Entegra Benefit Plan into any employee benefit plan maintained
by SmartFinancial or its Subsidiaries. All  resolutions, notices, or other
documents adopted, issued, or executed in connection with the implementation
of this _Section 7.10(b)_ shall be subject to SmartFinancial's  prior review
and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

 


 

 

(c) SmartFinancial will, or will cause SmartBank to, provide to (i) 
employees of the Bank immediately prior to the Effective Time who are not
offered continued employment with SmartFinancial or one of its Subsidiaries
and (ii) Continuing Employees whose employment is involuntarily terminated by
SmartFinancial or  its Subsidiaries without cause during the six-month period
immediately following the Effective Time (collectively, "Severed
Employees"),  and who are not otherwise entitled to contractual or other
severance or change in control benefits, severance benefits in the amounts set
forth on _Schedule  7.10(c)_ of the SmartFinancial Disclosure Memorandum,
taking into account the number of years of full-time service of the Severed
Employees  with the Bank prior to the Effective Time and with SmartFinancial
and its Subsidiaries thereafter; provided that it shall be a condition to
payment of any  such severance benefits that the Severed Employee executes a
release of claims, which release shall be in a form that complies with Section
409A of the Code and is reasonably acceptable to SmartFinancial. Any such
payments of severance benefits  (including the timing of the same) shall be
in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. For purposes of this _Section
7.10(c)_ , "cause" shall have the same meaning as  provided in any written
employment agreement between any Severed Employee and SmartFinancial and/or
its Subsidiaries on the date such Severed Employee's employment is terminated,
or if no such definition or employment agreement exists, "cause"  shall mean
conduct amounting to (i) fraud or dishonesty against or to SmartFinancial or
its Subsidiaries, (ii) the Severed Employee's willful misconduct, repeated
refusal to follow the reasonable directions of his or her superiors, or
knowing  violation of Law in the course or scope of performance of services
to or for SmartFinancial or its Subsidiaries; (iii) repeated absences from
work without a reasonable excuse; (iv) intoxication with alcohol or drugs
while on the premises of  SmartFinancial or its Subsidiaries during regular
business hours; (v) a conviction or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a
felony or a crime involving dishonesty; or (vi) a material breach or violation
of the terms of any agreement to which the  Severed Employee and
SmartFinancial or its Subsidiaries are parties.

 


 

 

(d) This _Section 7.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of the Parties, and nothing in this _Section 7.10_ , express or implied,
shall  confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.10_. Nothing contained in
this _Section 7.10_ , express or implied, (i) shall be construed to establish,
amend, or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement, or arrangement or (ii)
shall alter or limit the ability of the  Surviving Corporation,
SmartFinancial, or SmartBank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, to amend, modify, or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement, or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored, or 
maintained by any of them. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
provisions of this _Section 7.10_ shall not create any right in any employee
of the Company or the  Bank or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or any
other Person, to continued employment with the Surviving Corporation,
SmartFinancial, or SmartBank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (and shall not limit the right of the  Surviving Corporation,
SmartFinancial, or SmartBank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, to terminate the employment of any employee), or any compensation
or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

Section 7.11 _Indemnification_.

 


 

 

 

 

(a) For a period of six years immediately following the Effective  Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each of the
current and former directors, officers, and employees of the Company and the
Bank and their Subsidiaries, determined as of immediately prior to the
Effective  Time (each, an "Indemnified Party"), against any and all costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),  judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages, amounts paid in settlement, and liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative,
arising out of or  relating to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including the negotiation, execution, or performance of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger), whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at, or after the  Effective Time, and based on or pertaining to the
fact that he or she was a director, officer, or employee of the Company or the
Bank or any of their Subsidiaries or was serving at the request of the Company
or the Bank or any of their  Subsidiaries as a director, officer, employee,
agent, trustee, or partner of another corporation, partnership, trust, joint
venture, employee benefit plan, or other entity, to the fullest extent such
Indemnified Party would have been entitled to  be so indemnified, defended,
and held harmless under the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable governing documents) of the Company and the Bank and their
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement (including the 
provisions thereof, if any, relating to the advancement of expenses).

 


 

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under  this
_Section 7.11_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Surviving Corporation of the same;
provided that the failure of the Indemnified Party to so notify the Surviving
Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any Liability it
may  have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually and
materially prejudice the Surviving Corporation (and then only to the extent of
such prejudice). In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation  (whether arising before, at, or after the Effective Time), (i)
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for
any legal expenses of other  counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that, (A) if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or (B) if counsel for the Indemnified Party  advises the Surviving
Corporation in writing that there are legal defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are different from or in addition to those available to
the Surviving Corporation or that there are issues which raise conflicts of 
interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party that make
joint representation inappropriate, the Indemnified Party may retain its own
legal counsel and the Surviving Corporation shall pay, as statements therefor
are  received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction unless
there are multiple Indemnified Parties who have conflicts of interest), (ii)
the Indemnified Party will  cooperate in the defense thereof, (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent, and (iv) the Surviving Corporation shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event a federal or  state banking agency or a
court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

 


 

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time the Company shall obtain, or shall  cause the
Bank to obtain, and after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain, a "tail" policy under the Entegra Parties' existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy providing coverage for a period of six
years  immediately after the Effective Time for Persons who are immediately
prior to the Effective Time covered by the Entegra Parties' existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (the "Tail Insurance"),
which Tail Insurance shall provide for at least the same coverage and coverage
amounts as, and contain terms and conditions not materially less advantageous
than,  those currently provided for by the Entegra Parties' existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy; provided, however, that,
without the prior written consent of SmartFinancial, the Entegra Parties shall
not expend for such Tail Insurance (for said six-year period) an amount in
excess of 250%  of the most recent annual premium paid by the Entegra Parties
for their existing directors' and officers' liability insurance policy.

 


 

 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors  or
assigns shall consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person and
shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger, or shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any other  Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation
assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section
7.11_.

 

 

 

67  


 

 

 

(e) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Section 7.11_ are
subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of the
FDIA (12 U.S.C. § 1828(k)) and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the
FDIC  (12 C.F.R. Part 359).

 


 

 

 

 

Section 7.12 _Estoppel Letters_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain and deliver to SmartFinancial prior to or at the
Closing a customary  estoppel letter, dated as of the Closing Date, executed
by the lessor of each parcel of Leased Real Property, the form and substance
of such estoppel letters to be satisfactory to SmartFinancial in its
reasonable discretion.

(a) As      soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, SmartFinancial and the Company will prepare and file with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and SmartFinancial will prepare and file
with the SEC the Registration  Statement (in which the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus), which in each case
shall comply with all of the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act (and the rules and regulations  thereunder) applicable
thereto. Each of SmartFinancial and the Company shall use reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as soon as practicable after the filing thereof. 
SmartFinancial shall also use reasonable best efforts to register or exempt
from registration the SmartFinancial Common Stock to be issued to holders of
Company Common Stock as Merger Consideration under the state securities or
"blue sky" Laws of  all applicable jurisdictions, and to keep the
Registration Statement and such state securities Laws or "blue sky"
registrations or exemptions current and in effect for so long as is necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement, and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the Entegra Parties and their
shareholders as may be reasonably requested by SmartFinancial in connection
with the same. SmartFinancial shall have primary responsibility for 
preparing and filing the Registration Statement, provided that SmartFinancial
shall to the extent practicable afford the Company and its legal, financial, 
and accounting advisors a reasonable opportunity to review and provide
comments on (i) the Registration Statement before it is filed with the SEC and
(ii) all amendments and  supplements to the Registration Statement and all
responses to requests for additional information and replies to comments
relating to the Registration Statement before the same are filed with or
submitted to the SEC. Each Party, to the extent  permitted by Law, shall
deliver to the other Parties copies of all material filings, correspondence,
orders, and documents with, to, or from Governmental Entities, and shall
promptly relay to the other Parties the substance of any material oral 
communications with, to, or from Governmental Entities, in each case
pertaining or relating to the Registration Statement or any documents or
materials related thereto.

 


 

 

(b) The      Parties shall cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the
purpose of submitting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
to the shareholders of the Company for approval and submitting the Stock
Issuance Proposal to the shareholders of SmartFinancial approval. Each Party
will as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this  Agreement
furnish all data and information relating to it and its Subsidiaries, and its
and its Subsidiaries' businesses, directors, officers, and shareholders, as
the other Parties may reasonably request for the purpose of including such
data  and information in the Registration Statement and/or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. The Company expressly agrees to cooperate with
SmartFinancial and its legal and accounting advisors in requesting and
obtaining appropriate opinions,  consents, and letters from its legal and
financial advisor(s) and independent auditor(s), and in taking such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by SmartFinancial , in connection with
the Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus. Without
limiting the generality of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company
shall cause Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, legal counsel to the Company, to issue
and deliver to the Company, in connection with the filing of  the
Registration Statement with the SEC, an opinion of counsel with respect to the
material United States federal income tax consequences of the Mergers and the
Entegra Special Dividend to holders of Company Common Stock. Each Party
covenants  and agrees that none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by such Party for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the
Registration Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto  becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto will, on the date the same is first mailed to
shareholders of SmartFinancial or the Company or at the  time of the
SmartFinancial Meeting or the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light
of  the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (iii)
any other document filed with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, at the time such document is
filed, fail to  comply as to form or substance, in all material respects,
with the provisions of applicable Law. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will comply as to form and substance, in all material respects, with all
applicable requirements of the  Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation or warranty is
made by any Party with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by  any other Party or its Subsidiaries
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Each Party covenants and agrees that, in the event such
Party becomes aware of any information furnished by it or any of  its
Subsidiaries that would cause any of the statements in the Registration
Statement or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or any other document filed
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement, to be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein not false or misleading, such Party will promptly inform the other
Parties thereof in writing  and take all necessary steps to correct the
Registration Statement or Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or other document,
as applicable.

Directors"). Provided that a Continuing Entegra Director continues to satisfy
the standards and requirements for service  on the SmartFinancial and
SmartBank boards of directors that are generally applicable to all directors,
the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation (or the appropriate
committee thereof) shall nominate such Continuing Entegra Director for 
reelection to the Surviving Corporation's board of directors at the first
annual meeting of the shareholders of the Surviving Corporation following the
Effective Time. Those members of the Company's board of directors immediately
prior to the  Effective Time who are not Continuing Entegra Directors will be
invited to serve on a local Carolina Advisory Board (the "Carolina Advisory 
Board") to be established by SmartBank following the Bank Merger.

 


 

 

Section 7.16 _Exemption from Section 16(b) Liability_. SmartFinancial and the
Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those
officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements
of  Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, both prior to and after the Effective
Time, it is desirable that such individuals not be subject to a risk of
liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law  in connection with the conversion or exchange of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Equity Awards in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions  of this _Section 7.16_. The board
of directors of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof
(as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)  under the Exchange
Act), shall prior to the Effective Time take all such action as may be
reasonably required to cause to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law,  any dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Equity
Awards that are treated as dispositions under such rule and result from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the
Company who is subject  to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The board of directors of SmartFinancial, or a committee of non-employee
directors thereof (as such term is  defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), shall prior to the Effective Time take all such
action as may be reasonably required to cause to be exempt from liability
pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to the fullest  extent
permitted by applicable Law, any acquisitions of shares of SmartFinancial
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to such shares)
that are treated as acquisitions under such rule and result from the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who may
become or is reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
SmartFinancial immediately after the Effective Time.

 


 

 

Section 7.17 _Takeover Laws_. Neither SmartFinancial or the Company nor their
respective boards of directors shall take any action that would cause any
Takeover Law to become applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers, the Bank
Merger,  or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall
take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) this
Agreement, the Mergers, the Bank Merger, and the other transactions
contemplated hereby from any  applicable Takeover Law now or hereafter in
effect. If any Takeover Law should become, or should purport to be, applicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party and its
respective board of directors will grant such  approvals and take such other
actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects 
of any Takeover Law on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, if necessary, challenging the validity or applicability of any such
Takeover Law.

Section 7.18 _Litigation and Claims_. Each of SmartFinancial and the Company
shall promptly notify the other Party in writing of any action, arbitration,

initiated, or commenced, or to the Knowledge of such Party threatened to be
instituted, initiated, or commenced, against such Party or any of its
directors, Subsidiaries, or Affiliates relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Each of SmartFinancial and the Company shall
give the other Party the opportunity to participate in (but not control), at
its own expense, the defense or settlement of any shareholder litigation
against such Party or any of its directors,  Subsidiaries, or Affiliates
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without such other Party's prior written consent
(which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

cause the Bank to,  cooperate with SmartFinancial and SmartBank in connection
with planning for the efficient and orderly combination of SmartFinancial and
the Company and SmartBank and the Bank and the operation of the Surviving
Corporation and Surviving Bank,  and in preparing for the consolidation of
appropriate operating functions and the conversion of the data processing and
related electronic  information technology systems of the Entegra Parties to
those used by SmartFinancial and SmartBank, effective as of the Effective Time
or such later date as determined by SmartFinancial.

 


 

 

Section 7.20 _Entegra Special Dividend; CVR Agreement_.

 


 

 

 

 

(a) In the event that the Entegra Parties settle that certain  dispute
identified on _Schedule 7.20_ of the Entegra Disclosure Memorandum (the
"Dispute") and receive all proceeds of such settlement prior to 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on the tenth Business Day prior to the Settlement Date (as
defined below), the Company shall use commercially  reasonable efforts to
declare and pay in accordance with this _Section 7.20_ , subject to compliance
with all applicable Laws (including applicable Nasdaq rules), a  one-time,
special cash dividend on the Company Common Stock in an amount up to, but not
exceeding, the after-tax net proceeds of such settlement actually received by
the Entegra Parties prior to the declaration of such dividend (the "Entegra
Special Dividend"), taking into account all costs and expenses incurred by the
Entegra Parties after December 31, 2018 (but not those  costs and expenses
incurred on or prior to December 31, 2018) in pursuing or in furtherance of
such settlement, including legal and accounting fees and expenses, and
assuming a combined federal and state income tax rate of 26%. If declared
and  paid, the Entegra Special Dividend must be declared and paid by the
Company prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the fifth Business Day prior to the
Closing Date (such date the "Settlement Date"). The Company shall cause Hunton
Andrews Kurth LLP, legal counsel to the Company (or such other legal counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Company and SmartFinancial), to issue and 
deliver to the Company, in connection with the filing of the Registration
Statement with the SEC, an opinion of counsel with respect to the material
United States federal income tax consequences of the Entegra Special Dividend
to holders of  Company Common Stock. In the event Dispute settlement proceeds
are received by the Entegra Parties but the Entegra Special Dividend is not
declared and paid prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Settlement Date, then
such settlement proceeds  shall constitute "Claims Proceeds" for purposes of
(and as defined in) the CVR Agreement.

 


 

 

(b) In the event that the Entegra Parties do not settle the  Dispute, receive
all proceeds of such settlement, and declare and pay the Entegra Special
Dividend prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Settlement Date as provided in
_Section 7.20(a)_ , then (i) prior to or at the Closing, SmartFinancial and
the Company will execute and deliver the CVR Agreement, and SmartFinancial and
the Company will use  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the initial
committee members identified in the CVR Agreement and the paying agent
mutually agreed upon by SmartFinancial and the Company to execute and deliver
the CVR Agreement, and (ii) SmartFinancial  and the Company will use
commercially reasonable efforts (including making reasonable revisions to the
form of CVR Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ ) to ensure  that the
CVRs are not subject to registration under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, or any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws and to cause the
CVRs to be issued as part of the Merger Consideration.

(c) In the event that the Entegra Parties settle the Dispute,  receive all
proceeds of such settlement, and declare and pay the Entegra Special Dividend
prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the Settlement Date as provided in _Section
7.20(a)_ (the "Dispute Resolution Condition"), then the  CVR Agreement will
not be executed and delivered by SmartFinancial and the Company and the other
parties thereto and no CVRs will be issued as part of the Merger Consideration
in accordance with _Section 3.1_.

 


 

 

 

 

Section 7.21 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Prior to the Effective Time, each
of SmartFinancial and the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary
for SmartFinancial to, as of the Effective Time, acquire from and succeed to
all  rights, title, and interests of the Company in the TPS Trust, including
the issued and outstanding common securities of the TPS Trust, and assume the
Company's covenants, agreements, and obligations under and relating to the
Trust Preferred  Securities and the Trust Debentures, in each case in

Section 7.22 _SmartBank Foundation Contribution_. Consistent with
SmartFinancial's commitment to community investment and to the banking markets
served by the Bank, at Closing, SmartFinancial will contribute $1,000,000 (the
"Contributed Funds") to the SmartBank Foundation, a 501(c)(3) charitable
organization chartered under Tennessee law. The allocation of the 
Contributed Funds will be directed by recommendation of the Carolina Advisory
Board (in consultation with the President of the Carolinas for SmartBank) to
qualifying 501(c)(3) charitable organizations in the banking markets served by
the Bank  within the three-year period immediately following the Effective

once.

FORM OF ENTEGRA VOTING AGREEMENT

 


 

 

[attached]

 


 

   


 

 

VOTING AGREEMENT

 


 

 

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated January 15,  2019, is
entered into by and between SmartFinancial, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("
_SmartFinancial_ "), and [●] (the " _Shareholder_ ").

 


 

 

_R_ _E_ _C_ _I_ _T_ _A_ _L_ _S_

 


 

 

A. Concurrently with the parties' execution of this Agreement, 
SmartFinancial, CT Merger Sub, Inc., a North Carolina corporation and direct,
wholly owned subsidiary of SmartFinancial (" _Merger Sub_ " and together with
SmartFinancial,  collectively, the " _SmartFinancial Parties_ "), and Entegra
Financial Corp., a North Carolina corporation (the " _Company_ "),     
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended
from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") providing for, among other
things, the merger of  Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
") and the conversion of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (as
defined below) into the right to receive the  Merger Consideration.

 


 

 

B. As a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger  Agreement,
the SmartFinancial Parties have required that the Shareholder execute and
deliver this Agreement.

 


 

 

C. In order to induce the SmartFinancial Parties to enter into the  Merger
Agreement, the Shareholder is willing to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants, and agreements with respect to the shares of common
stock, no par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") "beneficially
owned" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 (" _Rule 13d-3_ ") promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission  (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by the Shareholder and identified below the
Shareholder's signature on the signature page to this  Agreement (the "
_Owned Shares_ ," and together with any additional shares of Company Common
Stock or any  other class or series of capital stock of the Company
contemplated by _Section 7_ hereof, the " _Shares_ ").

 


 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of  which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 


 

 

1. _Defined      Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 


 

 

2. _Representations      of Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents and warrants to SmartFinancial that:

 


 

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder is the  beneficial
owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) of the Owned Shares.

 


 

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder does not  beneficially
own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) any shares of Company Common Stock, or
any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company, other
than the Owned Shares.

 


 

 

(c) The Shareholder has all necessary legal power and authority and  legal
capacity to enter into, execute, and deliver this Agreement and to perform
fully the Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid, and  binding obligation of the Shareholder enforceable against
the Shareholder in accordance with its terms.

 


 

     


 

 

3. _Agreement      to Vote Shares_. The Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, during the term of this Agreement as specified in _Section 8_ below, the  Shareholder will vote the Shares, and will cause any holder of record of the Shares to vote the Shares, (a) in favor of approval of (i) the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, at every meeting of the shareholders of the  Company at which such matters are considered and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone any such meeting of the shareholders of the Company, if necessary to solicit additional proxies (1) to  secure the quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting or (2) in favor of approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and (b) against (i) any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) any action, proposal,  transaction, agreement, or other matter which would or would reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the  Shareholder under this Agreement; provided, however, that, if the  manner in which the Shares (or any portion thereof) are owned is such that the Shareholder does not have the right to cause the Shares to be so voted, the Shareholder shall use the Shareholder's best efforts to cause the Shares to be so voted; provided further, however, that there is no obligation hereunder to  exercise any options or convert any convertible securities in order to obtain the right to vote any shares of Company capital stock.

 


 

 

4. _No      Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in SmartFinancial any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership, and economic  benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain with and belong to the Shareholder.

 


 

 

5. _No      Voting Trust or Other Arrangement_. The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder will not, and will not permit any Person under the Shareholder's control to, deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy with respect to  the Shares inconsistent with the intent of this Agreement, or subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Shares, other than agreements entered into with the SmartFinancial Parties.

 


 

 

6. _Transfer      and Encumbrance_. The Shareholder agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, the Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange, assign, or otherwise dispose of (collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any of the Shares, or enter into any contract, option, or other agreement or arrangement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of any of the Shares or the  Shareholder's voting or economic interest therein; provided, however,  that this _Section 6_ shall not prohibit (i) a Transfer of the Shares by the Shareholder if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in a written  instrument, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to SmartFinancial, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement (including without limitation the provisions of _Section       3_ hereof pertaining to the voting of the Shares); (ii) a Transfer of the Shares by will or by operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; or (iii) a Transfer of the Shares by the Shareholder to the  Company in connection with the vesting, settlement, or exercise of Company Equity Awards. Any attempted Transfer of the Shares or any interest therein in violation of this _Section 6_   shall be null and void.

 


 

 

7. _Additional      Shares_. The Shareholder agrees that all shares of Company Common Stock, and all shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company, that the Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote (other than as a named  proxy), or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) of after the Shareholder's execution of this Agreement (including without limitation any shares of Company capital stock issued as a dividend or in connection with a stock split or other distribution, recapitalization, or reclassification or shares issuable upon the conversion, vesting, settlement, or exercise of any warrant, right,  option, restricted stock, restricted stock unit, or restricted share award, or other security) shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute "Shares" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

2  


 

 

8. _Termination_.       The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby by the shareholders of the  Company in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and applicable Law or (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon the termination of this Agreement, no party hereto shall have  any further obligations or liability hereunder; provided, however,  that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve a party hereto of any liability for any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement.

 


 

 

9. _No      Agreement as Director or Officer_. The Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in the Shareholder's capacity as a director or officer of the Company. The Shareholder has executed this Agreement solely in his or her  capacity as a beneficial owner of the Shares, and nothing in this Agreement (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the Shareholder in the Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under  the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement, or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit, or restrict the Shareholder from exercising the Shareholder's fiduciary duties as a director or officer  of the Company.

 


 

 

10. _Specific      Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the other party if such party fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed on such party by this Agreement, that every  such obligation is material, and that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law or adequate damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy (including  the remedy of specific performance), in addition to remedies at law and/or damages, is an appropriate remedy for any such failure and that it will not oppose the seeking of such relief on the basis that a party has an adequate remedy at law. Each  party hereto agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the other party seeking or obtaining any such equitable relief or remedy.

 


 

 

11. _Entire      Agreement; Amendment; Waivers_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire, integrated agreement between the parties  with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any provision  hereof by a party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 


 

 

12. _Disclosure_.       The Shareholder expressly authorizes SmartFinancial and its Affiliates and the Company and its Affiliates to publish and disclose in any announcement, filing, or disclosure required by the SEC, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any other  filings made with a Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, the Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement.

 


 

 

13. _Miscellaneous_.

 


 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in 
accordance with the Laws of the State of Tennessee, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Tennessee or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws
of any jurisdiction  other than those of the State of Tennessee.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal  action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement or the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
brought by the  other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined exclusively in a Tennessee state court located in Nashville,
Davidson County, Tennessee, or the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Tennessee, Nashville  Division. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits, with regard to any such action or proceeding, for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees  that it will not bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court or tribunal other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and 
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, by counterclaim, or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the
rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment in  respect of this Agreement or the rights and obligations

VOTING AGREEMENT

 


 

 

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated January 15,  2019, is
entered into by and between Entegra Financial Corp., a North Carolina
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and [●] (the " _Shareholder_ ").

 


 

 

_R_ _E_ _C_ _I_ _T_ _A_ _L_ _S_

 


 

 

A. Concurrently with the parties' execution of this Agreement, the  Company,
SmartFinancial, Inc., a Tennessee corporation (" _SmartFinancial_ "), and CT
Merger Sub, Inc., a North Carolina corporation and direct, wholly owned
subsidiary of  SmartFinancial (" _Merger Sub_ " and together with
SmartFinancial, collectively, the " _SmartFinancial Parties_ "),     
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended
from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ ") providing for, among other
things, the merger of  Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
") and the conversion of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (as
defined below) into the right to receive the  Merger Consideration.

 


 

 

B. As a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger  Agreement, the
Company has required that the Shareholder execute and deliver this Agreement.

 


 

 

C. In order to induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement,  the
Shareholder is willing to make certain representations, warranties, covenants,
and agreements with respect to the shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of SmartFinancial (" _SmartFinancial Common Stock_ ") "beneficially
owned" (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 (" _Rule 13d-3_ ") promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange  Commission (the " _SEC_ ") under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) by the Shareholder and identified below the
Shareholder's signature on the signature page to  this Agreement (the "
_Owned Shares_ ," and together with any additional shares of SmartFinancial
Common  Stock or any other class or series of capital stock of SmartFinancial
contemplated by _Section 7_ hereof, the " _Shares_ ").

 


 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of  which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 


 

 

1. _Defined      Terms_. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement.

 


 

 

2. _Representations      of Shareholder_. The Shareholder represents and warrants to the Company that:

 


 

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder is the  beneficial
owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) of the Owned Shares.

 


 

 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder does not  beneficially
own (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) any shares of SmartFinancial Common
Stock, or any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of
SmartFinancial, other than the Owned Shares.

 


 

 

(c) The Shareholder has all necessary legal power and authority and  legal
capacity to enter into, execute, and deliver this Agreement and to perform
fully the Shareholder's obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes the
legal, valid, and  binding obligation of the Shareholder enforceable against
the Shareholder in accordance with its terms.

 


 

     


 

 

3. _Agreement      to Vote Shares_. The Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, during the term of this Agreement as specified in _Section 8_ below, the  Shareholder will vote the Shares, and will cause any holder of record of the Shares to vote the Shares, (a) in favor of approval of (i) the issuance by SmartFinancial of the shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock constituting the Merger  Consideration pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement (the " _Stock Issuance Proposal_ "), at every meeting of the shareholders of SmartFinancial at which the Stock  Issuance Proposal is considered and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone any such meeting of the shareholders of SmartFinancial, if necessary to solicit additional proxies (1) to secure the  quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting or (2) in favor of approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal, and (b) against (i) any Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) any action, proposal, transaction, agreement, or other matter which would or  would reasonably be expected to result in a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or other obligation or agreement of SmartFinancial under the Merger Agreement or of the Shareholder under this Agreement; provided, however, that, if the manner in which the Shares (or any  portion thereof) are owned is such that the Shareholder does not have the right to cause the Shares to be so voted, the Shareholder shall use the Shareholder's best efforts to cause the Shares to be so voted; provided further, however, that there is no obligation hereunder to exercise any options or  convert any convertible securities in order to obtain the right to vote any shares of SmartFinancial capital stock.

 


 

 

4. _No      Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in the Company any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership, and economic benefits  of and relating to the Shares shall remain with and belong to the Shareholder.

 


 

 

5. _No      Voting Trust or Other Arrangement_. The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder will not, and will not permit any Person under the Shareholder's control to, deposit any of the Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxy with respect to  the Shares inconsistent with the intent of this Agreement, or subject any of the Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Shares, other than agreements entered into with the Company.

 


 

 

6. _Transfer      and Encumbrance_. The Shareholder agrees that, during the term of this Agreement, the Shareholder will not, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange, assign, or otherwise dispose of (collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any of the Shares, or enter into any contract, option, or other agreement or arrangement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of any of the Shares or the  Shareholder's voting or economic interest therein; provided, however,  that this _Section 6_ shall not prohibit (i) a Transfer of the Shares by the Shareholder if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in a written  instrument, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement (including without limitation the provisions of _Section 3_   hereof pertaining to the voting of the Shares); (ii) a Transfer of the Shares by will or by operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee; or (iii) a Transfer of the Shares by the Shareholder to SmartFinancial in  connection with the vesting, settlement, or exercise of SmartFinancial Equity Awards. Any attempted Transfer of the Shares or any interest therein in violation of this _Section 6_   shall be null and void.

 


 

 

7. _Additional      Shares_. The Shareholder agrees that all shares of SmartFinancial Common Stock, and all shares of any other class or series of capital stock of SmartFinancial, that the Shareholder purchases, acquires the right to vote (other than as  a named proxy), or otherwise acquires beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3) of after the Shareholder's execution of this Agreement (including without limitation any shares of SmartFinancial capital stock issued as a dividend or in connection with a stock split or other distribution, recapitalization, or reclassification or shares issuable upon the conversion, vesting, settlement, or exercise of any warrant,  right, option, restricted stock, restricted stock unit, or restricted share award, or other security) shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall constitute "Shares" for all purposes of this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

2  


 

 

8. _Termination_.       The term of this Agreement shall commence on the date of this Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal by the shareholders of SmartFinancial or (b) the termination of  the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms. Upon the termination of this Agreement, no party hereto shall have any further obligations or liability hereunder; provided, however, that the termination of this Agreement shall not relieve a party hereto of any liability for any breach of this  Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this Agreement.

 


 

 

9. _No      Agreement as Director or Officer_. The Shareholder makes no agreement or understanding herein in the Shareholder's capacity as a director or officer of SmartFinancial. The Shareholder has executed this Agreement solely in his or her  capacity as a beneficial owner of the Shares, and nothing in this Agreement (a) will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the Shareholder in the Shareholder's capacity as such a director or officer, including in exercising rights under  the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement, or (b) will be construed to prohibit, limit, or restrict the Shareholder from exercising the Shareholder's fiduciary duties as a director or officer  of SmartFinancial.

 


 

 

10. _Specific      Performance_. Each party hereto acknowledges that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to the other party if such party fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed on such party by this Agreement, that every  such obligation is material, and that, in the event of any such failure, the other party will not have an adequate remedy at law or adequate damages. Accordingly, each party hereto agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy (including  the remedy of specific performance), in addition to remedies at law and/or damages, is an appropriate remedy for any such failure and that it will not oppose the seeking of such relief on the basis that a party has an adequate remedy at law. Each  party hereto agrees that it will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond in connection with the other party seeking or obtaining any such equitable relief or remedy.

 


 

 

11. _Entire      Agreement; Amendment; Waivers_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire, integrated agreement between the parties  with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented, and no provisions hereof may be modified or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. No waiver of any provision  hereof by a party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

 


 

 

12. _Disclosure_.       The Shareholder expressly authorizes the Company and its Affiliates and SmartFinancial and its Affiliates to publish and disclose in any announcement, filing, or disclosure required by the SEC, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and any other  filings made with a Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, the Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement.

 


 

 

13. _Miscellaneous_.

 


 

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in 
accordance with the Laws of the State of Tennessee, without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Tennessee or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws
of any jurisdiction  other than those of the State of Tennessee.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal  action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement or the rights and obligations arising hereunder,
brought by the  other party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and
determined exclusively in a North Carolina state court located in Charlotte,
Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, or the United States District Court for
the Western District of North  Carolina, Charlotte Division. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits, with regard to any such action or
proceeding, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the  aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties
hereto  hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, by counterclaim, or otherwise, in any action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition or  enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement or the rights and obligations arising hereunder, (i)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named courts for any reason, (ii) any claim that it or its  property is
exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such courts or from any legal
process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of  judgment, or otherwise), and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (1) the action or proceeding in
such courts is brought in an inconvenient forum, (2) the venue of such action
or proceeding is improper, or (3)  this Agreement, or the subject matter
hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 


 

 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY  ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND, THEREFORE, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING  TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,

EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF

PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT  BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13(C)_.

 


 

 

(d) If any term or provision of this Agreement is determined to be  invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any
other  jurisdiction. Upon any determination that any term or provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as  closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby can be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 


 

 

(e) This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of  which
shall be deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. A facsimile or other electronic copy
of a signature page to this Agreement shall be deemed to be, and shall have
the same force  and effect as, an original signature page.

obligations hereunder may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party, and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall  be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this

CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS AGREEMENT

 


 

 

AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"),       dated as of [●], 2019, by and among
Entegra Financial Corp., a North Carolina corporation ("Cherokee"), [●], [●]
and [●] as the initial  Committee Members, and [●], as Rights Agent, and
SmartFinancial, Inc., a Tennessee corporation ("Smokey").

 


 

 

WITNESSETH:

 


 

 

WHEREAS, Smokey, CT Merger Sub, Inc., a North Carolina corporation ("Merger
Sub"), and Cherokee have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of January 15, 2019 (as may be amended and restated from time to time, the
"Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into
Cherokee, with Cherokee surviving the Merger as a Subsidiary of Smokey (the
"First Merger");

 


 

 

WHEREAS, subsequent to the First Merger, Cherokee will merge with and into
Smokey, with Smokey surviving the Merger (the "Second Merger");

 


 

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Smokey has agreed to provide to
Cherokee's shareholders the right to receive contingent  cash payments,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein (each right, a "CVR" and
collectively, the "CVRs");

 


 

 

WHEREAS, Cherokee and the Committee desire the Pursuit of the Claims to be
managed, administered and controlled by the Committee,  Cherokee (prior to
the Second Merger) and Smokey (subsequent to the Second Merger), in accordance
with this Agreement; and

 


 

 

WHEREAS, Cherokee, Smokey and the Committee desire the Rights Agent to
establish an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") and make certain payments
as directed by the Committee in accordance with this Agreement.

 


 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements herein,
Cherokee, Smokey, the initial Committee Members and  the Rights Agent hereby
agree as follows:

 


 

 

ARTICLE I

 

_CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS_

 


 

 

Section 1.01 _CVRs_. The CVRs represent the rights of Holders to receive
contingent cash payments pursuant to this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 1.02 _No Certificates_. The CVRs shall not be evidenced by a
certificate or other instrument.

 


 

 

Section 1.03 _CVR Register_.

 


 

 

(a) _CVR Register_. The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the "CVR
Register") for the registration of CVRs. The  Rights Agent shall register
CVRs and transfer CVRs as herein provided.

 


 

 

(b) _Procedure for Limited Transfer_. Subject to the restrictions on
transferability set forth in _Section 1.05_ , every request made to transfer
a  CVR must be in writing and accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Rights Agent pursuant to its
guidelines, duly executed by the Holder thereof, the Holder's attorney duly
authorized in writing,  the Holder's personal representative or the Holder's
survivor, and setting forth in reasonable detail the circumstances relating to
the transfer. Upon receipt of such written notice, the Rights Agent will,
subject to its reasonable  determination that the transfer instrument is in
proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and
conditions of this Agreement, register the transfer of the CVR in the CVR
Register. The Company and the Rights Agent may  require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any stamp or other Tax or governmental charge that is
imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer. The Rights Agent
shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under any  section of
this Agreement that requires the payment by a Holder of a CVR of applicable
Taxes or charges unless and until the Rights Agent is satisfied that all such
Taxes or charges have been paid. All duly transferred CVRs registered in the 
CVR Register will be the valid obligations of the Company and will entitle the
transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held
immediately prior to the transfer by the transferor. No transfer of a CVR will
be  valid until registered in the CVR Register in accordance with this
Agreement.

 


 

 

 

1  


 

 

(c) _Address Change_. A Holder may make a written request to the Rights Agent
to change such Holder's address of record on the CVR Register. The written
request must be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such  written
request by the Rights Agent, the Rights Agent shall promptly record the change
of address on the CVR Register. The Rights Agent shall provide a copy of the
CVR Register to the Company upon request.

 


 

 

Section 1.04 _Rights of CVR Holder_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed as conferring upon any Holder, by virtue of being a Holder of a
CVR, the right to dividends or the right to vote or to consent or to  receive
notice as a shareholder in respect of the meetings of shareholders or the
election of directors of Cherokee or Smokey or any of their respective
Affiliates, or any other rights of any kind or nature whatsoever as a
shareholder of any of  the foregoing entities, either at law or in equity.
The rights of a Holder are limited to those expressed in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Merger Agreement to the contrary,
none of Smokey, Cherokee or any of their  respective Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, employees, or Affiliates shall have any liability, responsibility or
obligation of any kind to any Holders in their capacity as such on any basis
(including in contract, tort, under federal or state  securities law or
otherwise) with respect to, arising out of, or relating to this Agreement, the
CVRs, the Claims and the Pursuit thereof, except to the extent this Agreement
expressly requires the payment of any CVR Payment Amount to the  Holders and
except to the extent otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 1.05 _Non-Transferability_. The CVRs may not be sold, assigned,
transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner transferred or
disposed of, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, other than through
a  Permitted Transfer or pursuant to _Section 1.06_. Any attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, pledge, encumbrance or disposition of CVRs, in whole or
in part, in  violation of this _Section 1.05_ shall be void ab initio and of
no effect.   In addition, each Holder, by virtue of its acceptance of a CVR,
shall be deemed to have agreed to not facilitate or recognize any attempt by
any beneficial owner of such CVR to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber
or in any other manner  transfer or dispose of, in whole or in part, directly
or indirectly, an interest in such CVR other than through a Permitted
Transfer. A "Permitted      Transfer" shall mean (a) a transfer of a CVR
upon death of a Holder by will or intestacy; or (b) a transfer made by
operation of law (such as a merger); provided that any such transferred CVR
shall remain subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
this _Section 1.05_.

 


 

 

Section 1.06 _Ability to Abandon CVR_. A Holder may at any time, at such
Holder's option, abandon all of such Holder's remaining rights in a CVR by
transferring such CVR to the Company without consideration therefor. Nothing
in  this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or any of its Affiliates from
offering to acquire or from acquiring any CVRs for consideration from the
Holders, in private transactions or otherwise, in its sole discretion. Any
CVRs acquired by the  Company or any of its Affiliates (a) shall be
automatically deemed extinguished and no longer outstanding in the name of the
abandoning Holder and (b) shall entitle the Company to share in the
distributions thereon made under this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

_CVR COMMITTEE_

 


 

 

Section 2.01 _Establishment_. Each Holder, by virtue of its acceptance of a
CVR, shall be deemed to have consented and agreed to (a) the establishment of
a CVR Committee (the "Committee"), consisting of three (3) members ("Committee
Members") and having  the powers, authority and rights set forth in this
Agreement, (b) the appointment of the three individuals identified on Exibihit
III (the       "Initial Committee Members"), and (c) the appointment of
any successor Committee Member pursuant to _Section 2.04_.

 


 

 

Section 2.02 _Authority_.

 


 

 

(a) The Committee shall have full power and authority, and  shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, to prosecute, appeal, negotiate, resolve,
settle, compromise or otherwise pursue or defend any Claims (as defined
below), in whole or in part, on behalf and in the name of Cherokee and/or
Smokey, in  accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, including by
litigation in trial or appellate courts, arbitration, alternative dispute
resolution, mediation, negotiation, settlement or compromise (collectively,
the "Pursuit" of Claims) and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Committee shall have full power and authority to (i) initiate
or defend any  claims (including determining the timing thereof and the
strategy therefor), in each case, arising out of or in connection with the
claims described on Exhibit I, including claims relating to any potentially
available insurance proceeds for such transactions or litigation
(collectively, the "Claims"), (ii) direct and supervise all matters involving
litigation of any Claims (including trial strategy and planning, appellate
strategy and settlement strategy), (iii) appear before and  conduct affairs
with arbitrators, mediators and other such professionals on behalf and in the
name of Cherokee or Smokey necessary or appropriate to enable the Committee to
Pursue any Claims, (iv) appear in court and file pleadings and execute  any
documents on behalf and in the name of Cherokee or Smokey necessary or
appropriate to enable the Committee to Pursue any Claims, (v) agree to the
settlement or compromise of any Claim, subject to the consent right set forth
in _Section 3.04_ , and (vi) incur and pay out of the Escrow Account all fees,
costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) that
it deems necessary or  appropriate in Pursuit of the Claims. The Committee
shall maintain, and deliver to the Company upon request at any time, all
financial or other documentation reasonably necessary to sufficiently support
any fees, costs, or expenses so incurred  and/or paid. If, notwithstanding
the authority granted to the Committee under this Agreement, the Company
incurs and is invoiced for any fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys'
fees and expenses) in connection with the Claims, the  Company may submit the
invoice for such fees, costs, or expenses to the Committee and the Committee
shall pay such amounts within thirty (30) days of receipt of such invoice but
in no event later than the due date specified in such invoice.

 


 

 

(b) The Committee shall have reasonable access to, and control  over, the
attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrine that belongs to
Cherokee and/or any of its successors, assigns or subsidiaries to the extent
necessary to carry out any of the Committee's duties or obligations.

 


 

 

(c) The Committee shall have full power and authority to  withdraw all or
part of any Claims if the Committee reasonably determines that the sum of (i)
the aggregate amount of unpaid Claims Expenses together with (ii) the Claims
Expenses reasonably expected to be incurred exceed the sum of (A) the  amount
remaining in the Escrow Account together with (B) the Claims Proceeds
reasonably likely to still be collected. The Committee shall consider in good
faith any request by any Committee Member to take action pursuant to this
_Section 2.02(c)_.

 


 

 

(d) The Committee shall have full power and authority to  retain advisors,
including counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts, consultants,
investigators and other agents (collectively, "Advisors"),       in
connection with the Pursuit of Claims or the withdrawal or termination thereof
and to advise the Committee Members with respect to the rights and obligations
of the parties under this Agreement, including such power and authority to
(i)  direct and supervise all such Advisors and (ii) determine the amount and
method of compensation to be paid to such Advisors (including the settlement
of any disputes regarding such compensation). Any such compensation shall be
paid by the  Committee out of the Escrow Account.

 


 

 

 

3  


 

 

(e) The Committee shall use reasonable best efforts, including  consulting
with its Tax Advisors, to structure the settlement or other disposition of any
Claim in a tax-efficient manner that minimizes the Net Tax Cost associated
with the receipt of Claims Proceeds, as applicable and (ii) treat the
payment  of any CVR Payment Amount as not subject to any deduction or
withholding (including by taking such position in any relevant tax
proceeding), unless withholding is otherwise required pursuant to a Final
Determination or a change in applicable  tax law after the date hereof. To
the extent permitted by applicable law, (A) the Company shall, and shall cause
any of its Affiliates to, report, for purposes of any Tax return, the receipt
of Claims Proceeds as a Tax-free adjustment to the  consideration received in
exchange for the Cherokee shares in the First Merger, as applicable, and (B)
the Company shall not take any position inconsistent with the reporting
described in clause (A) of this sentence for any applicable Tax  purposes.

 


 

 

Section 2.03 _Actions_. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Committee may
act only with the concurrence of a majority of the Committee Members;
provided, however, that the Committee may, by resolution adopted by a majority
of the Committee Members, designate a Chairman or other Committee Member to
act as the administrative Committee Member and delegate to the Chairman  or
such other Committee Member such authority as the Committee may determine,
provided further, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,  the
Committee may not take any of the following actions without the prior written
approval of Smokey: (a) the incurrence of any Claims Expenses in excess of the
value of the assets deposited in the Escrow Account; and (b) any action that
would  reasonably be expected to adversely impact the business, financial
condition, operations, reputation or commercial relationships of Cherokee,
Smokey or their respective Affiliates in any material way. For the avoidance
of doubt, nothing in  this _Section 2.03_ prevents the Committee from
determining to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section      8.01_
or taking any other action that it is expressly permitted to take pursuant to
this Agreement.

 


 

 

Section 2.04 _Replacement of Committee Members_.

 


 

 

(a) Each Committee Member may resign at any time by giving  written notice
thereof to the Company specifying a date when such resignation will take
effect, which notice will be sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the date
so specified.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to the Second Merger, Smokey and Cherokee jointly,  and, following
the Second Merger, the Company shall have the right to remove (i) the Initial
Committee Member who was an employee or director of Smokey prior to the Merger
(and his successors) at any time by a board resolution specifying a date 
when such removal will take effect and (ii) any other Initial Committee Member
(and their respective successors) only for Due Cause as determined by majority
vote of the Committee. Notice of such removal will be given by the Company to
the  Committee.

 


 

 

(c) If a Committee Member shall resign, be removed or become  incapable of
acting, prior to the Second Merger, Smokey and Cherokee jointly, and,
following the Second Merger, the Company shall promptly appoint, (i) for any
Committee Member described in _Section 2.04(b)(i)_ , a qualified successor
Committee Member, which may be an officer of the Company or Smokey, and (ii)
for any other Committee Member, a qualified successor Committee Member, which
may be an officer of  director of the Company or Smokey, who has been
selected and approved by a majority of the members of Smokey's board of
directors who were members of Cherokee's board of directors prior to the First
Merger. The successor Committee Member so  appointed shall under the
provisions of this _Section 2.04(c)_ , forthwith upon his or her acceptance of
such appointment in accordance with _Section 2.04(d)_ , become a successor
Committee Member.

 


 

 

 

4  


 

 

(d) Every successor appointed under this _Section 2.04_ shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Company and the Rights Agent an instrument
accepting such appointment and a joinder to this Agreement, and  thereupon
such successor shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and
responsibilities as if it had been originally named as the Committee Member
such successor is succeeding without further act or deed.

 


 

 

Section 2.05 _Liability ; Indemnification_.

 


 

 

(a) Each Committee Member undertakes to perform only such  duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against any Committee Member. No
Committee Member shall be liable, responsible or accountable in damages or 
otherwise for any Loss (including Losses that are costs and expenses of
defense of claims, as incurred) incurred by reason of having been a Committee
Member or resulting from the administration of any Claims or the Escrow
Account, or any  decision, action or failure to act, except to the extent
that any such Loss shall have been caused by the bad faith, gross negligence,
willful misconduct, or fraud of such Committee Member. Each Holder, by virtue
of its acceptance of a CVR,  shall be deemed to have consented and agreed to
release and forever discharge each Committee Member from and against any and
all liabilities, responsibilities and claims for damages or otherwise for any
Loss incurred by reason of having been a  Committee Member or resulting from
administration of any Claims or the Escrow Account or any decision, action or
failure to act, except to the extent that any such Loss shall have been caused
by the bad faith, gross negligence, willful  misconduct, or fraud of such
Committee Member.

 


 

 

(b) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and provide  customary
insurance to, each Committee Member against any Loss incurred by reason of
having been a Committee Member or resulting from the administration of any
Claims or the Escrow Account, or any decision, action or failure to act,
except to  the extent of such Committee Member's fraud, willful misconduct,
bad faith, or gross negligence. The Committee shall advance out of the Escrow
Account payments in connection with the Company's indemnification obligations
under this _Section 2.05(b)_ upon request of any Committee Member and with the
consent of the Company; provided that such Committee Member shall have
delivered to the Company a written undertaking to repay any amount advanced to
the extent that such Loss was the result of the bad faith, gross negligence,
willful misconduct, or  fraud of such Committee Member. The rights of each
Committee Member under this _Section 2.05(b)_ are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to  which such Committee Member may be
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. These rights are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Committee Member. The
obligations of the Company under this _Section 2.05(b)_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Committee Member without the consent of such Committee Member  and shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the removal or resignation of
any Committee Member. For the avoidance of doubt, all Losses indemnified by
the Company pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be treated as Claims
Expenses  reimbursable out of the Escrow Account to the extent paid directly
by the Company (and not covered or otherwise reimbursable to the Company as a
result of any insurance policies it holds or of which it benefits).

 


 

 

 

5  


 

 

ARTICLE III

 

_CERTAIN COVENANTS_

 


 

 

Section 3.01 _Cooperation_.

 


 

 

(a) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to  (i) to the
extent permitted by Law, provide the Committee and its Advisors with access
reasonably necessary to Pursue the Claims, at normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, to Cherokee's books and records (including electronic and 
archived documents and Litigation Materials) and the Company's facilities and
to current employees and Advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including in connection with testimony in litigation and factual
investigation, and (ii)  generally provide support, and make its and its
Subsidiaries' employees and Advisors reasonably available to provide
assistance and expertise at such times and in such places as reasonably
necessary, to Pursue the Claims; provided that, in the case of each of clauses
(i) and (ii), (A) the Company only shall be required to provide such access
and support and make its and its  Subsidiaries' employees and Advisors
available to the extent and in such manner as does not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (B) the
Company may withhold access from the Committee to  the extent that the
Company is aware that (x) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party or another
contract that restricts such access, (y) providing such access would  result
in a loss of attorney-client or other legal privilege, or (z) providing such
access would violate any applicable Law. Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by employees or Advisors of the Company or its Subsidiaries (but in
no  event any compensation expenses of employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries) in connection with the Committee's access to them shall be paid
by the Committee out of the Escrow Account upon submission to the Committee by
such employee or  Advisor or the Company of reasonable documentation
regarding such out-of-pocket expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make any employee or
other person under its control available to  testify at a trial or
evidentiary hearing at the request of the Committee.

 


 

 

(b) The Company shall (i) maintain in place any litigation  document
retention policies that exist as of the Effective Time and (ii) implement and
maintain new litigation document retention policies as are reasonably
necessary to Pursue the Claims; provided that in the case of implementing and
maintaining any such new policies, they shall not unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 


 

 

Section 3.02 _Powers-of-Attorney_. The Company shall execute and deliver to
the Committee a power-of-attorney in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Company and the Committee to enable the Committee to file pleadings and
execute  any documents on behalf of the Company necessary or appropriate to
enable the Committee to prosecute any Claim and to settle or compromise any
Claim Pursued by the Committee in accordance with this Agreement, in each
case, in the name of the  Company.

 


 

 

Section 3.03 _Pursuit of Claims_. The Company and its Affiliates shall not
disclose any non-public information with respect to any Claims to any third
parties except (a) to the Committee and its Advisors, (b) to Advisors of the 
Company and its Affiliates who are advised or are aware of the confidential
nature of such information and the restrictions set forth in this _Section
3.03_ in respect  of such non-public information, (c) to the extent such
disclosure is required by, or pursuant to an agreement with, any Governmental
Authority or applicable Law or (d) to the extent such information previously
has become part of the public  domain without breach of this _Section 3.03_
by the Company or any of its Affiliates.

 


 

 

Section 3.04 _Settlements_. No settlement or compromise of any Claim Pursued
by the Committee shall require any consent or action by Cherokee, Smokey or
their respective Affiliates, unless such settlement or compromise would (a) 
require the payment by the Company or any of its Affiliates of any amount in
cash in excess of the remaining amount in the Escrow Account (provided that 
in the event a settlement requires cash payments by the Company and there are
sufficient funds in the Escrow Account, such amounts shall promptly be paid to
the Company from the Escrow Account), (b) create a material ongoing obligation
of  Cherokee, Smokey or their respective Affiliates (other than execution of
a customary release), (c) include an adverse admission of fact regarding the
Company or its Affiliates, or (d) include a term that, in the Company's
reasonable judgment,  would have an adverse impact on the Company's business.

 


 

 

 

6  


 

 

Section 3.05 _Information_.

 


 

 

(a) Until all of the Claims have been completed, cancelled,  settled or are
final and not subject to further judicial review (by appeal or otherwise), the
Company shall receive, by the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter of the
Company (unless significant activity, in the reasonable judgment of the 
Committee, occurs during such quarter, in which case monthly reports shall be
provided during such time), a report from the Committee reasonably describing
the status of the Claims, which report shall describe, in summary fashion,
without  limitation, the total Claims Expenses incurred through the date of
such report, the status of all pending court proceedings related to the
Claims, whether any new claims or proceedings have been brought by Committee
related to the Claims, and  the status of any counterclaims brought by the
defendants related to the Claims, and the status of any settlement
negotiations among the Committee and the defendants with respect to the
Claims, to the extent then known.

 


 

 

(b) The Company shall reasonably promptly notify the Committee  of any
information, documentation, or updates (unless immaterial) that it and/or its
Affiliates receives or is made aware of in respect of the Claims; provided 
that the Committee has not also received, or been made aware of, such
information, documentation or updates.

 


 

 

(c) The Committee shall promptly provide the Company with  information to the
extent reasonably requested in connection with reports, forms, notifications,
applications, Tax returns and other documents to be filed with the Internal
Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority in order to comply  with
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any state,
local or foreign Tax law, or applicable federal or state  securities laws.

 


 

 

(d) The Committee shall promptly notify the Company of any  material change
in the Pursuit of Claims, to the extent then known.

 


 

 

Section 3.06 _Claims Expenses_. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to
the contrary, the Company shall not be required to incur any fees, costs, or
expenses in Pursuit of the Claims to the extent such fees, costs, or 
expenses can be incurred by the Committee and paid out of the Escrow Account
pursuant to the authority granted to the Committee hereunder.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) except for the
contribution of the Initial Escrow Amount pursuant to _Section 4.01(b)_ , and

(b) All Earnings shall be paid into a sub-account of the  Escrow Account (the
"Earnings Account") and the Rights Agent shall reinvest such Earnings in the
same manner as the Escrow Assets are  directed to be invested by the

(c) If at any time the Committee deems it necessary that some  or all of the
investments constituting Escrow Assets or Earnings be redeemed or sold in

Agreement, the Committee shall direct the Rights Agent to effect such 
redemption or sale, in such manner and at such time as the Committee directs.

 


 

 

Section 4.03 _Claims Expenses_. All Claims Expenses, any payments due to the
Company with respect to the Net Tax Cost arising from the receipt of the

(b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days  following the
Preliminary Determination Date, the Committee shall prepare a certificate (the
"Claims Proceeds Certificate") setting  forth in reasonable detail (i) the
amount of any Claims Proceeds received by the Committee, the Company or its
Affiliates, if any, (ii) an itemized list in reasonable detail of the Claims
Expenses, (iii) a calculation of the Net Tax Cost, (iv)  a calculation of the
CVR Payment Amount, and (v) any assumptions underlying the determination of
any item used in making the necessary calculations for such calculations. The
date on which the amount of the CVR Payment Amount and Claims  Expenses are
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 5.01_ is referred to as the
"Determination Date".

 


 

 

Section 5.02 _Payments_.

 


 

 

(a) The determination by the Company and the Committee of the  CVR Payment
Amount pursuant to _Section 5.01_ , absent a mathematical error, shall be
final and binding on the Company and each Holder.

 


 

 

(b) Except in the specific cases specified in this Agreement,  no interest
shall accrue on any amounts payable on the CVRs to any Holder.

 


 

 

(c) No later than thirty (30) days after the Determination  Date (and prior
to the payments pursuant to _Section 5.02(d)_ ), the Committee shall cause to
be paid from the Escrow Account all Claims Expenses as determined pursuant 
to _Section 5.01(a)_.

 


 

 

(d) No later than (60) days after the Determination Date, (i)  the Committee
shall cause to be withdrawn from the Escrow Account and paid to the Company
the Net Tax Cost (which amount shall thereafter be the property of the
Company), and (ii) the Committee shall cause the Rights Agent to pay the Net
Claims  Proceeds to the CVR Holders (the date of such payment to the CVR
Holders, the "CVR Payment Date"). The Rights Agent shall pay the  applicable
CVR Payment Amount to each Holder by check mailed to the address of such
Holder as reflected on the CVR Register as of the close of business on the
last Business Day prior to such CVR Payment Date; provided that,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall any CVR
Holder have any right to any assets of Cherokee, Smokey or any of their
respective  Affiliates other than the Escrow Assets. Any Escrow Assets that
remain undistributed to the CVR Holders nine (9) months after the CVR Payment
Date shall be delivered to the Company, and upon demand, any CVR Holders who
have not theretofore  received cash in exchange for such CVRs shall
thereafter look only to the Company for payment of their claim therefor.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any Escrow Assets that
remain unclaimed immediately prior to such  time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Company
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person  previously entitled
thereto.

 


 

 

(e) The Rights Agent shall deduct and withhold, or cause to be  deducted or
withheld, from any amount payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law;
provided, however, that the Rights Agent shall not be permitted to deduct or
withhold with respect to the payment of any CVR Payment Amount (and no
amount  shall be included in the definition of Claims Expenses in respect of
any deduction or withholding Tax) unless otherwise required pursuant to (i) a
Final Determination or (ii) a change in applicable Tax law after the date
hereof. To the extent  that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority in each case in compliance
with the preceding sentence, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been  paid to the Company or the Holder
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent any
amounts are deducted or withheld not in compliance with this
_Section       5.02(e)_ (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
exclude any deduction or withholding required pursuant to a Final
Determination or a change in applicable Tax law after the date hereof) the sum
payable to the Person with respect  to whom such deduction or withholding was
made shall be increased as necessary so that after any such deductions or
withholding (including any deductions or withholding applicable to such
additional sums payable) such person receives an amount  equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions or withholding been made.

(D) as may be necessary or appropriate to  ensure that the CVRs are not
subject to registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder; provided that, in each case, the amendment does not
adversely affect the rights of the Holders; or

 


 

 

(E) for the purpose of otherwise adding,  eliminating or changing any
provisions of this Agreement, unless such addition, elimination or change is
adverse to the rights of the Holders.

 


 

 

(b) Prior to the Second Merger, Acting Holders, Cherokee,  Smokey, and the
Committee, and, following the Second Merger, Acting Holders, the Company and

under this _Section 6.01(b)_   to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such written consent shall approve
the substance thereof.

 


 

 

(c) Promptly after the execution of any amendment pursuant to  the provisions
of this _Section 6.01_ , the Company and the Committee shall deliver to the
Rights Agent a notice thereof setting forth in general terms the substance

(d) Upon the execution of any amendment in accordance with  this _Section
6.01_ , this Agreement shall be modified in accordance therewith, such
amendment shall form a part of this Agreement for all purposes and every
Holder  shall be bound thereby.

 


 

 

(e) The Rights Agent shall be entitled to receive and shall be  fully
protected in relying upon an officers' certificate and opinion of counsel as
conclusive evidence that any such amendment or supplement is authorized or
permitted hereunder, that it is not inconsistent herewith and that it will be
valid  and binding upon the Company and the Committee in accordance with its
terms. The costs of any such opinion of counsel shall be paid by the Committee
out of the Escrow Account.

 


 

 

Section 6.02 _Company May Consolidate, etc_. After the Second Step Effective
Time, the Company shall not consolidate with or merge into any other Person or

succeed to, be substituted for and assume all covenants and obligations of,
and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Agreement 
with the same effect as if the Surviving Person had been named as the Company
herein, and thereafter the predecessor Person shall be relieved of all
covenants and obligations under this Agreement and the CVRs. The provisions of
this _Section 6.02_ shall apply to successive transactions and shall apply
jointly and severally to all Surviving Persons should any transaction result
in multiple Surviving  Persons.

_RIGHTS AGENT_

 


 

 

Section 7.01 _Appointment of Rights Agent_. The Company and the Committee
hereby appoint [●] as the rights agent to act in accordance with the
instructions set forth in this Agreement, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts
such  appointment.

 


 

 

Section 7.02 _Certain Rights of the Rights Agent_.

 


 

 

(a) The Rights Agent may consult at any time with legal  counsel satisfactory
to it, and the Rights Agent shall incur no liability or responsibility to the
Company or to the Committee in respect of any action taken or not taken in
connection with this Agreement, except to the extent of its gross 
negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, or fraud.

 


 

 

(b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this  Agreement the
Rights Agent shall reasonably deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or
matter be proved or established by the Company or the Committee prior to
taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless such 
evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed
to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate signed by (i) the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the
President, the Chief  Financial Officer, the Treasurer or the Secretary of
the Company, or (ii) a majority of the Committee Members, in the case of the
Committee, and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be
full authorization to the Rights Agent  for any action taken or suffered in
good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement in reliance upon such
certificate.

 


 

 

(c) The Committee shall (i) pay the Rights Agent out of the  Escrow Account
compensation for all services rendered by the Rights Agent as set forth in
Exhibit II, and (ii) reimburse the Rights  Agent out of the Escrow Account
for all reasonable and documented expenses, Taxes (other than income Taxes)
and governmental charges and other reasonable and documented charges of any

Agent) in the performance of its duties under this Agreement. The Company
shall indemnify the Rights Agent for, and hold the Rights Agent harmless
against,  any loss, liability, claim, demands, suits or expense to the extent

extent paid directly by the Company.

 


 

 

 

11  


 

 

(d) The Rights Agent will not incur any liability or  responsibility to the
Committee or the Company for any action taken in reliance on any resolution,
certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
direction, consent, order or other paper or document reasonably and in good 
faith believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper party or parties.

 


 

 

Section 7.03 _Designation ; Removal; Successor Rights Agent_.

duties under this Agreement by giving written notice thereof to the Company
and the Committee specifying a date when such resignation will take effect,
which notice will be sent at least sixty (60) days prior to the date so
specified  but in no event will such resignation become effective until a
successor Rights Agent has been appointed. Prior to the Second Merger,
Cherokee, Smokey, and the Committee, and, following the Second Merger, the
Company and the Committee, in each  case acting jointly, have the right to
remove the Rights Agent at any time by specifying a date when such removal
will take effect but no such removal will become effective until a successor
Rights Agent has been appointed. Notice of such  removal will be given by the
Committee to the Rights Agent, which notice will be sent at least sixty (60)
days prior to the date so specified.

 


 

 

(b) If the Rights Agent shall resign, is removed pursuant to _Section 7.03(a)_
or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, (i) prior to the Second Merger,
Cherokee, Smokey, and the Committee, and (ii) following the Second Merger, 
the Company and the Committee shall, in each case, jointly appoint a successor
to the Rights Agent. If the Company and the Committee shall fail to make such
appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after the Company
and the  Committee have been notified in writing of such resignation or
incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent or by any Holder
(whose name shall appear on the CVR Register), then any Holder may apply to
any court of competent  jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor to
the Rights Agent. Any successor Rights Agent shall be a stock transfer agent
of national reputation or the corporate trust department of a commercial bank.

 


 

 

(c) After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be  vested with the
same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally
named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the former Rights Agent
shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property  at the
time held by it hereunder (including the Escrow Assets, all records of Claims
Expense disbursements, the CVR Register and all computer files and other
information related to the foregoing), and execute and deliver any further
assurance,  conveyance, act or deed necessary for such purpose.

 


 

 

(d) In the event of such resignation or removal, the successor  Rights Agent
shall mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each Holder, written
notice of such removal or resignation and the name and address of such
successor Rights Agent. The costs of any such mailing shall be paid by the
Committee  out of the Escrow Account.

Section 8.04 _Notice to Holders_. Where this Agreement provides for notice to
Holders, such notice will be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid,
to  each Holder affected by such event, at the Holder's address as it appears
in the CVR Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, if any, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case
where notice  to Holders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such
notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder will
affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders.

 


 

 

Section 8.05 _Assignment_. Following the Second Merger, the Company may assign
any or all of its rights, interests and obligations hereunder to any other
Person (an "Assignee") in its sole discretion and without the consent of any
other party; provided that the Assignee  assumes the performance of the
Company's obligations under this Agreement by written agreement or operation
of law. Any Assignee may thereafter assign any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder in the same manner as the  Company pursuant to the
prior sentence. The Rights Agent may not assign this Agreement without
Cherokee and Smokey's consent prior to the Second Merger and without the
Company's written consent following the Second Merger. Any attempted 
assignment of this Agreement or any such rights in violation of this _Section
8.05_ shall be void and of no effect.

Section 8.06 _Interpretation_.

 


 

 

(a) _Time Periods_. When calculating the period of time before which, within
which or after which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, (i) the date that is the reference date in calculating such 
period shall be excluded and (ii) if the last day of such period is not a
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day. All references in this Agreement to a number of days are to such number
of calendar  days unless Business Days are specified.

 


 

 

(b) _Dollars_. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, any reference in this
Agreement to $ means U.S. dollars.

 


 

 

(c) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

 


 

 

(d) _Sections and Headings_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings in this Agreement 
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 


 

 

(e) _Include_. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation."

 


 

 

(f) _Hereof_. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this  Agreement.

 


 

 

(g) _Extent_. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if."

 


 

 

(h) _Persons_. References to a person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns.

 


 

 

Section 8.07 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall 
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party or such party waives its rights
under this  _Section 8.07_ with respect thereto. Upon any determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties to this  Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to  the extent possible.

 


 

 

Section 8.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one (1) or more
counterparts (including by means of email in .pdf format), all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective  when
one (1) or more counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to
the other parties.

 


 

 

Section 8.09 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, will give to any Person (other than the Rights Agent, Smokey,
Smokey's successors, the Company, the Company's successors, the Committee 
Members, Assignees, the Holders and the Holders' successors and assigns
pursuant to a Permitted Transfer) any benefit or any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under this Agreement or under any covenant or provision herein
contained, all  such covenants and provisions being for the sole benefit of
the foregoing. The rights of Holders and their successors and assigns pursuant
to Permitted Transfers are limited to those expressly provided in this
Agreement.

Section 8.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State
of Tennessee, without regard to conflict of laws principles.

IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS A PART OF OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH
CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING SHALL  BE HEARD AND DETERMINED BY THE
CHOSEN COURTS. THE PARTIES HEREBY GRANT THE CHOSEN COURTS JURISDICTION OVER
THE PERSONS OF THE PARTIES AND, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OVER THE
SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING.

 


 

 

Section 8.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY,
INTENTIONALLY, AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE

UNDER, ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
