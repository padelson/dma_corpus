TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

This Transaction Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated July 8, 2015, is among
The Procter and Gamble Company, an Ohio corporation ("Parent"), Galleria Co., a
Delaware corporation ("SplitCo"), Coty Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Acquiror") and Green Acquisition Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror ("Merger Sub").

RECITALS

1. Parent is engaged, directly and indirectly through certain of its Subsidiaries, in the Galleria Business.

2. Parent has determined that it would be appropriate and desirable to separate the Galleria Business from Parent and to divest the Galleria Business in the manner contemplated hereby.

3. Parent has caused SplitCo to be formed in order to facilitate such separation and divestiture.

4. Parent currently owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of SplitCo (the "SplitCo Common Stock").

5. Parent has determined that, subject to the terms and conditions herein, it would be appropriate and desirable for Parent and certain of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Convey to SplitCo or the Galleria Entities, as applicable, certain Assets of the Galleria Business in exchange for (i) the assumption by SplitCo or the other members of the Galleria Group, as applicable, of certain Liabilities of the Galleria Business and (ii) Parent's receipt of shares of SplitCo Common Stock and the Recapitalization Amount, all as provided herein.

6. The Parties contemplate that the Galleria Business will be transferred to SplitCo as provided herein, and in connection therewith the Recapitalization will take place, including SplitCo's entry into the Galleria Credit Facility and SplitCo's payment of the Recapitalization Amount.

7. The Parties contemplate that, immediately following the Galleria Transfer and Recapitalization, Parent will either (i) distribute all of the shares of SplitCo Common Stock to Parent shareholders without consideration on a pro rata basis (a "One-Step Spin-Off") or (ii) consummate an offer to exchange (an "Exchange Offer") shares of SplitCo Common Stock for currently outstanding shares of Parent's common stock ("Parent Common Stock") and, in the event that Parent's shareholders subscribe for less than all of the SplitCo Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent will distribute, pro rata to its shareholders, any unsubscribed SplitCo Common Stock on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer so that Parent may be treated for U.S. federal income Tax purposes as having distributed all of the SplitCo Common Stock to its shareholders (the "Clean-Up Spin-Off").

8. The disposition by Parent of 100% of the SplitCo Common Stock, whether by way of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer (followed by any Clean-Up Spin-Off) is referred to herein as the "Distribution".

9. Immediately after the Distribution, Merger Sub, a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, will merge with and into SplitCo and SplitCo Common Stock will be converted into shares of Class A Common Stock ("Acquiror New Common Stock") on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

10. The Boards of Directors of Parent, SplitCo, Acquiror and Merger Sub have each approved and declared advisable the Merger of Merger Sub with and into SplitCo.

11. No later than 24 hours following execution of this Agreement, it is anticipated that the holders of shares of common stock of Acquiror representing at least a majority of the voting power of Acquiror will execute and deliver to Acquiror a written consent, in accordance with and pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL, approving (i) the issuance of shares of Acquiror New Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, (ii) increasing the number of authorized shares of capital stock of Acquiror and (iii) amending the Acquiror's certificate of incorporation. Contemporaneously with the execution hereof, JAB Cosmetics B.V., as the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock, is entering into a letter agreement with Parent regarding the conversion of all such shares into shares of Class A Common Stock as of two Business Days prior to the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in such letter agreement (the "JAB Letter Agreement").

12. It is intended that (i) the Galleria Transfer, together with the Distribution, qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) the Distribution, as such, qualify as a distribution of SplitCo Common Stock to Parent's shareholders pursuant to Section 355 of the Code, (iii) the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a) of the Code, (iv) any Parent Cash Distribution qualify as money distributed to Parent creditors in connection with the reorganization for purposes of Section 361(b)(3) of the Code, and (v) the execution of this Agreement constitute a plan of reorganization under Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

13. Pursuant to the plan of reorganization and within one year after the Distribution Date, Parent will effect any Parent Cash Distribution to Parent's creditors in retirement of outstanding Parent Indebtedness in the manner described in this Agreement.

14. Simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and Acquiror are entering into the Split Plan Agreement.

Accordingly, the Parties agree as follows:

I.GALLERIA TRANSFER AND RESTRUCTURING; 
RECAPITALIZATION OF SPLITCO

1.01 Transfer and Restructuring. (a) Overview. Prior to consummating the
Distribution and Merger as contemplated in Article II, Parent and SplitCo will
effect a reorganization of the Galleria Business. This reorganization will
include the Galleria Transfer and a restructuring of the Galleria Business as
contemplated by Section 5.21 (the Galleria Transfer, together with the
activities set forth in Sections 5.21, 6.02 and 6.03, collectively, the
"Restructuring").

(b) SplitCo. SplitCo was formed as a Delaware corporation and will hold and
conduct, directly and indirectly through its Subsidiaries, the Galleria
Business. Parent will not cause or permit SplitCo to engage in any activity
not contemplated by this Agreement, and prior to the Closing SplitCo will not
operate any business other than the Galleria Business. In connection with the
Restructuring, SplitCo and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries will become the
owner of the Galleria Assets and will assume the Galleria Liabilities.

(c) Business Transfer Time. Subject to the satisfaction and waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, the effective time and date of each
Conveyance and assumption of any Asset or Liability in accordance with this
Article I in connection with the Galleria Transfer will be 12:01 a.m., Eastern
Time, on the anticipated Closing Date (such time, the "Business Transfer
Time," and such date the "Business Transfer Date").

1.02 Transfer of Assets. Except as provided in Section 1.08, effective as of
the Business Transfer Time, Parent will assign, transfer, convey and deliver
("Convey") (or will cause any applicable Subsidiary of Parent to Convey) to
SplitCo and/or its Subsidiaries, and SplitCo will accept from Parent and will
cause its applicable Subsidiaries to accept, all of Parent's and its
applicable Subsidiaries' respective right, title and interest in and to all
Galleria Assets (other than any Galleria Assets that are already held as of
the Business Transfer Time by SplitCo or one of its Subsidiaries, which
Galleria Asset will continue to be held by SplitCo or such Subsidiary), free
and clear of all Securities Interests (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

1.03 Assumption of Liabilities. Effective as of the Business Transfer Time,
Parent will Convey (or will cause any applicable Subsidiary of Parent to
Convey) to SplitCo, and SplitCo will assume, perform and fulfill when due and,
to the extent applicable, comply with, or will cause any applicable Subsidiary
to assume, perform and fulfill when due and, to the extent applicable, comply
with, all of the Galleria Liabilities, in accordance with their respective
terms (other than any Galleria Liability that as of the Business Transfer Time
is already a Liability of SplitCo or one of its Subsidiaries, which Galleria
Liability will continue to be a Liability of SplitCo or such Subsidiary). As
between members of the Parent Group, on the one hand, and members of the
Galleria Group, on the other hand, the members of the Galleria Group will be
solely responsible for all Galleria Liabilities as of the Business Transfer
Time, on a joint and several basis.

1.04 Transfer of Excluded Assets; Excluded Liabilities. Except as provided in
Section 1.08, prior to the Business Transfer Time, (a) Parent will cause any
applicable Galleria Entity to Convey to Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent any
Excluded Assets that it owns, leases or has any right to use, and Parent will
accept from such member of the Galleria Group, and will cause an applicable
Subsidiary of Parent (other than a Galleria Entity) to accept, all such
respective right, title and interest in and to any and all of such Excluded
Assets and (b) Parent will cause any applicable Galleria Entity to Convey any
Excluded Liability for which it is otherwise responsible to Parent or a
Subsidiary of Parent (other than a Galleria Entity), and Parent will assume,
perform and fulfill when due, and to the extent applicable, comply with, or
will cause the applicable Subsidiary of Parent to assume, perform and fulfill
when due and, to the extent applicable, comply with, all of such Excluded
Liabilities in accordance with their respective terms.

1.08 Transfers In Violation of Law or Required Consents. (a) Except as
otherwise provided in Section 1.09, if and to the extent that the consummation
of the Galleria Transfer or Conveyance of Excluded Assets would be a violation
of applicable Laws or require any Consent in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby that has not been obtained as of the Business Transfer
Time, then, notwithstanding any other provision hereof, such Conveyance of the
applicable Galleria Asset or Excluded Asset will automatically be deferred and
will not occur until all legal impediments are removed or such Consents have
been obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Asset will still be
considered a Galleria Asset or Excluded Asset, as applicable, and the Person
retaining such Asset will thereafter hold such Asset in trust for the benefit,
insofar as reasonably possible, of the Person entitled thereto (and at such
Person's sole expense) until the consummation of the Conveyance thereof. The
Parties will use their respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i)
continue to seek to remove any legal impediments or secure any contractual
Consents required from third parties necessary to Convey such Asset and (ii)
develop and implement arrangements to place the Person entitled to receive
such Asset, insofar as reasonably possible and to the extent not prohibited by
applicable Law or the relevant Contract, in the same position as if such Asset
had been Conveyed as contemplated hereby such that all the benefits and
burdens relating to such Asset, including possession, use, risk of loss,
potential for gain, any Tax Liabilities in respect thereof and dominion,
control and command over such Asset, are to inure from and after the Business
Transfer Time to such Person. If and when the applicable legal or contractual
impediments are removed or the applicable Consents are obtained, the
Conveyance of the applicable Asset will be effected in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or such applicable Ancillary Agreement. The
obligations set forth in this Section 1.08 will terminate on the two-year
anniversary of the Closing. Nothing in this Section 1.08(a) will be deemed to
(A) constitute or require a waiver by any of the Parties of any of the closing
conditions set forth in Article VII, including the receipt of the Governmental
Approvals or (B) apply to any Shared Business Contract, it being understood
that Shared Business Contracts are governed by Section 1.08(b).

(b) Shared Business Contracts. (c) Parent will use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to deliver a true, correct and complete list of its Shared Business
Contracts existing as of the date of this Agreement no later than 90 days
after the date hereof (except in connection with any Contract the existence or
terms of which are confidential) that are not set forth on Section 3.08(b) of
the Parent Disclosure Letter. With respect to purchases of raw materials and
packaging materials that are not covered or governed by a Contract other than
a purchase order or other similar arrangement, Parent may satisfy this
obligation by identifying the relevant raw material or packaging material and
providing a reasonably detailed description of the arrangement utilized to
purchase such material.

(i) Parent shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause each Shared
Business Contract to be assigned in relevant part to a Galleria Entity on or
prior to the Business Transfer Time or to appropriately amend such Shared
Business Contract to the extent permitted by applicable Law or the relevant
Shared Business Contract so that Acquiror or its Affiliates will, at and
following the Closing, be entitled to the rights and benefits inuring to the
Galleria Business under such Shared Business Contracts, and any such amended
Shared Business Contract will be treated by the Parties as a separate Contract
for all purposes. In addition, Parent will provide Acquiror with contact
information for such third parties and introduce representatives of the
Acquiror Group to Parent's contacts at such third parties.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 1.08 to the contrary, no member
of the Parent Group nor any of its Affiliates will be required to undertake
any action or arrangement contemplated by this Section 1.08 (i) if Parent
determines, in its sole discretion, that such arrangement or action would
materially increase the likelihood that the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would
not apply to the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) if such arrangement
is not in compliance with applicable Law (or the relevant Shared Business
Contract).

1.09 Retained Elements of Mercury Business. The Parent and Acquiror will
implement the provisions set forth on Schedule 1.09.

to evidence the Conveyance of all of SplitCo's and its Subsidiaries' right,
title and interest in and to the Excluded Assets to Parent and the other

Conveyance will require SplitCo or any of its Affiliates to make any
additional representations, warranties or covenants, expressed or implied, not
contained in this Agreement except to the extent required to comply with

supplemental agreements or arrangements as are effective to preserve the

Liabilities and other instruments of assumption (in each case in a form that

(a) General. At the Business Transfer Time, in partial consideration for the
Conveyance of Assets contemplated by Section 1.02, SplitCo will:

(v) issue and deliver to Parent a number of shares of SplitCo Common Stock
equal to (1) the Galleria Stock Amount, less (2) the number of shares of
SplitCo Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the issuance of SplitCo
Common Stock pursuant to this Section 1.13 (the "Galleria Stock Issuance");

(vi) subject to Section 1.13(c), distribute to Parent any remaining portion of
the Recapitalization Amount not previously distributed to Parent pursuant to
Section 1.13(c) in cash in immediately available funds to an account specified
for this purpose by Parent; and

(vii) assume the Galleria Liabilities in accordance with the requirements of
this Agreement.

(b) Credit Facility. At the Business Transfer Time, or within seven days prior

with total available credit in the principal amount of $4,500,000,000 (subject

(c) Cash Distribution. At the Business Transfer Time, or within seven days
prior to the Business Transfer Time, SplitCo will (i) borrow funds under the
Galleria Credit Facility in an amount equal to the Recapitalization Amount,
(ii) in its discretion, subject to Section 5.21(g), use all or a portion of

Pursuant to the plan of reorganization and as soon as practicable following
the Distribution Date, Parent will distribute any funds received from SplitCo
pursuant to this Section 1.13(c), and all remaining amounts in the above-
described segregated account, to Parent's creditors in retirement of
outstanding Parent indebtedness (any such distribution, the "Parent Cash
Distribution"). Prior to effecting any Parent Cash Distribution, Parent will
adopt a corporate resolution specifying that such distribution will be made
from the funds maintained in the segregated account referenced in this Section
1.13(c).

1.14 Waiver of Bulk-Sales Laws. Each of Parent and SplitCo hereby waives
compliance by each member of their respective Group with the requirements and
provisions of the "bulk-sale" or "bulk-transfer" Laws of any jurisdiction that
may otherwise be applicable with respect to the Conveyance of any or all of
the Assets to any member of the Parent Group or Galleria Group, as applicable.

II. THE DISTRIBUTION AND MERGER

2.01 Form and Manner of Distribution. (a) Parent may elect, in its sole
discretion, to effect the Distribution in the form of either (i) so long as
Parent reasonably believes the condition set forth in Section 7.03(d) would be
capable of being satisfied, a One-Step Spin-Off or (ii) an Exchange Offer
(including any Clean-Up Spin-Off, as set forth below).

(b) If Parent elects to effect the Distribution in the form of a One-Step
Spin-Off, the Board of Directors of Parent, in accordance with applicable Law,
will establish (or designate Persons to establish) a Record Date and the
Distribution Date. All shares of SplitCo Common Stock held by Parent on the
Distribution Date will be distributed to the Record Holders in the manner
determined by Parent and in accordance with Section 2.02(e).

(c) If Parent elects to effect the Distribution as an Exchange Offer, Parent
will determine in its sole discretion the terms and conditions of such
Exchange Offer, including the number of shares of SplitCo Common Stock that
will be offered for each validly tendered share of Parent Common Stock, the
period during which such Exchange Offer will remain open, the procedures for
the tender and exchange of shares and all other terms and conditions of such
Exchange Offer, which will comply with securities Law requirements applicable
to such Exchange Offer; provided, that in any event, Parent shall extend the
expiration date of such Exchange Offer for one or more consecutive increments
of not more than 20 Business Days each (the length of such period to be
determined by Parent in consultation with Acquiror), if, as of any otherwise
scheduled expiration of the Exchange Offer, any condition to the Exchange
Offer or the closing of the Merger, other than those conditions that are to be
satisfied on the date the expiration of the Exchange Offer or the closing of
the Merger, has not been satisfied or waived (to the extent permitted under
applicable Laws), it being understood that no such extension shall extend the
expiration date of such Exchange Offer to a time later than, the earlier of
(1) the date that is 60 Business Days after the satisfaction of all conditions
to such Exchange Offer and the closing of the Merger, other than the Minimum
Condition and those conditions that are to be satisfied on the date of
expiration of the Exchange Offer or the closing of the Merger, (2) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (3) the End
Date. In the event that Parent's shareholders subscribe for less than all of
the SplitCo Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including the satisfaction of the Minimum
Condition), Parent will consummate the Clean-Up Spin-Off on the Distribution
Date immediately following the consummation of the Exchange Offer.

2.02 The Distribution. (a) To the extent the Distribution is effected as a
One-Step Spin-Off, subject to the terms thereof, in accordance with Section
2.02(e), each Record Holder will be entitled to receive for each share of
Parent Common Stock held by such Record Holder a number of shares of SplitCo
Common Stock equal to the total number of shares of SplitCo Common Stock held
by Parent on the Distribution Date, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of shares of Parent Common Stock held by such Record
Holder and the denominator of which is the total amount of Parent Common Stock
outstanding on the Distribution Date.

(b) Subject to the terms thereof, to the extent the Distribution is effected
as an Exchange Offer, each Parent shareholder may elect in the Exchange Offer
to exchange a number of shares of Parent Common Stock held by such Parent
shareholder for shares of SplitCo Common Stock subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the SplitCo Form 10/S-4.

(c) Parent and SplitCo, as the case may be, will instruct the transfer agent
or the Exchange Agent in the Distribution, as applicable, to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise required to be distributed pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
from such consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Tax Law. Any withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been distributed to the Persons otherwise entitled
thereto.

(d) The terms and conditions of any Clean-Up Spin-Off will be as determined by
Parent in its sole discretion, provided that, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, (i) any SplitCo Common Stock that is not
subscribed for in the Exchange Offer must be distributed to the Parent's
shareholders in the Clean-Up Spin-Off, and (ii) such Clean-Up Spin-Off must
take place on the Distribution Date immediately following the consummation of
the Exchange Offer so that Parent may be treated for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes as having distributed all of the SplitCo Common Stock to Parent's
shareholders.

(e) Upon the consummation of the One-Step Spin-Off or the Exchange Offer,
Parent will deliver to the Exchange Agent a global certificate representing
the SplitCo Common Stock distributed in the One-Step Spin-Off or exchanged in
the Exchange Offer, as the case may be, for the account of the Parent
shareholders that are entitled thereto. Upon a Clean-Up Spin-Off, if any,
Parent will deliver to the Exchange Agent an additional global certificate
representing the SplitCo Common Stock distributed in the Clean-Up Spin-Off for
the account of the Parent shareholders that are entitled thereto. The Exchange
Agent will hold such certificate or certificates, as the case may be, for the
account of the Parent shareholders pending the Merger.

2.03 Plan of Reorganization. This Agreement will constitute a "plan of
reorganization" for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Pursuant to the plan of
reorganization, (a) Parent will complete the Distribution through either (i) a
One-Step Spin-Off or (ii) the Exchange Offer and, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, any Clean-Up Spin-Off (as described above) and
(b) immediately following the Distribution, Merger Sub will merge with and
into SplitCo with SplitCo surviving.

2.04 The Merger. (c) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged (the "Merger") with and into SplitCo in
accordance with the provisions of the DGCL. Immediately following the Merger,
SplitCo will continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation") and will be a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Acquiror, and
the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease.

(d) The Merger will be consummated by the filing of a certificate of merger
(the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and as is agreed
to by Parent and Acquiror, the "Effective Time").

(e) The Merger will have the effects set forth in this Agreement and, to the
extent not otherwise addressed herein, the applicable provisions of the DGCL.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises of SplitCo and Merger Sub will vest in SplitCo as the Surviving
Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of SplitCo (including all of
the obligations under the Galleria Credit Facility) and Merger Sub will become
the debts, liabilities and duties of SplitCo as the Surviving Corporation.

(f) The text of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
in effect at the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and
restated so as to be identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name
of the corporation set forth in the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation will continue to be "Galleria Co."), until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

(g) The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time
will be the directors of Merger Sub. The initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time will be the officers of SplitCo at the
Effective Time (after taking into account the resignations contemplated by
Section 1.12(a)(iii)). Each of such initial officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation will hold office from the Effective Time until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the
manner provided by the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation or as otherwise provided by Law.

2.05 Amendment of Acquiror's Certificate. Acquiror will present to its
stockholders for approval by written consent in lieu of a meeting, as part of
the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, a proposal to amend, effective as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror's Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation ("Acquiror Certificate"), in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A, to provide for the issuance of Acquiror New Common Stock
and the increase in the number of total authorized shares of capital stock of
Acquiror, and, to the extent the Acquiror Stockholder Approval is so obtained,
such certificate of incorporation will be the certificate of incorporation of
Acquiror from and after the Effective Time until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

2.06 Closing of the Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at Jones Day, 222 East 41st Street, New York, New York, at 10:00
a.m., local time, on the last Business Day of the calendar month in which the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature or pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement are to be satisfied at or immediately prior to the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, the waiver of those
conditions), it being understood that the Parties will work together in good
faith to seek to cause such conditions to be satisfied, and for the Closing to
occur, prior to July 31, 2016. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to as the "Closing Date." For accounting purposes, the Closing will
be deemed to have occurred as of 11:59:59 pm local time on the Closing Date.

2.07 Conversion of Capital Stock in the Merger. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of SplitCo, Acquiror
or the holders of the following securities:

(e) Each share of Merger Sub Common Stock will be converted into and become
one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(f) Subject to Section 2.11 in respect of fractional shares, each issued share
of SplitCo Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive one fully
paid and nonassessable share of Acquiror New Common Stock (such one for one
exchange ratio, the "Exchange Ratio"). The shares of Acquiror New Common Stock
to be issued upon the conversion of shares of SplitCo Common Stock pursuant to
this Section 2.07 and cash in lieu of fractional shares as contemplated by
Section 2.11 are referred to collectively as "Merger Consideration." As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of SplitCo Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to
exist, and any holder of a certificate representing any such shares of SplitCo
Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate,
without interest. The issuance of Acquiror New Common Stock in connection with
the Merger is referred to as the "Acquiror Stock Issuance."

2.08 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Pursuant to Section 2.02(e), the Exchange
Agent will hold, for the account of the relevant Parent shareholders, the
global certificate(s) representing all of the outstanding shares of SplitCo
Common Stock distributed in the Distribution. Such shares of SplitCo Common
Stock will be converted into shares of Acquiror New Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Article II.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent will appoint a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to Acquiror as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent").
Prior to or at the Effective Time, or as reasonably requested by Parent,
Acquiror will deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders
of shares of SplitCo Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Article II through the Exchange Agent, evidence in book entry form
representing the shares of Acquiror New Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Article II in exchange for outstanding shares of SplitCo Common Stock (such
shares of Acquiror New Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund"). For the purposes of such deposit, Acquiror will assume that
there will not be any fractional shares of Acquiror New Common Stock. Acquiror
will make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund,
from time to time as needed or as reasonably requested by Parent, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.11. The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver
the Acquiror New Common Stock to be issued pursuant to this Article II out of
the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.

2.09 Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time of the Merger, and to the extent not previously distributed in
connection with the Distribution, the Exchange Agent will mail to any holder
of record of outstanding shares of SplitCo Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.07 (a) a letter of transmittal and (b) instructions for use in
effecting the exchange of any shares of SplitCo Common Stock for Merger
Consideration. Upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of the letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such SplitCo Common Stock will
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration (together
with cash in lieu of fractional shares) that such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the respective
SplitCo Common Stock will forthwith be canceled. Until exchanged as
contemplated by this Section 2.09, any SplitCo Common Stock will be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such exchange Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.09. No
interest will be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon exchange of any
SplitCo Common Stock.

2.10 No Further Ownership Rights in SplitCo Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration issued (and paid) in accordance with the terms of this Article
II upon conversion of any shares of SplitCo Common Stock will be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of SplitCo Common Stock, and after the Effective Time there will
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of shares of SplitCo Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates formerly representing shares of SplitCo Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they will be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

2.11 No Fractional Shares. (c) No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Acquiror New Common Stock will be issued upon the
conversion of SplitCo Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.07, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any rights of a holder of Acquiror Common Stock. For purposes of this Section
2.11, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled
will be aggregated, and calculations will be rounded to three decimal places.

(d) Fractional shares of Acquiror New Common Stock that would otherwise be
allocable to any former holders of SplitCo Common Stock in the Merger will be
aggregated, and no holder of SplitCo Common Stock will receive cash equal to
or greater than the value of one full share of Acquiror New Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent will cause the whole shares obtained thereby to be sold, in the
open market or otherwise as reasonably directed by Parent, and in no case
later than 20 Business Days after the Effective Time. The Exchange Agent will
make available the net proceeds thereof, after deducting any required
withholding Taxes and brokerage charges, commissions and transfer Taxes, on a
pro rata basis, without interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of
SplitCo Common Stock entitled to receive such cash. Payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock will be made solely for the purpose
of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Acquiror of issuing fractional
shares of Acquiror New Common Stock and will not represent separately
bargained-for consideration.

2.12 Distributions With Respect To Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Acquiror New Common Stock with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any SplitCo Common
Stock with respect to the shares of Acquiror New Common Stock issuable upon
exchange thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares will be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.11, until, in each case, the
exchange of such SplitCo Common Stock in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to applicable Law, following the exchange of any such SplitCo Common
Stock, there will be paid to the holder of the certificate representing whole
shares of Acquiror New Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in
lieu of a fractional share of Acquiror New Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.11 and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Acquiror New Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such exchange payable with respect to such whole
shares of Acquiror New Common Stock.

2.13 Withholding Rights. Acquiror, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and the transfer agent, as the case may be, will deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise required to be distributed pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
distributed to the Persons otherwise entitled hereto.

2.14 No Liability. None of the Parties, the Exchange Agent and the transfer
agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of SplitCo Common
Stock or Acquiror New Common Stock (or in either case for any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

2.15 Closing Date Adjustment - Cut-Off Date Working Capital. (a) Not later
than the 10th Business Day following the Cut-Off Date, Parent will provide to
Acquiror its good faith estimate of the Cut-Off Date Working Capital (if such
amount exceeds the Working Capital Target, the absolute value of the
difference is the "Working Capital Excess," and if such amount is less than
the Working Capital Target, the absolute value of the difference is the
"Working Capital Deficit"). Such statement (as such statement is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.15, the "Cut-Off Date Adjustment
Statement") will be prepared (A) in a manner and format consistent with the
Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement Format and (B) using the most current and
most reliable financial information reasonably available to Parent in the
Ordinary Course of Parent's operations.

(b) Acquiror will review the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement and, if
Acquiror disagrees with any item set forth in such statement, it will provide
written notice to Parent (an "Acquiror Objection") within five Business Days
following receipt of the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement, and Parent and
Acquiror will attempt to resolve in good faith any such disagreements as soon
as practicable.

(c) If Parent and Acquiror are unable to resolve any of their disputes with
respect to the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement within two Business Days
following Parent's receipt of the Acquiror Objection pursuant to Section
2.15(b), either Party may refer the remaining disputed items to Ernst and Young
LLP or another independent accounting firm mutually selected by Parent and
Acquiror (the "Accounting Firm") to make a written determination as to each
then-remaining disputed item, which written determination will be final and
binding on the Parties as to each such disputed item. The Accounting Firm will
act as an arbitrator and not an expert and will address only those items that
are in dispute. With respect to any item of the Cut-Off Date Adjustment
Statement for which a determination is to be made by the Accounting Firm, the
Accounting Firm may only assign a value that is equal to the value for such
item claimed by either Party. The Parties will use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to have the Accounting Firm make its determination within
five Business Days of being engaged (and in any event prior to Closing). The
fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated between Parent, on
the one hand, and Acquiror, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the disputed items not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. The fees and disbursements of the
Representatives of each Party incurred in connection with their preparation of
the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement and preparation or review of any
Acquiror Objection, as applicable, will be borne by such Party.

(d) The Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement will become final and binding on the
Parties upon the earliest of (i) if no Acquiror Objection has been given, the
expiration of the period within which Acquiror must make its objection
pursuant to Section 2.15(b), (ii) the agreement in writing by Parent and
Acquiror that the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement, together with any
modifications thereto agreed by Parent and Acquiror, is final and binding, and
(iii) the date on which the Accounting Firm issues its written determination
with respect to any dispute relating to such Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement
pursuant to Section 2.15(c).

(e) If, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.15(d), (i) there is a
Working Capital Excess that is greater than 5.0% of the Working Capital Target
(the "Working Capital Band Amount"), then the Recapitalization Amount will be
increased by an amount equal to the Working Capital Excess, (ii) there is a
Working Capital Deficit that is greater than the Working Capital Band Amount,
then the Recapitalization Amount will be decreased by an amount equal to the
Working Capital Deficit and (iii) there is a Working Capital Excess or a
Working Capital Deficit that is equal to or less than the Working Capital Band
Amount, then the Recapitalization Amount shall not be increased or decreased
by this Section 2.15.

(f) In furtherance of this Section 2.15, upon the request of Acquiror, Parent
will promptly provide to Acquiror and its accountants access during normal
business hours to the books and records and any other information, and to any
employees of Parent or any other member of the Parent Group, that Acquiror
determines is reasonably necessary for Acquiror to review the Cut-Off Date
Adjustment Statement.

III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

Parent hereby represents and warrants to Acquiror that, except as (i) set
forth in the applicable section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter
(interpreted as contemplated by Section 10.13) or (ii) to the extent disclosed
in, and reasonably apparent from, any report, schedule, form or other document
filed with, or furnished to, the Commission by Parent or SplitCo and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement (other than any forward-looking
disclosures set forth in any risk factor section, any disclosures in any
section relating to forward-looking statements and any other similar
disclosures included therein to the extent that they are primarily cautionary
in nature) and as provided in Section 3.20 Acquiror acknowledges:

3.01 Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power. Each of Parent,
SplitCo and the Galleria Entities is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation. Parent and its Subsidiaries have the requisite corporate power
and authority to own, lease and operate their properties that will be
contributed to SplitCo or the Galleria Entities and to carry on the Galleria
Business as now being conducted and to enter into and perform its obligations
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to which it is, or will be, a
party and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or
operated by the Galleria Business that will be contributed to SplitCo or the
Galleria Entities or the nature of the Galleria Business conducted by it makes
such qualification or licensing necessary, except in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing has not been
and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the Galleria Business.

3.02 Authorization of Agreement. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by each of Parent and SplitCo, as
applicable, and the consummation by each of them of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized and approved by
their respective boards of directors (and this Agreement has been adopted by
Parent as the sole stockholder of SplitCo) and no other corporate or
shareholder action on the part of Parent or SplitCo is necessary to authorize
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which it is, or will be at the Business Transfer Time, a party,
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, when executed, will be duly executed
and delivered by each of Parent and SplitCo, as applicable, and each is (or
when executed will be) a valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
SplitCo enforceable against each of Parent and SplitCo, as applicable, in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may be
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Law affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by
general equitable principles (such exception, the "Enforceability Exception").

3.03 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Assuming (a) the filings required
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the
"HSR Act"), are made and the waiting periods thereunder (if applicable) have
been terminated or expired and any Governmental Approvals required under any
other Antitrust Law have been obtained or satisfied, (b) the Governmental
Approvals required to Convey any Real Property or Governmental Permits to
Acquiror have been made or obtained, (c) the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act are met, (d) the requirements under any
applicable state securities or blue sky Laws are met, (e) the requirements of
the NYSE in respect of the listing of the shares of Acquiror New Common Stock
to be issued hereunder are met and (f) the filing of the Certificate of Merger
and other appropriate merger documents, if any, as required by the DGCL, and
the filing of the Acquiror Certificate with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware pursuant to Section 2.05, are made, the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Parent and SplitCo,
the consummation by Parent and SplitCo of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby do not and will not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of
their respective certificates or articles of incorporation, bylaws or code of
regulations (or the comparable governing documents), (ii) violate or conflict
with any Law or Order of any Governmental Authority applicable to Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective properties or
assets that will be contributed to SplitCo or that are owned by the Galleria
Entities as of the Business Transfer Time may be bound, (iii) require any
Governmental Approval, or (iv) result in a violation or breach of, conflict
with, constitute (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a
default under or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration, or give rise to any obligation, right of termination,
cancellation, acceleration or increase of any obligation or a loss of a
material benefit under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Galleria Material Contract, excluding in the case of clauses (ii) through (iv)
above, (x) conflicts, violations, approvals, breaches, defaults, rights of
terminations, cancellations, accelerations, increases or losses which would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material
to the Galleria Business and (y) any Security Interests created in connection
with the Galleria Credit Facility.

3.04 Capital Structure; SplitCo. (c) On the date of this Agreement, the
authorized capital stock of SplitCo consisted solely of 1,000 shares of
SplitCo Common Stock, of which 100 shares of SplitCo Common Stock were
outstanding. On the date of this Agreement and immediately prior to the
Distribution, all of the outstanding shares of SplitCo Common Stock are and
will be owned directly by Parent free and clear of any Security Interest other
than Permitted Encumbrances. Immediately following the Distribution, (i) there
will be outstanding a number of shares of SplitCo Common Stock equal to the
Galleria Stock Amount, (ii) no shares of SplitCo Common Stock will be held in
SplitCo's treasury and (iii) no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of SplitCo or any of its Subsidiaries having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which holders of SplitCo Common Stock or the holders of capital stock of
any of SplitCo's Subsidiaries may vote will be outstanding. All outstanding
shares of SplitCo Common Stock are, and all such shares that may be issued
prior to the Effective Time as contemplated by this Agreement will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. As of
the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or authorized options,
warrants, rights, subscriptions, claims of any character, agreements,
obligations, convertible or exchangeable securities, or other commitments,
contingent or otherwise, relating to SplitCo Common Stock or any capital stock
equivalent or other nominal interest in SplitCo or any of its Subsidiaries
which relate to SplitCo (collectively, "Galleria Equity Interests") pursuant
to which SplitCo or any of its Subsidiaries is or may become obligated to
issue shares of its capital stock or other equity interests or any securities
convertible into, exchangeable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for,
any Galleria Equity Interests. There are no outstanding obligations of SplitCo
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding securities of
Galleria Equity Interests.

(d) Immediately prior to commencing the Restructuring, SplitCo will have no
Assets, other than the capital contribution with which such entity was
incorporated, and no Liabilities, other than de minimis Liabilities arising
under or in connection with its incorporation and Liabilities arising under or
in connection with this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement to which
SplitCo is or will be a party as contemplated hereby.

3.05 Intellectual Property. (c) Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent (including a
Galleria Entity) is the sole owner of the Galleria IP Assets, free and clear
of any Security Interests other than Permitted Encumbrances.

(d) Section 1.05(a)(vii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of
material Galleria IP Assets that constitute Registered Intellectual Property,
including for each such item listed, as applicable, its (i) territory, (ii)
application serial number and date, (iii) issue number and date, and (iv)
title or mark. All registration, maintenance and renewal fees, issue fees and
annuities due to any Governmental Authority in respect of such Galleria IP
Assets as of the date hereof have been paid. None of such Galleria IP Assets
is licensed to any third party or is subject to any material restrictions on
its disclosure, ownership, license or transfer, except pursuant to a Galleria
Material Contract listed in Section 3.08(a)(v) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter.

(e) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Galleria Business, to the Knowledge of Parent, the Galleria Business as
currently conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries does not, and, assuming the
Consents set forth on Section 3.03 of the Parent Disclosure Letter are
obtained, the Galleria Business immediately following the Closing will not,
infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any enforceable Intellectual
Property right of any third party. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Galleria Business, during the past two years, no
third party has made any written claim or demand or instituted any Action
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of Parent
threatened the same in writing, and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
has received any written notice of such a claim, demand or Action, that (i)
challenges the rights of Parent and its Subsidiaries in respect of any of the
Intellectual Property used in the Galleria Business or (ii) asserts that the
operation of the Galleria Business is or was infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating the Intellectual Property rights of any third party. None
of the Intellectual Property used in the Galleria Business is subject to any
outstanding Order applicable to the Galleria Business that materially limits
the use of such Intellectual Property in the Galleria Business as currently
conducted by Parent and its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, no
Person is engaging in any activity that materially infringes, misappropriates
or otherwise violates any of the Galleria IP Assets.

(f) Notwithstanding whether any other representations or warranties in this
Article III could be read to apply to matters involving Intellectual Property,
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02, Section 3.03,
Section 3.05, 3.08(a) (and Sections 3.08(b), 3.08(c) and 3.08(d) as applicable
thereto), Section 3.10, Section 3.11, Section 3.12, Section 3.14(a) (and
3.14(c) as applicable thereto), Section 3.15, Section 3.18 and Section 3.19
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties under this
Article III with respect to Intellectual Property.

3.06 Litigation. There are no Actions in respect of which Parent has been duly
served with a complaint or otherwise given written notice (or to the Knowledge
of Parent, oral notice) that are pending against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any of their respective properties, rights or
franchises), at Law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Authority,
that have been or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Galleria Business. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any Order applicable to any Galleria Entity or the
Galleria Business, other than any Order generally applicable to the businesses
in which the Galleria Business operates, that would reasonably be expected to
affect, in any material respect, individually or in the aggregate, the
Galleria Business.

3.07 Compliance With Laws. (c) Except as has not been and would not reasonably
be expected to be material to the Galleria Business, the Galleria Business is
being conducted in compliance with applicable Laws. None of the Governmental
Approvals required for the continued conduct of the Galleria Business as such
business is currently being conducted will lapse, terminate, expire or
otherwise be impaired as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or by the Ancillary Agreements, except as has not been and
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Galleria Business.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties set
forth in this Section 3.07 do not apply to Intellectual Property, employees
and employee benefits, Taxes or environmental matters, which are addressed in
Sections 3.05, 3.09, 3.11 (except as set forth therein) and 3.17,
respectively.

(d) Subject to Section 5.23, Parent has made available to Acquiror a true and

corporate or stockholder action on the part of Acquiror or any member of the

and the Ancillary Agreements, when executed, will be, duly executed and
delivered by Acquiror and, to the extent it is a party thereto, each is (or

this Agreement) or below, and (B) with respect to any employee who is at, or
hired into, the "Band 4" level or above (1) to fill a position within the
Adjusted Galleria Business existing on the date of this Agreement (a

Galleria Business after the date of this agreement (a "Non-Replacement Hire"),
provided that, in either case, Parent uses Commercially Reasonable Efforts to

as otherwise required by applicable Law or unless Parent determines in its
sole discretion that such arrangement or action would materially increase the
likelihood that the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would not apply to the
transactions contemplated hereby, no Non-Replacement Hire shall be an "In-

Package, and provided further, that except as otherwise required by applicable
Law or unless Parent determines in its sole discretion that such arrangement
or action would materially increase the likelihood that the Intended Tax-Free
Treatment would not apply to the transactions contemplated hereby, if such
position was previously held by an employee who did not have an Expatriate

will be a Choice Employee unless Acquiror elects within 30 days following

employee will not be an "In-Scope Employee";

(xxii) change the status of any In-Scope Employee that is "Band 3" level or

(j) From the Cut-Off Date until the Closing, except as expressly provided by
this Agreement, as set forth in Section 5.01(c) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter, as required in connection with the Restructuring or as expressly set

consented to in writing by Acquiror, Parent will cause the Galleria Business
to manage its levels of Assets and Liabilities in the line item categories
included in the Target Working Capital Statement in the Ordinary Course of the
Galleria Business. Parent will cause the Galleria Entities, collectively, to
hold an amount in cash or cash equivalents as of the Closing that, in the
aggregate, is at least equal to the amount of cash and cash equivalents that
are included in the calculation of Cut-Off Date Working Capital, as such
amount is finally determined pursuant to Section 2.15(d).

(k) Parent and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that (i) nothing contained in
this Agreement is intended to give (and does not give) Acquiror, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Galleria
Business or SplitCo or the Galleria Entities prior to the Closing, and (ii)
prior to the Closing, Parent will, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, control the operations of the Galleria Business and the
Galleria Group.

5.02 Further Assurances; Efforts To Obtain Consents; Antitrust Clearance. (e)
Generally. In addition to the actions specifically provided for elsewhere in
this Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement, each of the Parties will
cooperate with each other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to use) their reasonable best efforts, prior to,
at and after the Closing Date, to take, or to cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or to cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary on its part
under applicable Law or contractual obligations to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements as promptly as practicable, including, if applicable, forming legal
entities, opening bank accounts and reaffirming any consents, approvals or
waivers previously granted; provided, however, that (i) with respect to the
matters that are the subject of Section 1.08, such matters will be governed by
that Section instead of this Section 5.02(a) following the Closing, (ii)
except as otherwise provided in Section 5.02(b)-(c), neither Parent nor
Acquiror will be required to make any non-de minimis payments, incur any non-
de minimis Liability or offer or grant any non-de minimis accommodation
(financial or otherwise) to any third party in connection with obtaining any
Consent or Governmental Approval, (iii) subject to Section 1.09, the Acquiror
will be solely responsible for obtaining the Consents required in respect of
the Mercury Licenses (provided that Parent will reasonably cooperate with
Acquiror's requests in respect thereof) and (iv) for the avoidance of doubt,
this Section 5.02 will not be deemed to limit in any respect Parent's exercise
of discretion under Section 2.01 or Section 2.02.

(f) Requisite Antitrust Filings. Parent and Acquiror will comply fully with
all applicable notification, reporting and other requirements of applicable
Antitrust Laws in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Parent and Acquiror, as soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and in any event within 15 days after the date of this Agreement,
will furnish to the other on an outside-counsel basis such necessary
information and assistance as the other may reasonably request so as to enable
the Parties to evaluate which jurisdictions may require, under Antitrust Laws,
notification or reporting of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements. As soon as practicable after the end of such
15-day period, and in any case, within 30 days of the date of this Agreement,
each of Parent and Acquiror will determine and identify in writing a list of
jurisdictions (the "Identified Jurisdictions"), where in its reasonable
opinion, based on such exchange of information and assistance and the advice
of appropriately qualified outside counsel, a failure to file would be
reasonably likely to expose it to a risk of financial penalties or other
sanctions (including post-Closing sanctions or remedies such as the unwinding
of the transactions). Parent and Acquiror, as soon as practicable after the
end of such 30 day period, will file the required notifications with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities in the Identified Jurisdictions pursuant
to and in compliance with the HSR Act and make other filings under Antitrust
Laws in those jurisdictions. In the event that Parent and Acquiror are unable
to agree on the list of Identified Jurisdictions within 30 days of the date of
this Agreement, then Parent and Acquiror will submit their respective lists of
Identified Jurisdictions on which they disagree (each, a "Potential Identified
Jurisdiction") to an internationally recognized law firm having expertise in
antitrust matters and with no material relationships with either Parent or
Acquiror (such law firm to be agreed by Parent and Acquiror in good faith and
if they are unable to agree, to be drawn by lot from up to three such firms
submitted by each of Parent and Acquiror). Parent and Acquiror will use their
respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the selected firm to
select any additional Identified Jurisdictions from the Potential Identified
Jurisdictions within ten Business Days, based solely on the information that
has been shared between the Parties pursuant to, and the standards set forth
in, this Section 5.02(b). Parent and Acquiror's agreed list of Identified
Jurisdictions, plus any additional jurisdictions identified by such law firm,
will be the "Identified Jurisdictions." Parent and Acquiror will share the
costs and expenses of the law firm equally. Parent and Acquiror will as soon
as practicable file any additional information reasonably requested by any
Governmental Authority in connection with any Antitrust Law.

(g) Efforts To Obtain Antitrust Approvals. (h) Parent and Acquiror will each
use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or terminate, as the case may be, as
soon as practicable, the Governmental Approvals required by any Antitrust Law
(the "Antitrust Approvals") that may be or become necessary for the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and
will cooperate fully with each other in promptly seeking to obtain such
Antitrust Approvals or terminate any waiting period thereunder, all such
actions to be effective prior to the Closing. Acquiror and Parent will
cooperate in connection with the antitrust defense of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any investigation or litigation by, or negotiations
with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby or regulatory filings under applicable Antitrust Laws.
Without limiting the foregoing and subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Authority, each of Parent and Acquiror
agrees with respect to obtaining any Antitrust Approval to (A) cooperate and
consult with each other, (B) furnish to the other such necessary information
and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any notifications or filings, (C) keep each other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by such party from, or given by such
party to, any third party or any Governmental Authority with respect to such
transactions, (D) permit the other Party to review and consider in good faith
the other party's reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it
to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining the necessary
Antitrust Approvals, (E) provide prompt notice to the other Party of any
meeting or substantive discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (F) not participate in any meeting or substantive discussion,
either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby unless, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Authority, it gives the other party the
opportunity to attend, participate and observe; provided that Parent and
Acquiror shall not be required to provide the other with information to the
extent that it is commercially sensitive; provided, further, that such
commercially sensitive information will be made available only to legal
counsel of the recipient Party and the recipient Party shall procure that such
legal counsel shall not further disclose such information without the prior
written consent of the relevant disclosing Party.

(xxv) Subject to the last sentence of this clause (ii) and to Section
5.02(c)(iii), in furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants contained
in Section 5.02(c)(i) or any other provision of this Agreement, Acquiror will
offer to take (and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all necessary
steps to eliminate impediments under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby so as to permit such transactions to be consummated as promptly as
practicable and to prevent a prohibition decision or the entry of any Order
(or if such Order is so entered, to eliminate such Order or otherwise cause it
to be satisfied or cease to be a restraint on such transactions) sought by any
Governmental Authority or private Person under any Antitrust Law that would
result in the failure of any condition to the obligations of the Parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to be satisfied. Such steps
may include, whether effected by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, (A) the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses of Acquiror or, effective as of the Closing, such assets of the
Galleria Business and (B) committing to take any action which Acquiror is
capable of taking, including agreements that limit Acquiror's freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the Galleria
Business, services or assets of Acquiror or any of its Affiliates or any
Assets of the Galleria Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) in no case
will Acquiror (or, if applicable, Parent) be required pursuant to this clause
(ii) to offer or commit to take any step that is not conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Closing, (2) in no event will Acquiror offer or commit to
take, or cause or permit SplitCo or any of its Subsidiaries to offer or commit
to take, any action prohibited under the Tax Matters Agreement and (3) nothing
in this clause (ii) will be deemed to modify the arrangements set forth in
Schedule 1.09 in respect of the Mercury Licenses.

(xxvi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (but subject to
compliance with Acquiror's obligation to use reasonable best efforts to
obtain, or terminate, the Antitrust Approvals as soon as practicable pursuant
to Section 5.02(c)(i)), Acquiror will (A) have the right to determine and
direct the strategy and process by which the parties will seek, and to make
the final decision on which steps to take in obtaining, the Antitrust
Approvals and (B) take the lead in all joint meetings and communications with
any Governmental Authority.

(i) With respect to any Retained Licenses, the Retained Businesses and any
Assets that are Excluded Assets by virtue of Section 1.09, all obligations
under this Section 5.02 will cease as of any Retained Business Cut-Off Date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to any Retained Business Cut-Off Date,
this Section 5.02 will remain in full force and effect with respect to all
elements of the Galleria Business that had not yet become Retained Businesses
without giving effect to Section 1.09.

5.03 Public Announcements. The press release(s) announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby will be in
the forms attached as Exhibits B-1 and B-2 (the "Transaction Announcement").
The Parties further agree that the Acquiror investor presentation to be made
in connection with the announcement of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be in substantially the form previously agreed to by Parent and
Acquiror and that both the initial press release and the investor presentation
concerning the transactions contemplated hereby will be filed by Acquiror as
exhibits to a Form 8-K filing promptly after the execution of this Agreement.
From the date hereof through the Closing, and without limiting the effect of
Section 5.12, neither Parent nor Acquiror will publish any press releases or
make other public statements (including to securities analysts) that
contradicts the Transaction Announcement with respect to this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby (or the portion
thereof relating to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby), except as such Party determines in good
faith is required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with any national securities exchange after consultation with counsel (in
which case, such Party will consult with the other Party to the extent
reasonably practicable under the circumstances prior to making such disclosure
and will only disclose that information that is required by Law based upon
advice of counsel), without the prior approval of the other Party, such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

5.04 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Parent and Acquiror will give
prompt written notice to the other of (a) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (b) any Action
commenced or threatened in writing against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting it or any of its Affiliates that relate to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.05 Financial Statements. (g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the
Final Retained Business Cut-Off Date and using its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to deliver within 60 Business Days of the Final Retained Business Cut-
Off Date, Parent will provide Acquiror with the combined audited financial
statements of the Adjusted Galleria Business, including the balance sheets of
June 30, 2015, June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, and the income statements of
the Adjusted Galleria Business for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, June
30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, together with the notes thereto and accompanied by
unqualified opinions of the independent accountants.

(h) Parent will also provide Acquiror with (i) quarterly combined unaudited
financial statements of the Adjusted Galleria Business as of and for each
fiscal quarter no later than 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter,
beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2015, including the
balance sheets and the income statement of the Adjusted Galleria Business,
together with the notes thereto, and (ii) the combined audited financial
statements of the Adjusted Galleria Business as of and for the fiscal year
ending on June 30, 2016 no later than 90 days after the end of such fiscal
year, including the balance sheets and the income statement of the Adjusted
Galleria Business, together with the notes thereto and accompanied by
unqualified opinions of the independent accountants.

5.06 Conduct of Acquiror Pending The Closing. (e) Except as expressly provided
by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, as set forth on Section 5.06 of
the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as required by applicable Law or as expressly
consented to in writing by Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the Pre-Closing Period Acquiror and
each of its Subsidiaries will use its respective Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to, (i) conduct the Acquiror's business in the Ordinary Course of the
Acquiror's business in all material respects, (ii) preserve (other than the
sale of Assets in the Ordinary Course of the Acquiror's business) the material
Assets of the Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, (iii) preserve in all material
respects the material business relationships of the Acquiror business with
customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and others with whom the
Acquiror business deals in the Ordinary Course of the Acquiror business, and
(iv) maintain the goodwill and reputation of the Acquiror business in all
material respects, including through advertising, marketing and promoting the
products of the Acquiror business in the Ordinary Course of the Acquiror
business. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, during the Pre-Closing
Period, Acquiror may, without breach of this Agreement, take such actions as
it determines in good faith are commercially reasonable to (w) respond to
events resulting, in whole or in part, from the announcement of this
Agreement, (x) consummate transactions set forth on Section 5.06 of the
Acquiror Disclosure Letter, (y) preserve the Acquiror business and existing
material employee, customer and supplier relationships (including replacing
any employees of the Acquiror business who cease to be employed by Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries) and (z) seek to receive any Consent in respect of the
Mercury Licenses.

(f) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.06(a), and except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, as set forth on Section 5.06 of the
Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as required by applicable Law or as expressly
consented to in writing by Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), during the Pre-Closing Period, Acquiror
will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to:

(i) sell, pledge, dispose of, transfer, lease, license, guarantee, encumber or
authorize the sale, pledge, disposition, transfer, lease, license, guarantee
or encumbrance of any Assets that are (or would otherwise be) material to the
Acquiror business (excluding Assets constituting Intellectual Property,
provision for which is made in Section 5.06(b)(vii) and Section
5.06(b)(viii)), other than any sale of product inventories, raw and packaging
materials, Store Room Inventory, Goods in Transit, parts, work-in-process,

Ordinary Course of the Acquiror business;

(ii) declare, set aside, make or pay any dividends or other distribution,
payable in cash, stock, property or otherwise, with respect to any of its

contemplated hereunder or otherwise conduct the Acquiror business following
the Closing in any geographic area or in any other material respect;

(xiv) agree, in writing or otherwise, to take any of the foregoing actions.

(g) Parent and Acquiror acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to give (and does not give) Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Acquiror's
business or Acquiror or its Affiliates prior to the Closing.

5.07 Access. (p) From the date hereof to the Closing, to the extent permitted
by Law, each of Parent and Acquiror will allow all designated Representatives
of the other Party access to the extent reasonably practicable upon reasonable
notice to the books, records, files, correspondence, audits and properties
pertaining to the business and affairs of the Galleria Business and Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries including as to matters that might arise outside the
Ordinary Course of the Galleria Business or the business of the Acquiror
Group; provided, however, that (i) no investigation pursuant to this Section
5.07 will affect any representation or warranty given by any Party hereunder
or any closing condition, indemnity obligation or other provision and (ii)
notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation by any Party, no
Party will be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) no
Party will be required to provide any information which it determines in good
faith it may not provide to the other Party by reason of applicable Law
(including any information in confidential personnel files), or which such
Party determines in good faith constitutes information protected by attorney-
client or other similar privilege; provided, however, that if any information
is so prohibited to be provided, the applicable Party will use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to take those actions reasonably necessary so that such
Party is able to provide such information to the other Party as promptly as
possible and (B) no Party will be required to provide access to any of its
properties in a manner that will result in damage to such property or for the
purpose of performing any invasive onsite procedure or investigation such as a
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment or other invasive onsite environmental
sampling, investigation or study, without the other Party's written consent,
which may be granted or denied in its discretion. Each of Parent and Acquiror
agrees that it will not, and will cause its respective Representatives not to,
use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.07 for any purpose
unrelated to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. All information
provided by a Party to the other Party hereunder will be kept confidential to
the same extent as would be applicable if the Confidentiality Agreement were
in effect.

(q) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(i) each of Parent and Acquiror will deliver or otherwise make available for
inspection to the other Party within 60 days after the date of this Agreement
true, complete and correct copies and results of any material reports, data,
investigations, audits, assessments (including Phase I environmental site
assessments and Phase II environmental site assessments) studies, analyses,
tests or monitoring in the possession of or reasonably available to Parent or
Acquiror, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries that were
prepared during the five years prior to the date of this Agreement pertaining
to: (i) any unresolved Environmental Claims; (ii) any Hazardous Materials in,
on, beneath or adjacent to any Real Property or any property formerly owned,
operated or leased by Parent or Acquiror or any of their respective
Subsidiaries; or (iii) Parent's or Acquiror's or any of their respective
Subsidiaries' compliance with applicable Environmental Laws, in each case
relating to, resulting from or arising out of the operation or conduct of the
Galleria Business (in the case of Parent) or the Acquiror's business (in the
case of Acquiror); and

(ii) after the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Parent will deliver such
information as Acquiror may reasonably request regarding the identity of the
Mercury Fragrance Products and Non-Mercury Fragrance Products and Non-
Hydroalcoholic Products in which Parent Ancillary Fragrances are utilized,
including a listing of the names of such products, such delivery to be made
reasonably promptly.

5.08 Acquiror Stockholder Consent; Preparation of SEC Filings. (r) No later
than 24 hours after the execution of this Agreement and in lieu of calling a
meeting of the Acquiror's shareholders, Acquiror shall submit a form of
irrevocable written consent attached hereto as Exhibit C to a shareholder
representing at least 50.1% of the voting power represented by the outstanding
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (such written consent, as duly executed and
delivered by such shareholder, the "Stockholder Consent"). As soon as
practicable upon receipt of the Stockholder Consent, Acquiror will provide
Parent with a copy of such Stockholder Consent. In connection with the
Stockholder Consent, Acquiror shall take all actions necessary to comply, and
shall comply in all respects, with the DGCL, the Acquiror's certificate of
incorporation and the Acquiror Bylaws.

(s) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
after the financial statements referenced in Section 5.05 have become
available, Parent and Acquiror will jointly prepare, and (i) Acquiror will
file with the Commission a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the "Acquiror
Form S-4") to register the shares of Acquiror New Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger, and prepare and file with the Commission an information statement
of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act
related to the Transaction and this Agreement (as amended or supplemented from
time to time, the "Information Statement"), (ii) SplitCo will file with the
Commission a registration statement on Form 10 and/or a registration statement
on Form S-4 (the "SplitCo Form 10/S-4") to register the shares of SplitCo
Common Stock to be distributed in the Distribution, (iii) Parent will file
with the Commission a Schedule TO (the "Schedule TO", together with the
Acquiror Form S-4, the Information Statement and the SplitCo Form 10/S-4, the
"SEC Filings") if Parent elects to effect the Distribution in whole or in part
by means of an Exchange Offer and (iv) the Parties will file such other
appropriate documents as may be applicable. Each of Parent and Acquiror will
use their reasonable best efforts to have the SEC Filings cleared or declared
effective, as applicable, under the Exchange Act or Securities Act, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments by the Commission and subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the applicable conditions in Article VII and it being understood
that the SEC Filings will not be filed until after the financial statements
referenced in Section 5.05 have become available). As promptly as practicable
after the Information Statement shall have been cleared by the Commission (or
after 10 calendar days have passed since the filing of the preliminary
Information Statement with the Commission without notice from the Commission
of its intent to review the Information Statement), Acquiror shall cause the
Information Statement to be mailed to its shareholders and to be filed as
required. Each of Acquiror and Parent will also take any action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with, in the case of Acquiror, the issuance of Acquiror New Common
Stock in the Merger and, in the case of Parent, the issuance of SplitCo Common
Stock in the Distribution.

(t) Parent will furnish all information concerning Parent and SplitCo, and
Acquiror will furnish all information concerning Acquiror and Merger Sub, as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the
preparation, filing and distribution of each of the SEC Filings. Each of
Parent and Acquiror shall otherwise promptly cooperate as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation and filing of each of
the SEC Filings, including, without limitation, assistance with the
preparation of the pro forma financial information as necessary. No filing of,
or amendment or supplement to the Information Statement or the Acquiror Form
S-4 will be made by Acquiror, no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the
SplitCo Form 10/S-4 will be made by SplitCo and no filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Schedule TO will be made by Parent, in each case without
providing the other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to Parent or Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by Parent or Acquiror which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any of the Information Statement, as
applicable, the Acquiror Form S-4, the SplitCo Form 10/S-4 or the Schedule TO,
so that any such document would not include any misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the Party which discovers such information will promptly notify
the other Parties and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information will be promptly filed with the Commission and, to the extent
required by Law, disseminated to the applicable stockholders. The Parties will
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the Commission
or its staff and of any request by the Commission or its staff for amendments
or supplements to any of the SEC Filings or for additional information and
will supply each other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of
its representative, on the one hand, and the Commission or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect thereto and will respond as promptly as practicable
to any such comments or requests.

5.09 No Solicitation. (l) Acquiror will, and will cause its Representatives
to, cease immediately any discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquiror
Takeover Proposal. Except as provided in Section 5.09(b), Acquiror will not,
nor will it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor will it
authorize or permit any Representative of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries
to (and will instruct such Representatives not to), directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of any Acquiror Takeover
Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish to any Person any information with respect to, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquiror Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the two preceding sentences by any
Representative or Affiliate of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or
not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of Acquiror or any of its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, will be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.09
by Acquiror.

(m) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.09(a), prior to receipt of the
Acquiror Stockholder Approval, Acquiror may, if the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of Acquiror to the stockholders of Acquiror under applicable Law, as
determined in good faith by such board after consulting with outside legal
counsel, in response to a Qualifying Acquiror Takeover Proposal (and subject
to compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.09):

(i) furnish information with respect to Acquiror to the Person making such
Qualifying Acquiror Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other Party than the
Confidentiality Agreement (provided that all such information has previously
been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person); and

(ii) participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person and its
Representatives regarding such Qualifying Acquiror Takeover Proposal.

(n) Neither the Board of Directors of Acquiror nor any committee thereof may
(i) withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or SplitCo, or publicly
propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or SplitCo, the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of
Directors of Acquiror of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the Acquiror
Stockholder Approval, (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or permit Acquiror or
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
merger agreement or similar agreement relating to any Acquiror Takeover
Proposal, or (iii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquiror Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Acquiror Stockholder Approval, the
Board of Directors of Acquiror receives an Acquiror Superior Proposal and as a
result thereof the Board of Directors of Acquiror determines in good faith,
after consulting with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Acquiror under applicable Law, then, on the fifth Business Day following
Parent's receipt of written notice from Acquiror, the Board of Directors of
Acquiror may withdraw or modify its recommendation of the Acquiror Stockholder
Approval and, in connection therewith, recommend such Acquiror Superior
Proposal; provided that, during such five-Business Day period, Acquiror will
be obligated to negotiate in good faith with Parent and SplitCo any
modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent or SplitCo; provided,
further, that in the event of any material change to the material terms of
such Acquiror Superior Proposal, Acquiror shall have delivered to Parent an
additional notice and the notice period shall have recommenced.

(o) Acquiror will, as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any case
within 24 hours), advise Parent orally and in writing of any Acquiror Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected
to lead to any Acquiror Takeover Proposal, and the identity of the Person
making any such Acquiror Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material terms
of any such Acquiror Takeover Proposal or inquiry. Acquiror will (i) keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status including any change to the material
terms of any such Acquiror Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to
Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any case within 24 hours)
after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to Acquiror from any third party in
connection with any Acquiror Takeover Proposal or sent or provided by Acquiror
to any third party in connection with any Acquiror Takeover Proposal.

(p) Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 will prohibit Acquiror from taking
and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 or
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required
disclosure to Acquiror's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Board of Directors of Acquiror after consulting with outside legal counsel,
failure so to disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable Law; provided, however, that this Section 5.09(e) will not
eliminate or modify (x) Acquiror's obligations under the proviso in Section
5.09(b) or (y) the effect that taking and disclosing any such position would
otherwise have under this Agreement (including under Section 8.01(d)(i)).

(q) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Acquiror Takeover Proposal" means (A) any proposal for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination
involving Acquiror, (B) any proposal or offer for the issuance by Acquiror of
over 15% of its equity securities as consideration for the assets or
securities of another Person, or (C) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, over 15% of the equity securities or
consolidated assets of Acquiror, or assets or business that constitute over
15% of the consolidated revenues or net income of Acquiror, in each case other
than the transactions contemplated hereby.

(ii) "Qualifying Acquiror Takeover Proposal" means a bona fide, written
Acquiror Takeover Proposal that (A) is made by a Person the Board of Directors
of Acquiror determines, in good faith, after consulting with outside counsel
and independent financial advisors, is reasonably capable of making an
Acquiror Superior Proposal, (B) the Board of Directors of Acquiror determines,
in good faith, after consulting with its independent financial advisor,
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to an Acquiror Superior Proposal,
and (C) that was not solicited by Acquiror and did not otherwise result from a
breach of this Section 5.09.

(iii) "Acquiror Superior Proposal" means any bona fide proposal made by a
third party to acquire more than 50% of the equity securities or all or
substantially all the assets of Acquiror, pursuant to a tender or exchange
offer, a merger, a consolidation, a liquidation or dissolution, a
recapitalization, a sale of all or substantially all its assets or otherwise,
on terms which the Board of Directors of Acquiror determines in its good-faith
judgment after consulting with its independent financial advisor (A) to be
superior from a financial point of view to the holders of Acquiror Common
Stock than the transactions contemplated hereby, taking into account all the
terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby)
and (B) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal.

5.10 NYSE Listing. Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to
be listed on the NYSE as of the Effective Time, subject to official notice of
issuance.

5.11 Required Amendments. Except as otherwise provided in respect of
amendments to the Transition Plan (and any resulting changes to the Transition
Services Agreement and the schedules thereto) in Section 5.21, the Parties
will cooperate and negotiate in good faith with respect to any amendment to
the Transaction Documents reasonably requested by a Party in order to enable
its counsel to deliver the written opinion(s) contemplated by Sections 7.02 or
7.03 of this Agreement, as the case may be (any such amendment, a "Proposed
Amendment"). Neither Party will withhold its consent to a Proposed Amendment
that (i) does not result in any change in the Merger Consideration, (ii) is
not materially adverse to the interests of any Party, and (iii) does not
unreasonably impede or delay consummation of the Distribution or the Merger.
Any Proposed Amendment that the Parties consent to will be reflected through
the execution of appropriate written amendments to the applicable Transaction
Documents.

5.12 Capital Transactions.(j) Galleria Commitment Letter. Attached hereto as
Exhibit L is a true and complete fully executed copy of the commitment letter
relating to the Galleria Credit Facility (the "Galleria Commitment Letter").
The Galleria Credit Facility will remain outstanding, without amendment and
without amortization, for at least one year following the Closing Date;
provided, however, that, if SplitCo receives a Bank Letter, SplitCo will be
permitted to refinance the Galleria Facility with new debt (the "Refinanced
Facility") that has substantially similar terms, the same maturity date, and
the same prepayment restrictions as the Galleria Credit Facility. SplitCo must
be the primary obligor on the Refinanced Facility and must remain the primary
obligor on the Refinanced Facility at all times during such remaining term.
After the Closing, Acquiror shall be permitted to guarantee SplitCo's
obligations under the Galleria Credit Facility or the Refinanced Facility, if,
in each case, SplitCo receives a Bank Letter. To the extent any prepayments of
the Galleria Credit Facility or the Refinanced Facility are permitted
hereunder, such prepayments will be made, in each case, solely (I) out of
SplitCo's and its Subsidiaries' operating cash flows generated on or after the
Closing Date or (II) as otherwise required by the terms of the Galleria Credit
Facility or the Refinanced Facility, as applicable.

(k) Creation of Galleria Credit Facility. Parent will cause SplitCo to use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange
and obtain the Galleria Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Galleria Commitment Letter, including using its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to, negotiate and enter into the Galleria Credit Documents on the
terms and conditions contemplated by the Galleria Commitment Letter and after
reasonable consultation with Acquiror. If any portion of the Galleria
Financing becomes, or would reasonably be expected to become, unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Galleria Commitment Letter (after
taking into account, and exercising, any flex terms), or if the monies
borrowed under the Galleria Financing are insufficient to fund the payment of
the Recapitalization Amount by SplitCo, then, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein:

(xv) if any portion of the Galleria Financing becomes, or would reasonably be
expected to become, unavailable on such terms and conditions, SplitCo will
seek to obtain alternative financing (and in such circumstance if alternative
financing is available, SplitCo may obtain such alternative financing),
including from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to replace any
unavailable portion of the Galleria Financing on terms and conditions that are
substantially similar in all material respects to the terms of the Galleria
Commitment Letter and after reasonable consultation with Acquiror; and

(xvi) if the Galleria Financing is insufficient to so fund the payment of the
Recapitalization Amount by SplitCo, SplitCo will seek to obtain additional
financing (and in such circumstance if additional financing is available,
SplitCo may obtain such additional financing), including from alternative
sources, in an amount sufficient to borrow such additional monies as may be
necessary to fund such shortfall, which additional financing will be on the
most favorable terms reasonably available under the circumstances and after
reasonable consultation with Acquiror (and, in a circumstance in which the
amount of the Galleria Financing reflected in the Galleria Commitment Letter,
together with any additional financing obtained pursuant to this clause (ii),
is insufficient to so fund the payment of the Recapitalization Amount, the
Parties will negotiate in good faith so as to provide Parent with equivalent
value) (the arrangements in clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, an "Alternative
Financing");

provided that the terms of any such Alternative Financing must be consistent
with the Intended Tax-Free Treatment as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion. All references herein to the Galleria Financing will be deemed to
include such Alternative Financing and all references to Galleria Credit
Documents will include the applicable documents for the Alternative Financing.

(l) Cooperation Regarding Galleria Credit Facility. Each of Parent and
Acquiror will reasonably cooperate with SplitCo in connection with completing
the Galleria Financing, including (i) using (and causing their respective
Subsidiaries to use) Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist SplitCo in
satisfying all conditions precedent to be satisfied by SplitCo or any Galleria
Subsidiary in the Galleria Credit Documents, (ii) providing information
regarding the Galleria Business that is reasonably requested by the Debt
Financing Sources and their representatives, including such information
required by the Galleria Commitment Letter, (iii) permitting the Debt
Financing Sources and their representatives access to the Galleria Business
and the relevant businesses of Acquiror and its Subsidiaries, respectively,
(iv) participating in, and assisting with, marketing efforts related to the
Galleria Credit Facility, including causing its management team and other
representatives to participate in (A) meetings with prospective lenders, (B)
bank meetings in connection with the financing and (C) meetings with ratings
agencies and other parties deemed appropriate, (v) causing members of their
respective accounting firms to participate in drafting sessions related to the
offering materials, if any, for the financing contemplated by the Galleria
Credit Documents and (vi) delivery of documentation and other information
required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation the
PATRIOT Act (as may be amended from time to time). Parent hereby consents to
the use of all logos associated with the Galleria Business in connection with
obtaining the Galleria Credit Facility; provided, however, that such logos are
used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Galleria Business, Parent, SplitCo or any of their
Subsidiaries.

(m) Cooperation Regarding Distribution. Acquiror will cooperate with Parent in
connection with the preparation of all documents and the making of all filings
required in connection with the Distribution. Parent will be permitted to
reasonably direct and control the efforts of the Parties in connection with
the Distribution, and Acquiror will use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all other
things reasonably necessary to facilitate the Distribution as reasonably
directed by Parent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Acquiror
will and will cause its employees, advisors, agents, accountants, counsel and
other representatives to, as reasonably directed by Parent, cooperate in and
take the following actions: (i) participating in meetings, drafting sessions,
due diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, and "road shows" in
connection with the Distribution (including any marketing efforts), (ii)
furnishing to any dealer manager or other similar agent participating in the
Distribution (A) "cold comfort" letters from Acquiror's independent public
accountants in customary form and covering such matters as are customary for
an underwritten public offering (including with respect to events subsequent
to the date of financial statements included in any offering document) and (B)
opinions and negative assurance letters of Acquiror's counsel in customary
form and covering such matters as may be reasonably requested, and (iii)
furnishing all historical and forward-looking financial and other pertinent
financial and other information that is available to Acquiror and is
reasonably required in connection with the Distribution and permitting the
prospective underwriters and other parties involved in the Distribution to
evaluate Acquiror's current assets, cash management and accounting systems,
and policies and procedures relating thereto, for the purpose of establishing
necessary arrangements with respect to the Distribution. Without limiting the
foregoing, (x) Acquiror will participate, as reasonably requested by Parent,
in a two-week equity "road show" to take place prior to the consummation of
the Distribution (which may be for a shorter period, at Parent's option), and
will make available individual members of its senior personnel (including its
CEO and CFO) for participation in this road show as reasonably requested and
specified by Parent, (y) Acquiror will make available individual members of
its senior personnel for participation as reasonably requested and specified
by Parent for participation in meeting with analysts (both "sell-side" and
otherwise) and will reasonably coordinate and cooperate with Parent in
connection with such meetings, and (z) the Parties will perform the marketing
activities set forth in Section 5.13(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter as
provided therein.

(n) Acquiror Refinancing. Attached hereto as Exhibit M is a true and complete
fully executed copy of the commitment letter relating to the Acquiror
Financing (the "Acquiror Commitment Letter"). From the date hereof through the
Closing Date, each of Parent and SplitCo will cooperate in a commercially
reasonable manner with Acquiror in connection with the efforts of Acquiror to
complete the Acquiror Financing, including (i) providing information regarding
the Galleria Business that is reasonably requested by the Debt Financing
Sources and their representatives, including such information required by the
Acquiror Commitment Letter, (ii) permitting the Debt Financing Sources and
their representatives reasonable access to the Galleria Business, (iii)
participating in, and assisting with, marketing efforts related to such
refinancing, including causing management team and other representatives to
participate in (A) meetings with prospective lenders, (B) bank meetings in
connection with any refinancing and (C) meetings with ratings agencies and
other parties deemed appropriate and (iv) delivery of documentation and other
information required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without
limitation the PATRIOT Act. Parent hereby consents to the use of all logos
associated with the Galleria Business in connection with obtaining the
Acquiror Financing; provided, however, that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Galleria Business, Parent, SplitCo or any of their Subsidiaries. Acquiror will
use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to arrange and obtain the Acquiror Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Acquiror Commitment Letter, including using its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to (x) negotiate and enter into the credit agreement and
related agreements and documents in respect thereof on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Acquiror Commitment Letter, (y) obtain the
financing contemplated thereby (which will be deemed to include exercising any
flex terms if necessary) and (z) obtain alternate refinancing if any portion
of the Acquiror Financing becomes, or would reasonably be expected to become,
unavailable; provided, further, that Acquiror shall have the right to modify
or waive any of its rights under the Acquiror Commitment Letter, and/or
substitute other debt financing for all or any portion of the Acquiror
Financing from the same and/or alternative financing sources, in order to
obtain more favorable terms with respect thereto, to the extent that such
terms are, at such time, generally available in the market to companies that
are similarly situated from a credit perspective to Acquiror; provided,
however, that Acquiror shall provide written notice to Parent at least 5
Business Days prior to any such proposed modification or waiver; and provided,
further, however, that any such modification to or waiver of any provision of
the Acquiror Commitment Letter or such substitute debt financing for all or a
portion of the Acquiror Financing shall not (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Acquiror Financing (such that the aggregate funds that would be available
to Acquiror would not be sufficient to provide the funds required to
consummate such refinancing), (ii) add or expand the conditions precedent or
contingencies to the funding of the Acquiror Debt Financing as set forth in
the Acquiror Commitment Letter, (iii) materially increase the likelihood that
the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would not apply to the transactions
contemplated hereby, as determined by Parent in its sole discretion or (iv)
unreasonably impede or delay the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article VII.

5.13 Agreement for Exchange of Information. (a) Generally. (i) Except as
otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement or as prohibited by
applicable Law, each Party, on behalf of its respective Group, will provide,
or cause to be provided, to the other Party's Group, at any time after the
Closing Date and until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, as soon as
reasonably practicable after written request therefor, any Shared Information
in its possession or under its control. Each of Parent and Acquiror agree to
make their respective personnel available during regular business hours to
discuss the Information exchanged pursuant to this Section 5.13.

(ii) Each Party will provide to the other such Information as the other may
from time to time reasonably request in order to prepare its financial
statements and satisfy its public reporting obligations.

(iii) Prior to the Closing, each Party will take measures that it determines
in good faith to be appropriate to ensure that any competitively sensitive
Shared Information from one Party is not disclosed to the other Party's
personnel involved in a competing business.

(b) Ownership of Information. Any Information owned by a Party that is
provided to the other Party pursuant to this Section 5.13 remains the property
of the Party that owned and provided such Information. Each Party will, and
will cause members of their respective Groups to, remove and destroy any hard
drives or other electronic data storage devices from any computer or server
that is reasonably likely to contain Information that is protected by this
Section 5.13 and that is transferred or sold to a third party or otherwise
disposed of in accordance with Section 5.13(c), unless required by Law or bona
fide document retention policies to retain such materials.

(c) Record Retention. Each Party agrees to use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to retain all Information that relates to the operations of SplitCo
and the Galleria Business in its respective possession or control at the
Business Transfer Time in accordance with their respective then-existing
document retention policies, as such policies may be amended from time to
time.

(d) Other Agreements Providing for Exchange of Information. The rights and
obligations granted under this Section 5.13 are subject to any specific
limitations, qualifications or additional provisions on the sharing, exchange
or confidential treatment of Information set forth in this Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement.

(e) Compensation for Providing Information. The Party requesting Information
will reimburse the other Party for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs, if any,
of creating, gathering and copying such Information, to the extent that such
costs are incurred for the benefit of the requesting Party.

(f) Production of Witnesses; Records; Cooperation. (g) After the Closing Date,
except in the case of any Action by one Party or its Affiliates against
another Party or its Affiliates, each Party will use its Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to make available to each other Party, upon written
request, the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other
personnel and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and
any books, records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise
has the ability to make available, to the extent that any such Person (giving
consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees,
other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents are
reasonably requested in connection with any Action in which the requesting
Party may from time to time be involved.

(v) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to compromise or
settle any Third-Party Claim, the other Party will use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to make available to such Indemnifying Party, upon written request,
the former, current and future directors, officers, employees, other personnel
and agents of the members of its respective Group as witnesses and any books,
records or other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the
ability to make available, to the extent that any such Person (giving
consideration to business demands of such directors, officers, employees,
other personnel and agents) or books, records or other documents are
reasonably requested in connection with such defense, settlement or
compromise, or the prosecution, evaluation or pursuit thereof, as the case may
be.

(vi) The obligation of the Parties to provide witnesses pursuant to this
Section 5.13 is intended to be interpreted in a manner so as to facilitate
cooperation and will include the obligation to provide as witnesses managers
and other officers without regard to whether the witness or the employer of
the witness could assert a possible business conflict.

(h) Restrictions. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, no Party or member of such Party's Group grants or
confers rights of license in any Information owned by any member of such
Party's Group to any member of the other Party's Group hereunder.

5.14 Privileged Matters. (h) As to all communications among counsel for Parent
or the Parent Group (including Jones Day and in-house counsel of Parent or the
Parent Group), Parent and any other member of the Parent Group that relate in
any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or to Excluded
Liabilities (collectively, the "Privileged Communications"), the attorney-
client privilege and the expectation of client confidence belongs to Parent
and may be controlled by Parent and will not pass to or be claimed by
Acquiror, SplitCo, any Galleria Entity or any of their respective Affiliates.
The Privileged Communications are the property of Parent, and from and after
the Closing none of Acquiror, SplitCo, any Galleria Entity, any other member
of the Acquiror Group or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
the Acquiror (including a Continuing Employee), SplitCo, any Galleria Entity
or any other member of the Acquiror Group will seek to obtain such
communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
or through other means. As to any such Privileged Communications prior to the
Closing Date, Acquiror, SplitCo, each Galleria Entity and each other member of
the Acquiror Group, together with any of their respective Affiliates,
successors or assigns, further agree that no such Person may use or rely on
any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or involving any of
the Parties after the Closing. The Privileged Communications may be used by
Parent or any other member of the Parent Group in connection with any dispute
that relates in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including in any claim for indemnification brought by Acquiror.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Acquiror, SplitCo any Galleria Entity or any of their Affiliates and a third
party (other than a Party or any of their respective Affiliates) after the
Closing, Acquiror may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by counsel for Parent or the Parent
Group to such third party; provided, however, that neither Acquiror nor any of
its Affiliates may waive such privilege without the prior written consent of
Parent.

(i) Upon receipt by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates of any subpoena,
discovery or other request from any third party that actually or arguably
calls for the production or disclosure of Privileged Communications or if
Acquiror or any of its Affiliates obtains knowledge that any current or former
employee of Acquiror receives any subpoena, discovery or other request from
any third party that actually or arguably calls for the production or
disclosure of Privileged Communications Acquiror will promptly notify Parent
of the existence of the request and will provide Parent a reasonable
opportunity to assert any rights it may have under this Section 5.14 or
otherwise to prevent the production or disclosure of Privileged
Communications. Acquiror will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to,
produce or disclose to any third party any of the Privileged Communications
under this Section 5.14 unless (i) Parent has provided its express written
consent to such production or disclosure or (ii) a court of competent
jurisdiction has entered an Order finding that the Privileged Communications
are not entitled to protection from disclosure under any applicable privilege,
doctrine or rule.

(j) The access to Information, witnesses and individuals being granted
pursuant to Section 5.13 and the disclosure to Parent and Acquiror of
Privileged Communications relating to the Galleria Business pursuant to this
Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby will not be
asserted by Parent or Acquiror to constitute, or otherwise deemed, a waiver of
any Privilege that has been or may be asserted under this Section 5.14 or
otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement will operate to reduce, minimize or
condition the rights granted to Parent and Acquiror in, or the obligations
imposed upon Parent and Acquiror by, this Section 5.14.

5.15 Restriction on Hiring. (c) Parent agrees that for a period of 24 months
from the Closing Date, Parent will not, and will cause each other member of
the Parent Group not to, without obtaining the prior written consent of
Acquiror, directly or indirectly, employ any Continuing Employee (after giving
effect to any employee transfers contemplated in this Agreement); provided,
however, that any member of the Parent Group may hire any such Person if such
Person's employment has been terminated by the Acquiror Group for any reason
or such Person has been given notice of such termination, in either case,
prior to any direct or indirect solicitation by any member of the Parent Group
(other than solicitations by means of a general media advertisement).

(d) Acquiror agrees that for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date,
Acquiror will not, and will cause each other member of the Acquiror Group not
to, without obtaining the prior written consent of Parent, directly or
indirectly, employ any employee of Parent or any member of the Parent Group
who held a position with a seniority level of "Band 3" or higher (as such
employment bands are commonly referred to within Parent's organization as of
the date of this Agreement) and with whom Acquiror had direct contact through
face-to-face meetings or conference calls during the course of negotiating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (other
than as expressly contemplated by this Agreement with respect to employees of
the Galleria Business); provided, however, that any member of the Acquiror
Group may hire any such Person if such Person's employment has been terminated
by the Parent Group for any reason whatsoever or such Person has been given
notice of such termination, in either case, prior to any direct or indirect
solicitation by any member of the Acquiror Group (other than solicitations by
means of a general media advertisement).

(e) Parent agrees that for a period of 12 months from the Closing Date, Parent
will not, and will cause each other member of the Parent Group not to, without
obtaining the prior written consent of Acquiror, directly or indirectly,
employ any employee of Acquiror or any member of the Acquiror Group who held a
position with a seniority level of "Level F" or higher (as such employment
bands are commonly referred to within Acquiror's organization as of the date
of this Agreement) and with whom Parent had direct contact through face-to-
face meetings or conference calls during the course of negotiating the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;
provided, however, that any member of the Parent Group may hire any such
Person if such Person's employment has been terminated by the Acquiror Group
for any reason whatsoever or such Person has been given notice of such
termination, in either case, prior to any direct or indirect solicitation by
any member of the Parent Group (other than solicitations by means of a general
media advertisement).

5.16 Intellectual Property Assignment/Recordation. Each Party will be
responsible for, and will pay all expenses (whether incurred before or after
the Business Transfer Time) involved in notarization, authentication,
legalization or consularization of the signatures of any of the
representatives of its Group on any of the Transfer Documents relating to the
transfer of Intellectual Property. Acquiror will be responsible for, and will
pay, all expenses (whether incurred before or after the Business Transfer
Time) relating to, the recording of any such Transfer Documents relating to
the transfer of Intellectual Property from any member of the Parent Group to
any member of the Acquiror Group with any Governmental Authorities as may be
necessary or appropriate (other than expenses with respect to correcting or
updating information that, immediately prior to the Closing Date, is incorrect
or has not been updated with any Governmental Authorities concerning the
Registered Intellectual Property immediately prior to the Closing Date and
which is required to be corrected or updated in order to validly and
effectively transfer such Registered Intellectual Property from a member of
the Parent Group (other than any Galleria Group members) to a member of the
Galleria Group, which shall be corrected and paid for by Parent).

5.17 Use of Parent Names and Marks. (e) "Parent Names and Marks" means the
names and marks "PandG" and "Procter and Gamble"(in any style or design), and any
Trademark derived from, confusingly similar to or including any of the
foregoing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 5.17, Parent,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates as necessary, hereby grants to SplitCo
and the Galleria Entities a limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
(except to the extent licensed to third parties by the Parent Group in the
Galleria Business prior to the Closing), non-exclusive, royalty-free license,
for the six-month period following the Closing Date (the "Transition Period"),
to use the Parent Names and Marks in connection with the Galleria Business in
the manner set forth in Section 5.17(d). Acquiror and SplitCo will use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to transition from use of the Parent Names and
Marks as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event prior to expiration
of the Transition Period. Except as expressly provided in this Section 5.17 or
Section 5.27, Parent reserves for itself and its Affiliates all rights in the
Parent Names and Marks, and no other rights therein are granted to SplitCo,
any Galleria Entity, member of the Acquiror Group or any of their respective
Affiliates, whether by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All use of the
Parent Names and Marks by the Galleria Entities will inure to the benefit of
Parent and its Affiliates.

(f) As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event prior
to the expiration of the Transition Period, Acquiror will, and will cause the
other members of the Acquiror Group (including SplitCo and the Galleria
Entities) to, (i) change the name of any Galleria Entity whose name includes
any Parent Names and Marks to a name that does not include any of the Parent
Names and Marks, (ii) remove all publicly accessible references to Parent
Names and Marks from any internet or other electronic communications vehicles,
including internet domain names and from the content of any internet websites
within the Galleria Assets, and remove all links to any internet domains of
Parent or any of its Affiliates from any of the foregoing, (iii) remove or
irreversibly cover or modify all Parent Names and Marks from or destroy any
packaging bearing any of the Parent Names and Marks, except that SplitCo and
the Galleria Entities may continue to sell inventories of finished goods
existing or in-process as of the Closing Date and included in the Galleria
Assets until the expiration of the applicable shelf lives of such products;
provided, however, that Acquiror and its Affiliates use their Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to sell such existing inventories prior to the sale of
subsequently manufactured or packaged products, and (iv) remove or
irreversibly cover or modify all Parent Names and Marks from or destroy any
product literature, store displays and similar publicly accessible materials
bearing any of the Parent Names and Marks.

(g) For all other uses of the Parent Names and Marks not specifically
identified in Section 5.17(b) (e.g., signage, business cards and stationery),
for up to 90 days after the Closing Date, in each applicable jurisdiction,
SplitCo and the Galleria Entities may continue to use the Parent Names and
Marks on the same materials and in substantially the same manner as used by
the Galleria Business during the 90-day period preceding the Closing. In each
applicable jurisdiction, as soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
and, in any event within 90 days after the Closing Date, Acquiror will, and
will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to, remove or irreversibly
cover or modify all Parent Names and Marks from or destroy any such other
publicly accessible materials bearing any of the Parent Names and Marks.

(h) In no event will SplitCo or any of the Galleria Entities use, and Acquiror
will, and will cause the other members of the Acquiror Group to not use, any
of the Parent Names and Marks that are subject to the license under this
Section 5.17 after the Closing in any manner or for any purpose other than in
the same or substantially same manner that such Parent Names and Marks were
being used by the Galleria Business during the 12-month period preceding the
Closing. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, all
products sold by the Galleria Business using any Parent Name or Mark will be
of high quality, consistent in nature and quality with such products as sold
by the Galleria Business in the 12-month period preceding Closing. Parent
reserves the right to reasonably inspect the Galleria Business' quality
control of the products sold bearing and uses of a Parent Name or Mark and
other compliance with the terms of the license granted under this Section
5.17, in each of the foregoing cases, upon reasonable prior written notice to
Acquiror and during normal business hours.

(i) The license granted under this Section 5.17 may be terminated by written
notice if Acquiror, SplitCo or any Galleria Entity is in material breach of
any provision hereof that remains uncured for more than ten days after written
notice thereof from Parent, provided that such termination shall not be
effective if Acquiror, SplitCo or the Galleria Entity, as applicable, is using
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cure or otherwise remedy such breach. Upon
such termination of the license granted hereunder for any reason, Acquiror and
its Affiliates will not use any of the Parent Names and Marks hereunder.

(j) For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Section 5.17 shall preclude any
uses of the Parent Names and Marks that are required or otherwise not
prohibited under applicable Law (e.g., fair use).

5.18 Removal of Tangible Assets. (a) Prior to the Business Transfer Time, the
Parties will discuss in good faith the process and timing for moving to a
Galleria Facility all tangible Galleria Assets that are located at any
facilities of any member of the Parent Group that are not Galleria Facilities
and are reasonably able to be moved, including the feasibility of moving such
Galleria Assets prior to the Business Transfer Time. Following such
discussions, Parent will determine whether such Galleria Assets should be
moved prior to or at the Business Transfer Time, and Parent will cause such
Galleria Assets to be moved at the applicable time from such facilities to a
Galleria Facility (except, in the case of any Galleria Assets that are
utilized by Parent in connection with the performance of a service under the
Transition Services Agreement, which will be removed as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the termination of such service and in accordance with
the Transition Services Agreement). Any move of Galleria Assets pursuant to
this Section 5.18, whether prior to or after the Business Transfer Time, will
be in a manner so as not to cause substantial damage to such Galleria Assets;
provided, that Acquiror will be responsible for the installation of such
property within SplitCo's facilities.

(b) Except as may be otherwise provided in the Transition Services Agreement
or otherwise agreed to by the Parties, all tangible Excluded Assets (if any)
that are located at any of the Galleria Facilities will be removed from such
facilities prior to the Closing, at Parent's expense and in a manner so as not
to unreasonably interfere with the operations of any member of the Acquiror
Group and to not cause substantial damage to such Galleria Facility; provided,
that Parent will remove any Excluded Assets that remain at any such Galleria
Facilities in connection with the performance of services under the Transition
Services Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable after the termination
of such service pursuant to the same terms and conditions stated above in this
Section 5.18(b).

5.19 Works Council Cooperation. To the extent required by applicable Law or
labor agreement or any agreement with employee representatives, in each case
in connection with the transfer of the In-Scope Employees to employment with
SplitCo and its Subsidiaries and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
Parent will, or will cause one of its Subsidiaries to, make any notifications
to, and consultations with, works councils, economic committees, unions or
similar bodies with respect to the In-Scope Employees. Parent and Acquiror
will each provide, and will cause each of their Subsidiaries to provide, and
will use their reasonable best efforts to cause each of their respective
representatives, including legal, human resources and regulatory, to provide,
all cooperation reasonably requested by the other Party in connection with
satisfying its obligations with respect to any works council, economic
committee, union or similar body, including all notifications and
consultations and other processes (including meetings with any such body)
necessary to effectuate the transfer of the In-Scope Employees to employment
with SplitCo and its Subsidiaries at the Business Transfer Time and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, which will include any required
notifications and consultations and other processes required to either (a)
obtain an opinion or acknowledgment from any works council, economic
committee, union or similar body or (b) establish that the Parties are
permitted to effect the transactions contemplated hereby without such opinion
or acknowledgment. Such cooperation will include the provision of any
information and consultation required by applicable Law, the terms of any
Contract or as reasonably requested by the other Party. Each of Acquiror and
Parent will make available its representatives at such times and in such
places as the other Party may reasonably request for purposes of discussions
with representatives of any such works council, economic committee, union or
similar body. Parent and its Subsidiaries will promptly notify Acquiror (and
provide copies) of any binding commitments or final agreements with any works
council, economic committee, union or similar body in the information and/or
consultation or other procedures with respect to the In-Scope Employees in
respect of the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and its Subsidiaries
will not make any binding commitment or final agreement with any such works
council, economic committee, union or similar body (or in each case, to any
representatives thereof) for which the Acquiror Group may be liable after the
Closing, without the written consent of Acquiror, which will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

5.20 Insurance Matters. From and after the Closing, Acquiror will not, and
will cause its Affiliates not to, assert any claim against any insurance
policies or practices of Parent and its Affiliates under any captive insurance
policies, fronted insurance policies, surety bonds or corporate insurance
policies or practices, or any form of self-insurance whatsoever; provided,
however, that (a) Parent and Acquiror agree that all claims with respect to
insured events occurring prior to the Closing will be administered in
accordance with the terms of Parent's or its Subsidiaries' third-party
policies, if any, and coverage applicable to such claims, (b) Acquiror will
receive the benefit of such third-party policies with respect to such claims
to the extent losses occurring prior to the Closing related to Galleria Assets
are covered notwithstanding the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (c) Parent will receive the benefit of such policies
with respect to such claims to the extent losses related to Liabilities other
than Galleria Liabilities are covered notwithstanding the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and provided that in the case of
clauses (b) and (c) such recovery will be net of any deductibles or self-
insured retention amounts, costs of any retroactive insurance premiums or
other amounts paid or expenses incurred in connection with any insured claims
made after the Closing under any such policies that relate to the period prior
to Closing or any amounts paid by Parent pursuant to Article IX in respect of
the applicable Liabilities (it being understood that Parent will have the
right to determine whether or not to make any claim against Parent's insurance
policies).

5.21 Restructuring of Galleria Business; Transition Plan. (a) Transition Plan.
During the 90-day period immediately following the date of this Agreement,
Parent and Acquiror will develop a plan as provided in this Section 5.21 (as
the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Transition
Plan") that sets forth reasonable detail regarding (i) the establishment prior
to the Closing of such internal functions of SplitCo as may be necessary so as
to allow Acquiror to operate SplitCo immediately after the Closing in a
commercially reasonable manner in all material respects (which may take into
account the functions that will be provided by Acquiror's existing business
and resources and also the transition services that are referenced in Exhibit
D or otherwise permitted by clause (ii) of this sentence), and (ii)
preparation for the receipt of the transition services referenced in Exhibit
D; provided, however, that Acquiror may reasonably request other services if
such services are not expressly listed as "Excluded" on Exhibit D, but Exhibit
D shall be amended solely to the extent that Parent determines, in its sole
discretion, such amendment would not materially increase the likelihood that
the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would not apply to the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(b) Preparation of Transition Plan. Parent and Acquiror will provide to each
other no later than 5 days after the date of this Agreement the names of their
transition team leaders. Within 30 days of the date of this Agreement, Parent
will prepare a draft Transition Plan and present such plan to Acquiror (the
"Original Proposal"). The Parties will discuss in good faith during the 30 day
period following the delivery of the Original Proposal to Acquiror any desired
changes to the Original Proposal; provided, that no such proposed amendment
will result in an increase by more than a de minimis amount in the nature and
scope of the services ultimately provided by Parent to SplitCo pursuant to the
transition services described in Exhibit D, as such may be amended from time
to time in accordance with Section 5.21(a). In the event of any disagreement
with respect to the preparation of the Transition Plan that continues to be
unresolved at the end of this second 30 day period, each of Parent and
Acquiror will refer such disagreement to an executive officer of Parent and
Acquiror (as applicable), which executive officers will negotiate in good
faith to resolve such disagreement within 30 days. In the event that such
negotiations are unable to resolve such disagreement, then the Transition Plan
will be completed as proposed by Parent (after taking into account any points
of agreement between Parent and Acquiror), provided, that the Transition Plan
must be commercially reasonable, consistent with the Intended Tax-Free
Treatment and reasonably capable of completion by the End Date.

(c) Proposed Changes After Transition Plan Is Finalized. After the Transition
Plan is completed as contemplated by Section 5.21(b), either Parent or
Acquiror can propose amendments to such Transition Plan. The adoption of such
amendments will be subject to the consent of the other Party after good faith
consideration, taking into account the impacts of such a change on the
Intended Tax-Free Treatment and the ability to complete the Closing by the End
Date; provided, however, that no such proposed amendment will result in an
increase by more than a de minimis amount in the nature and scope of the
services ultimately provided by Parent to SplitCo pursuant to the transition
services described in Exhibit D, as such may be amended from time to time in
accordance with Section 5.21(a).

(d) Execution of Transition Plan. Parent will, and will cause the other
members of the Parent Group to, commence implementation of the Transition Plan
promptly after the Transition Plan is finalized as contemplated by Section
5.21(b), and will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to complete the
Transition Plan no later than the Business Transfer Time. Parent will provide
Acquiror with monthly reports on the progress of implementation of the
Transition Plan and expenditures in connection therewith, together with
reasonable detail regarding such expenditures. In the event that an action
proposed to be taken by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the Restructuring would be permitted or prohibited pursuant to Section 5.01
but would conflict with a provision of the Transition Plan, the Transition
Plan will control.

(e) Transfer of Accounts Receivable. Prior to the Cut-Off Date and prior to
the Closing, Parent will cause (i) all accounts receivable that are either (A)
primarily related to the Galleria Business and held by SplitCo or any Galleria
Entity or (B) primarily related to the Salon Professional Business and (ii)
all other rights to payment and security for payments to the extent they
relate to the Galleria Business to be held by a member of the Galleria Group.

(f) Set-Up of UPC/EAN Codes; Packaging; Transition of Parent Names and Marks.
In connection with the Restructuring and implementation of the Transition
Plan, Parent will commence, prior to the Closing, Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to (i) establish UPC, EAN and similar codes for the Galleria Entities
insofar as such entities do not currently have their own such codes, (ii)
modify the packaging and related written materials of the Galleria Business
used to advertise, promote, market and sell its products so as to remove any
Parent Names and Marks that appear on such packaging and materials, (iii)
commence the changes contemplated in Section 5.17 prior to the Closing, all of
the foregoing in reasonable consultation and cooperation with Acquiror (it
being understood that the activities referenced in this Section
5.21(f)(i)-(iii) may not be completed as of the Closing, in which case, in
addition to use of the Parent Names and Marks permitted pursuant to Section
5.17, the Galleria Entities will be permitted to use the UPC, EAN and similar
codes of the Parent Group for a reasonable period of time following the
Closing) and (iv) establish for the Galleria Entities an accumulation of
inventory of all Products incorporating or manufactured using any of the
Excluded Technologies set forth on Section 5.21(f) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter that will not be licensed (other than pursuant to a sell-off license)
to SplitCo following the Closing, which accumulation is sufficient to meet
sales of such Products from the Closing through the 2016 holiday season, as
measured by the average sales of such Products during the corresponding period
in the three (3) years prior to Closing. To the extent that any inventory
build-up contemplated by such clause (iv) would take place between the Cut-Off
Date and the Closing Date, the Cut-Off Date Working Capital will include
Parent's good faith projection of the amount of such inventory that would be
present as of the Closing Date.

(g) Control of Galleria Entity Structuring. Authorized representatives of
Parent and Acquiror will use their reasonable best efforts to meet, within 30
days and then again within 60 days after the date hereof, to discuss (i) the
material Galleria Assets that are held and the material Galleria Liabilities
that are owed, as of such date, by Parent or any of its Affiliates and that
will be held by, transferred to or assumed by, as the case may be, a Galleria
Entity prior to the Closing, and (ii) any Tax or other objectives that
Acquiror desires that Parent take into account in effecting the Galleria
Transfer (the "Acquiror Restructuring Goals"). Parent will use its reasonable
best efforts to provide Acquiror, not more than 90 days after the date hereof,
with schedules identifying or describing any (1) Galleria Assets that are
held, and Galleria Liabilities that are owed, as of such date by Parent or any
of its Affiliates and that will be held by, transferred to or assumed by, as
the case may be, a Galleria Entity prior to the Closing and (2) any Excluded
Assets that are held, and Retained Liabilities that are owed, as of such date
by the Galleria Entities and that will be transferred to or assumed by, as the
case may be, Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than a Galleria Entity)
prior to the Closing (the schedules described in clause (1) and clause (2)
immediately above, collectively, the "Restructuring Schedules"). Within 15
days after receipt of the Restructuring Schedules, Acquiror will notify Parent
in writing of any revisions to the Acquiror Restructuring Goals, and Parent
will, after giving good faith consideration to the Acquiror Restructuring
Goals as revised herein, (x) preliminarily determine, in its sole discretion,
the manner in which each Galleria Asset and Galleria Liability is Conveyed to
SplitCo or any of its Subsidiaries, including whether a particular Galleria
Asset is contributed or Galleria Liability is Conveyed directly to SplitCo or
another member of the Galleria Group or is included as an asset or liability
of an entity whose equity interests are contributed to SplitCo (collectively,
the "Galleria Entity Structuring"), and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to
provide Acquiror, within 45 days after receipt of Acquiror's written
notification regarding any revisions to the Acquiror Restructuring Goals, with
a reasonably detailed step plan illustrating the steps pursuant to which
Parent believes as of such date that Parent will implement the Galleria Entity
Structuring (such step plan, the "Galleria Entity Structuring Step Plan").
Within 30 days after receipt of the Galleria Entity Structuring Step Plan,
Acquiror will notify Parent in writing of any comments to such plan. Parent
will: (i) consult with Acquiror in good faith regarding Acquiror's written
comments to the Galleria Entity Structuring Step Plan, (ii) provide Acquiror
with an opportunity to review any contemplated revisions to the Galleria
Entity Structuring Step Plan; (iii) in its sole discretion, finalize the
Galleria Entity Structuring and (iv) promptly provide a copy of the final
Galleria Entity Structuring Step Plan to Acquiror.

(h) Transition Services Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable after
determination of the Transition Plan, the Parties will negotiate in good faith
the schedule of services for the Transition Services Agreement to be entered
into by and between Parent and SplitCo at the Closing, for the provision of
the services and access contemplated by the Transition Services Agreement,
Section 5.21(a) and Exhibit D for a term of six months following the Closing
Date, plus any extension of such term expressly permitted under the Transition
Services Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of Parent or any of its Affiliates will make any substantive
business decisions with respect to the Galleria Business in performing any
services for SplitCo pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

(i) Restructuring Documentation. Parent will provide any proposed agreements,
certificates of formation or other governing documents, instruments of
conveyance and other similar documents relating to the Restructuring
(collectively, the "Restructuring Documents") to Acquiror for its review a
reasonable amount of time prior to execution of each such Restructuring
Document (or, if not executed, prior to the effectiveness of each such
Restructuring Document). Parent will, in good faith, consider any reasonable
request by Acquiror in such Restructuring Documents, provided that, to the
extent Acquiror has not informed Parent of any requested changes within five
Business Days of its receipt of any Restructuring Document, such Restructuring
Document will be deemed to be satisfactory. All Restructuring Documents will
be consistent with the terms of the Agreement and will not impose any
additional Liabilities or obligations on SplitCo, Acquiror or any other party
beyond those contemplated in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to permit Acquiror to control or
direct any aspect of the Galleria Entity Structuring, which will be determined
by Parent as provided in Section 5.21(g).

5.22 Confidentiality. (a) The Parties acknowledge that in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, the Parties have disclosed to each other
Information which the Parties consider proprietary and confidential
("Confidential Information"). For the avoidance of doubt, any information
disclosed by or on behalf of the Parties under the Confidentiality Agreement
that is subject to the confidentiality obligations contained therein will be,
and will be deemed to be, Confidential Information for purposes of this
Agreement and will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the restrictions on the disclosure of such Confidential
Information contained herein. The Parties agree that, after the Closing,
Information that constitutes an Galleria Asset will be Confidential
Information of Acquiror and Acquiror will not be subject to this Section 5.22
(except for Section 5.22(c)) with respect to such information, and Parent will
be deemed to be the Receiving Party of such Confidential Information for
purposes of Section 5.22(b).

(b) Each Party receiving Confidential Information (the "Receiving Party")
recognizes and acknowledges:

(iii) that Confidential Information of the other Party may be commercially
valuable proprietary products of such Party, the design and development of
which may have involved the expenditure of substantial amounts of money and
the use of skilled development experts over a long period of time and which
afford such Party a commercial advantage over its competitors;

(iv) that the loss of this competitive advantage due to unauthorized
disclosure or use of Confidential Information of such Party may cause great
injury and harm to such Party; and

(v) that the restrictions imposed upon the Parties under this Section 5.22 are
necessary to protect the secrecy of Confidential Information and to prevent
the occurrence of such injury and harm. The Parties agree that:

(A) disclosure of Confidential Information will be received and held in
confidence by the Receiving Party and that such Receiving Party will not,
without the prior written consent of the Party from whom such Confidential
Information was obtained (the "Disclosing Party"), disclose, divulge or permit
any Person to obtain any Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing
Party (whether or not such Confidential Information is in written or tangible
form), other than to Subsidiaries of the Receiving Party and their employees
and agents, in each case, who have a need to know such Confidential
Information and who are bound in writing by duties of confidentiality and non-
use obligations with respect to such Confidential Information no less
protective of the Disclosing Party than those set forth herein;

(B) the Receiving Party will take such steps as may be reasonably necessary to
prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information to others; and

(C) the Receiving Party will use the Information only in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby to perform its and its Group's obligations,
or to exercise its rights, under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(c) The commitments set forth above will not extend to any portion of
Confidential Information:

(i) which is already known to the Receiving Party other than any member of
Parent Group with respect to Confidential Information related to the Galleria
Business or any of the Galleria Entities, or is information generally
available to the public;

(ii) which, hereafter, through no act on the part of the Receiving Party or
its Representatives becomes generally available to the public;

(iii) which corresponds in substance to a disclosure furnished to the
Receiving Party by any third party having a bona fide right to do so and not
having any confidential obligation, direct or indirect, to the Disclosing
Party with respect to the same; or

(iv) which is required to be disclosed by Law; provided that the Receiving
Party provides reasonable prior written notice of such required disclosure to
the Disclosing Party following the Receiving Party's knowledge of such
requirement in order to provide the Disclosing Party with an opportunity to
prevent or limit such disclosure by seeking a protective order or other
appropriate remedy at the sole expense of the Disclosing Party.

5.23 Certain Material Contracts. (a) Parent has not, prior to the execution of
this Agreement, made available to Acquiror copies or summaries of certain
Galleria Material Contracts or Shared Business Contracts required to be listed
or described in Section 3.08(a) or Section 3.08(b) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter (the "To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contracts"). Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, but subject to Parent's compliance with
the provisions of this Section 5.23, Parent's failure to identify or make the
To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contracts available to Acquiror does not
constitute a breach of Sections 3.08(a), 3.08(b) or 3.08(d). Nothing in this
Section 5.23 will be deemed to limit or otherwise alter Parent's obligations,
to the extent of Parent's Knowledge, to list all of the Galleria Material
Contracts on Section 3.08 of the Parent Disclosure Letter on the date hereof
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Parent will use reasonable best efforts to furnish a true, complete and
correct copy (or summary of the material terms) of each To-Be-Delivered
Galleria Material Contract (other than any To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material
Contract the terms or existence of which is confidential) existing as of the
date of this Agreement to Acquiror as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof and, in any event, within 60 days following the date hereof.

(c) If any To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contract constitutes a Galleria
Material Contract of the type referred to in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii),
(vi), (xi), (xii) or (xiii) of Section 3.08(a) (other than (1) distribution
agreements that were identified or described on Section 3.08 of the Parent
Disclosure Letter that meet such description solely because they contain an
exclusivity provision in respect of a material service and therefore fall
within clause (i) or (ii) of Section 3.08(a) and (2) any To-Be-Delivered
Galleria Material Contract the terms or existence of which is confidential),
then Acquiror will have the right to notify Parent within 30 days after the
delivery of each such Contract (or description of the material terms of such
Contract) that it elects not to assume such To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material
Contract. With respect to any To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contract a
copy (or description of material terms) of which is not delivered to Acquiror
within the 60-day period referenced in sub-paragraph (b), this 30-day election
period will commence at the end of such 60-day period.

(d) Any To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contracts that Acquiror elects not
to assume as provided above, together with, unless otherwise agreed by
Acquiror, any To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contracts (other than any To-
Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contract the terms or existence of which is
confidential) that are not delivered to Acquiror in accordance with Section
5.23(b) will not constitute Galleria Contracts hereunder and will not be
Conveyed to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates pursuant hereto. Subject to the
other provisions of this Agreement, all other To-Be-Delivered Galleria
Material Contracts (including any To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contract
the terms or existence of which is confidential) will constitute Galleria
Contracts hereunder and will be Conveyed to Acquiror or its Affiliates in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that Acquiror
will not decline to assume any such To-Be-Delivered Galleria Material Contract
if Parent determines, in its sole discretion, that doing so would materially
increase the likelihood that the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would not apply
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.24 Mercury Business Perfume Oils. (a) With respect to the Exclusive Third-
Party Perfume Oils, in addition to its obligations under Section 1.08(b),
Parent hereby agrees to waive (which waiver will be effective at the Business
Transfer Time) any exclusivity provision in Parent's supply agreements with
the relevant Existing Perfume Oil Suppliers that is necessary to allow SplitCo
to attempt to negotiate its own independent relationship with such Existing
Perfume Oil Supplier who can, subject to SplitCo reaching a mutually agreeable
arrangement with such Existing Perfume Oil Suppliers, supply the Exclusive
Third-Party Perfume Oils directly to SplitCo on an exclusive basis.

(b) At the Business Transfer Time, Parent will provide SplitCo with the
formula cards relating to the Exclusive Parent Perfume Oils and SplitCo will
be entitled to use such formula cards without further compensation. In
addition to its obligations under Section 1.08(b), Parent hereby agrees to
waive (which waiver will be effective at the Business Transfer Time) any
exclusivity provision in Parent's supply agreements with any applicable
supplier that supplies the ingredients required to produce the Exclusive
Parent Perfume Oils to the extent necessary to allow SplitCo to attempt to
negotiate its own independent relationship with such suppliers.

(c) Following the Business Transfer Time, the Parent Group shall not (i) use
the Exclusive Parent Perfume Oils or the Exclusive Third-Party Perfume Oils or
(ii) until the fifth anniversary of the Closing, and without limitation to any
Intellectual Property rights of the Galleria Group, intentionally replicate
the scent thereof (excluding in each case, for the avoidance of doubt, any
such Perfume Oils that are used in a Retained Business).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SplitCo will
not receive access to any Perfume Oils that are exclusively related to any
Retained Business.

5.25 Ancillary Fragrances. (a) With respect to the Exclusive Third-Party
Ancillary Fragrances, in addition to its obligations under Section 1.08(b),
Parent hereby agrees to waive (which waiver will be effective as of the
Business Transfer Date) any exclusivity provision in the Parent Group's supply
agreements with the relevant Existing Ancillary Fragrance Suppliers that is
necessary to allow SplitCo to attempt to negotiate its own independent
relationship with such Existing Ancillary Fragrance Suppliers that can,
subject to SplitCo reaching a mutually agreeable arrangement with such
Existing Ancillary Fragrance Suppliers, supply the Exclusive Third-Party
Ancillary Fragrances directly to SplitCo on an exclusive basis for use by
SplitCo in products marketed under the same primary brand name as the Non-
Mercury Products or Non-Hydroalcoholic Products that use the applicable
Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary Fragrances as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) With respect to the Non-Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary Fragrances, in
addition to its obligations under Section 1.08(b), Parent hereby agrees to
waive (which waiver will be effective as of the Business Transfer Date) any
exclusivity provision in the Parent Group's supply agreements with the
relevant Existing Ancillary Fragrance Suppliers that is necessary to allow
SplitCo to attempt to negotiate its own independent relationship with such
Existing Ancillary Fragrance Supplier that can, subject to SplitCo reaching a
mutually agreeable arrangement with such Existing Ancillary Fragrance
Supplier, supply the Non-Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary Fragrances directly
to SplitCo on a non-exclusive basis for use by SplitCo in products marketed
under the same primary brand name as the applicable Non-Mercury Products or
Non-Hydroalcoholic Products that use the Non-Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary
Fragrances as of the date of this Agreement.

(c) At the Business Transfer Time, Parent will provide SplitCo with the
formula cards relating to the Exclusive Parent Ancillary Fragrances and
SplitCo will be entitled to use such formula cards without further
compensation, and Parent will destroy any copies in its possession of such
formula cards. At the Business Transfer Time, Parent will provide SplitCo with
the formula cards relating to the Non-Exclusive Parent Ancillary Fragrances
and SplitCo will be entitled to use such formula cards without further
compensation, and Parent and SplitCo will each maintain the confidentiality of
such formula cards.

(d) Acquiror acknowledges and agrees that (i) SplitCo's right to use the Non-
Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary Fragrances is non-exclusive, (ii) after the
Business Transfer Time, Parent and Parent's Affiliates may use the Non-
Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary Fragrances and Non-Exclusive Parent Ancillary
Fragrances in their current or future products under other brand names in
their other businesses or sell, assign, transfer, deliver, license or
otherwise permit the use of the Non-Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary Fragrances
or the Non-Exclusive Parent Ancillary Fragrances by Third Parties in other
products, and (iii) after the Business Transfer Time, Parent and Parent's
Affiliates may develop new fragrances with characteristics similar to the Non-
Hydroalcoholic Fragrances in their other businesses.

(e) Following the Business Transfer Time, the Parent Group shall not use the
Exclusive Parent Ancillary Fragrances or Exclusive Third-Party Ancillary
Fragrances (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such Ancillary
Fragrances that are used in a Retained Business).

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, SplitCo will
not receive access to any Non-Hydroalcoholic Fragrances that are exclusively
related to any Retained Business.

5.26 Continuing Employee Restrictions. Without the prior written consent of
Parent, and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, during the 12-month
period following the Closing Date, the Acquiror Group will not permit any
Continuing Employee to, and will cause each Continuing Employee not to,
directly or indirectly, engage in any activity with, or provide any services
to, including as a director, manager, supervisor, employee, advisor,
consultant or otherwise, any member of the Acquiror Group in connection with
the manufacture, development, advertising, promotion or sale of any product
which is the same as or similar to or competitive with any product of Parent
and its Affiliates (including any existing product as well as any product
known to the Continuing Employee, as a consequence of the Continuing
Employee's employment with Parent or its Affiliates, to be in development)
that is manufactured, marketed or sold in the Retail Channel during such
12-month period, other than products manufactured, marketed or sold by the
Galleria Business outside of the Retail Channel and otherwise to the extent
not restricted by the terms of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document.

5.27 Facilities Split Plan. Following the date hereof, Parent and Acquiror
will develop a plan in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in
the Split Plan Agreement to separate the Split Facilities from their existing
combined sites so that the Split Facilities can be transferred as herein
contemplated. Parent and Acquiror will bear the costs of implementation of the
Split Plan equally; provided, however, that (a) prior to the Closing, Parent
may, in good faith, update any estimates of the costs and expenses reasonably
expected to be incurred by each of the Parties to separate the Split
Facilities as contemplated by this Section 5.27 (such amounts, the "Split Plan
Costs"), (b) prior to the Closing, the Recapitalization Amount will be
increased or decreased, as applicable, by the net amount of any adjustments
necessary to achieve a 50%/50% sharing of the Split Plan Costs (taking into
account any updated estimates as contemplated by the preceding clause (a)),
and (c) no reimbursement payments will be made by one Party to the other in
respect of Split Plan Costs after the Closing.

5.28 Wind-down of Max Factor Gold Business. Between the date hereof and the
Closing Date, the Parent Group will wind-down its Max Factor Gold business and
will cease production of any new Max Factor Gold business products under the
Trademark contained in the Galleria IP Assets and used in connection with the
Kosmos Business by the Closing Date.

5.29 Diamond Technology. From the date hereof until the Business Transfer
Time, Parent will dedicate the equivalent of three full-time employees to
attempt to develop a replacement or substitute Technology for the Diamond
Technology, for purposes of securing a replacement or substitute that is
substantially similar or superior to the Diamond Technology for use in Care
Products (the "Substitute Diamond Technology").

5.30 Non-Compete Restrictions. (a) Parent Group General Restrictions. For the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Parent will not, and will cause
its Affiliates not to, without the prior consent of Acquiror, directly or
indirectly (it being understood that in respect of Covered Salon Products,
indirect sales will be prohibited only insofar as they take place at the
direction of a member of the Parent Group through an agent of any member of
the Parent Group) engage in, anywhere in the world, the sourcing,
manufacturing, development, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution or
marketing of: (a) Color Products; (b) Covered Salon Products; (c) Covered Fine
Fragrance Products; or (d) Covered Color Cosmetics Products (collectively, the
"Restricted Business"); provided, however, that the foregoing will not
restrict Parent or its Affiliates from: (i) owning, directly or indirectly,
solely as an investment, securities of any Person engaged in a Restricted
Business if neither Parent, nor any of its controlled Affiliates, beneficially
own (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) more than 10% of any
class of securities of such Person; (ii) making any acquisition of any
business or Person that engages in a Restricted Business (the "Target"), if
the annual net sales attributable to the Restricted Business for the Target's
most recent fiscal year constitute less than 30% of the total net sales of the
Target for such year, provided, however, that if such net sales of the
Restricted Business for the Target's most recent fiscal year exceed $200
million and the closing of the acquisition of the Target occurs more than 12
months prior to the end of the Restricted Period, then Parent will (x) provide
Acquiror the right to make a proposal to purchase such Retained Business
within 60 days following Parent providing notice to Acquiror of such closing,
and, if Acquiror makes such a proposal, to negotiate the terms of such a
purchase in good faith for the remainder of such 60 day period and (y) in the
event Acquiror declines to make such a proposal (or if Parent and Acquiror do
not enter into an agreement with respect to the sale of such Retained Business
within such 60 day period or agree to extend such period), use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to sell or otherwise dispose of the portion of the Target's
business that engages in the Restricted Business and Parent will be required
to either sell or cease to operate the portion of the Target's business that
engages in the Restricted Business as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within 18 months of the closing of the acquisition of the Target; (iii)
licensing any Patents or Trade Secrets that are applicable to the other
businesses owned by the Parent Group to any Person (even if such Person owns a
Restricted Business) so long as, subject to the limitations set forth in
Schedule 5.30(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, any license of such Patents
or Trade Secrets to such Person does not permit such Person to use or
sublicense such Patents or Trade Secrets in such Restricted Business and
Parent will (and will cause its Affiliates to) use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to enforce such restrictions; or (iv) providing any transitional
services or supply to any Person arising from the divestiture of one or more
of Parent's businesses. The parties agree that the covenants included in this
Section 5.30(a) are, taken as a whole, reasonable in their geographic and
temporal coverage and no party will raise any issue of geographic or temporal
reasonableness in any proceeding to enforce such covenant. Parent acknowledges
and agrees that in the event of a breach by Parent of the provisions of this
Section 5.30(a), monetary damages will not constitute a sufficient remedy.
Consequently, in the event of any such breach, Acquiror may, in addition to
any other rights and remedies existing in its favor, apply to any court of law
or equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive
relief or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any violation of the
provisions hereof.

(b) Exceptions. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, Section 5.30(a)
will not prohibit, restrict or prevent any of the following:

(i) the operation of the Existing Parent Business;

(ii) the operation of the Restricted Business by Parent to the extent such
Restricted Business is permitted to be retained by Parent pursuant to Section
5.30(a)(ii) or Section 5.30(a)(iii), as applicable;

(iii) the sourcing, manufacturing, development, advertising, promotion, sale,
distribution or marketing of any products that are included in the categories
specified on Section 5.30(b)(iii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter (such
products, collectively, the "Parent Out-of-Scope Products"); or

(iv) subject to Section 1.09, the continuation, operation, development,
transfer or transition of the Retained Business.

VI. EMPLOYEE MATTERS

6.01 Identification of Employees. (j) Parent will update the lists of In-Scope
Employees set forth on Section 6.01 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (i) within
20 days following the date of this Agreement, (ii) from time to time
thereafter in Parent's sole discretion and (iii) no later than ten days prior
to the Closing Date, in each case, in order to reflect terminations,
allocation of Parent Group employees at the Split Facilities, transfers, new
hires, changes in active status, changes to Choice Employee status, accidental
or inadvertent errors or omissions and changes resulting from the
implementation of the Restructuring and the implementation of the Transition
Plan and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, highlighting
such changes. Subject to applicable Laws, including following Parent's receipt
of a valid waiver or consent from the applicable employee where applicable Law
requires, Parent will also include the names of In-Scope Employees who hold a
position with a seniority level of "Band 3" or higher (as such employment
bands are commonly referred to within Parent's organization as of the date of
this Agreement) in its updates to the lists of In-Scope Employees set forth on
Section 6.01 of the Parent Disclosure Letter. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent may, in its sole discretion, cause the
employment of any In-Scope Employee to be transferred to any member of the
Galleria Group at any time prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, and to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall cause the employment of any employee
of any member of the Galleria Group (other than any In-Scope Employee) to be
transferred to any member of the Parent Group (other than any member of the
Galleria Group) at any time prior to the Closing.

(k) Within 45 days following the date of this Agreement, Parent will provide
to Acquiror a true and complete list, on an In-Scope Employee by In-Scope
Employee basis, of all equity and equity based awards of Parent (collectively,
the "Parent Awards") held by each In-Scope Employee with an employment level
of "Band 4" or higher (as such employment bands are commonly referred to
within Parent's organization) as of the date of this Agreement, and such list
will also provide the dates of grant, expiration date, the number of shares
underlying such Parent Awards, and the applicable exercise or base price per
share.

(l) Within 45 days following the date of this Agreement, Parent will provide
to Acquiror a list indicating the visa or similar work authorization status of
each Expatriate Employee working pursuant to such a local visa or similar
authorization as of the date of this Agreement.

(m) Within 60 days following the date of this Agreement, Parent will provide
to Acquiror a true and complete list of each material Compensation and Benefit
Plan. Within 60 days following the date of this Agreement, Parent will make
available to Acquiror a true and complete copy of Parent's expatriate policy
and with respect to each Galleria Business Acquired Plan, Parent will make
available to Acquiror copies of (i) the plan document, including any
amendments thereto, (ii) if applicable, the most recent annual report on Form
5500 required to be filed with the IRS or any comparable report required to be
filed with a Governmental Authority, (iii) the most recent actuarial valuation
report, if applicable, for the applicable plan and (iv) if applicable, the
most recent IRS determination letter or any comparable letter from a
Governmental Authority regarding the tax-qualified status of any such plan
with a tax-qualified trust if assets will be transferred from such trust to a
trust of a Galleria Group Plan pursuant to Schedule 1.05(a)(xiii).

6.02 Continuity of Employment. (g) Parent and Acquiror hereby acknowledge that
it is in their mutual best interest for there to be continuity of employment
by the Galleria Group following the Closing with respect to (i) each In-Scope
Employee (other than any Choice Employee) and (ii) each Choice Employee who
agrees to continue employment with the Galleria Group as of the Closing (in
each case, other than any employee whose employment with Parent and its
Subsidiaries terminated prior to the Closing) (collectively, "Galleria
Business Employees").

(h) As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event prior to the Closing
Date (or such time as is required by applicable Law or as is required in
connection with notifications to, or consultations with, unions or works
councils), (i) SplitCo will, or will cause one of its Subsidiaries to, make an
offer of employment to each In-Scope Employee unless such In-Scope Employee is
employed by a Galleria Entity or such In-Scope Employee's employment will
otherwise transfer to the Galleria Group pursuant to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or applicable Law and (ii) SplitCo will, or
will cause one of its Subsidiaries to, present its terms and conditions of
employment (including base salary, target bonus opportunity and other terms
and conditions in respect of post-Closing compensation and benefits) to all
In-Scope Employees (regardless of whether described in clause (i) of this
sentence), which employee offers and terms and conditions will be consistent
with the provisions of Section 6.04. Prior to making such offers and
presenting such terms and conditions, SplitCo will provide Parent and Acquiror
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on its proposed terms and
conditions. Subject to applicable Law, Parent, SplitCo and Acquiror will
reasonably cooperate in connection with the presentation of such employment
offers and terms and conditions of employment to the In-Scope Employees,
including with respect to the timing thereof. The Parties acknowledge that any
In-Scope Employee (including any Choice Employee) may elect not to continue
employment with the Galleria Group. Each Galleria Business Employee who
continues employment or accepts employment with a member of the Galleria Group
(the applicable entity, the "Employing Entity") immediately following the
Closing is referred to herein as a "Continuing Employee". Each Continuing
Employee whose home country is in the United States is referred to as a "US
Continuing Employee," and each Continuing Employee whose home country is
outside of the United States is referred to as a "Non-US Continuing Employee."

(i) Nothing herein will be construed as a representation or guarantee by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that (i) some or all of the In-Scope
Employees will accept employment with the Galleria Group or (ii) some or all
of the In-Scope Employees will become employed by or continue in employment
with the Galleria Group for any period of time; provided, however, that,
unless prohibited by applicable Law, if an In-Scope Employee (other than any
Choice Employee) refuses employment with the Galleria Group (the terms and
conditions of which employment are consistent with the provisions of Section
6.04), Parent will or will cause its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment
of such employee with Parent and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Closing
Date and, notwithstanding Section 5.15, but subject to applicable Law, Parent
will not hire any such employee for 24 months following such termination.

(j) With respect to any Galleria Business Employee who is working in any
country pursuant to a local visa or similar authorization as of the Closing,
Acquiror, the Galleria Group and Parent will use their Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to allow such Galleria Business Employee to transfer to a member of
the Galleria Group in such country at or prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, if
such transfer measures are not completed as of the Closing Date, such Galleria
Business Employee will remain an employee of Parent or its Subsidiaries, and
will not transfer employment to Acquiror or any of its Affiliates until such
transfer measures are completed (each, a "Delayed Transfer Employee"). Each
Delayed Transfer Employee will not be considered a Continuing Employee unless
and until such transfer measures are completed prior to the second anniversary
of the Closing, and Parent may determine not to transfer such Person if Parent
determines, in its sole discretion, that doing so would materially increase
the likelihood that the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would not apply to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria
Group to provide each Continuing Employee who is working in any host country
listed on Section 6.01 of the Parent Disclosure Letter (as updated pursuant to
Section 6.01) pursuant to a local visa or similar authorization with not less
than 90 days advance notice of any termination by the Galleria Group of the
employee's employment occurring while the employee is working pursuant to such
local visa or similar authorization.

(k) Within 60 days prior to the Closing Date, Parent will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to, and Acquiror will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to,
cooperate to identify and effect the transfer to a member of the Galleria
Group of any individual retained as an independent contractor whose services
are required to transfer to a member of the Galleria Group as of the Closing
pursuant to applicable Law.

6.03 Establishing Galleria Group Plans. (n) Establishing Plans. Prior to the
Closing, Parent and Acquiror will mutually cooperate pursuant to the
Transition Plan process as set forth in Section 5.21 of this Agreement in
order to establish any compensation and benefit plans for the Galleria Group
(the "Galleria Group Plans"). The Galleria Group Plans will be sponsored and
maintained by the Galleria Group. The Galleria Group Plans will have terms and
conditions that meet the requirements of Section 6.04, provided, however, that
the requirements of Section 6.04 will be applied as if those requirements were
applied prior to the Closing and as if they were applied by reference to any
terms and conditions in effect immediately before the Galleria Business
Employees are employed by the Galleria Group. The Galleria Group will be
responsible for all Liabilities and obligations under COBRA and applicable
state or similar Laws with respect to any "qualifying event" (within the
meaning of Section 4980B of the Code) of any Galleria Business Employees or
their eligible dependents occurring on or after the date such individuals
commence participation in a group health plan sponsored by a member of the
Galleria Group or, if earlier, the Closing Date.

(o) Galleria Business Acquired Plans. Acquiror and SplitCo will cause one or
more Galleria Group Plans to assume the liabilities associated with the
Galleria Business Acquired Plans as provided on Section 1.05(a)(xiii) of the
Parent Disclosure Letter. Parent will cause the transfer of assets in respect
of such liabilities as provided on Section 1.05(a)(xiii) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter.

6.04 Terms of Employment. (i) Place of Employment. During the two-year period
that begins as of the Closing or such shorter period as such Continuing
Employee remains an employee of an Employing Entity following the Closing (the
"Continuation Period"), Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to
provide to each Continuing Employee employment in a position with a primary
place of employment that is not greater than 50 miles (or such lesser number
of miles in a relevant jurisdiction as may be established pursuant to
applicable Law) from such Continuing Employee's primary place of employment
immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however, that if a Continuing
Employee is a party to a written agreement with a member of the Parent Group
as of the date of this Agreement that includes a "mobility" provision pursuant
to which such Continuing Employee may be relocated by his or her employer at
any time, then, to the extent such "mobility" provision remains in effect with
respect to such Continuing Employee, the 50 mile (or less) restriction set
forth in this Section 6.04(a) will not apply to such Continuing Employee to
the extent such restriction is inconsistent with such "mobility" provision in
such agreement.

(j) Compensation and Benefits.

(i) Parent and Acquiror will implement the provisions set forth on Schedule
6.04(b)(i).

(ii) If Acquiror and SplitCo fail to comply with their obligations under
Section 6.04 in any material respect with respect to any Continuing Employee
during the Continuation Period, such Continuing Employee will be eligible to
resign and receive severance benefits pursuant to Section 6.04(c).

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, all issuances
of equity-based compensation by Acquiror or any Affiliate thereof will be
subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of the Tax Matters
Agreement.

(k) Severance. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(b) but subject
to Section 6.04(i)(iii) and Section 1.06(b)(i), with respect to each
Continuing Employee who incurs a Qualifying Termination during the
Continuation Period, Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to
provide such employee with the severance payments and benefits set forth on
Section 6.04(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, and under the applicable
formula set forth on the attachment to Section 6.04(c) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter. As a condition to the payment of any such severance to any
Continuing Employee, such Continuing Employee must provide a general waiver
and release of claims in a form substantially similar to the form used for
similarly situated Galleria Group employees (except that such release must
also include a provision for general waiver and release of claims for the
benefit of Parent and its Affiliates) and such release must be effective.
Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, the payment of any severance
pursuant to this Section 6.04(c) will be made on the 60th day following the
date of termination of employment (or, if applicable, at such times as
permitted under Section 409A of the Code so as to avoid such payment from
being subject to any penalties under Section 409A of the Code).

(l) Compensation Consultant Process. The determination of whether Acquiror and
SplitCo are in compliance with Section 6.04(b)(i) will be made by Parent and
Acquiror based on proposed terms and conditions provided by SplitCo at least
60 days prior to the date on which it is expected that offers and terms and
conditions of employment will be presented to employees pursuant to Section
6.02(b). If Parent and Acquiror are unable to agree within 20 Business Days
following Acquiror's receipt of the applicable information, the determination
will be made within ten additional Business Days by an internationally
recognized compensation consultant designated by Parent (at Parent's cost),
subject to the approval of a compensation consultant designated by Acquiror
(at Acquiror's cost), which approval may only be withheld if Acquiror's
compensation consultant reasonably believes that Parent's compensation
consultant has used unreasonable assumptions or otherwise made an error. In
the event such approval is not provided within ten Business Days following the
receipt of the applicable information by Acquiror's compensation consultant,
the compensation consultants designated by Acquiror and Parent will discuss
such comparison in good faith for ten Business Days and seek to reach an
agreement. If such compensation consultants are unable to do so, they will
jointly select a third compensation consultant, which third compensation
consultant will make such comparability determination within ten Business Days
after the expiration of such ten-Business Day discussion period, which
comparability determination will be binding (the process described in this
sentence and the three preceding sentences, the "Compensation Consultant
Process"). Parent and Acquiror will share equally the cost of any such third
compensation consultant. If the Compensation Consultant Process finally
determines that Acquiror and SplitCo have not complied with Section 6.04(b)(i)
(such difference, the "Compensation Gap"), then Acquiror and SplitCo will
cause the Galleria Group to either adjust the compensation or benefits of each
applicable Continuing Employee so that they are in compliance with Section
6.04(b)(i) or provide each applicable Continuing Employee for the duration of
the Continuation Period (including any prior portion of the Continuation
Period during which Acquiror and SplitCo have not been in compliance with
Section 6.04(b)(i)) a cash payment amount (on a net after-Tax basis)
determined by the Compensation Consultant Process to be equal to the
Compensation Gap (such cash payment amount, the "Compensation Gap Payment").
Each Compensation Gap Payment will be paid on the same schedule as the
applicable Continuing Employee's regular base pay (with the first Compensation
Gap Payment including amounts in respect of any prior portion of the
Continuation Period during which Acquiror and SplitCo have not been in
compliance with Section 6.04(b)(i)).

(m) Welfare Plans. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Acquiror and
SplitCo will cause each benefit plan of the Galleria Group in which any
Continuing Employee participates that is a health or welfare benefit plan
(collectively, "Acquiror Welfare Plans") to (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and service conditions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to Continuing Employees,
other than limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing
Employees as of the Closing Date under the corresponding Compensation and
Benefit Plan or Galleria Group Plan, (ii) honor any payments, charges and
expenses of such Continuing Employees (and their eligible dependents) that
were applied toward the deductible and out-of-pocket maximums under the
corresponding Compensation and Benefit Plan or Galleria Group Plan in
satisfying any applicable deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums or co-payments
under a corresponding Acquiror Welfare Plan during the same plan year in which
such payments, charges and expenses were made, and (iii) waive any waiting
period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise
be applicable to a Continuing Employee following the Closing Date to the
extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation under the
corresponding Compensation and Benefit Plan or Galleria Group Plan.

(n) Earned Vacation. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Acquiror and
SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to credit each Continuing Employee the
amount of accrued and unpaid hours of vacation, personal hours or days earned
and sick leave (together, the "Transferred Leave") applicable to such
Continuing Employee as of the Closing and Parent or SplitCo will provide to
Acquiror as of the Closing Date a schedule indicating for each Continuing
Employee the type and number of days of Transferred Leave; provided, however,
subject to applicable Law, Acquiror will credit such Transferred Leave only to
the extent reflected as part of the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement.
Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to ensure that such
Transferred Leave (i) is not subject to forfeiture, to the same extent not
subject to forfeiture under the policies of Parent and its Subsidiaries
governing such Transferred Leave prior to the Closing and (ii) does not count
toward any maximum accrual amount under any plan, program or policy maintained
by the Galleria Group after the Closing for the purpose of providing vacation,
personal days or hours or sick leave (collectively, the "Galleria Leave
Plan"); provided, however, if a Continuing Employee has Transferred Leave in
excess of the applicable maximum under the Galleria Leave Plan, once the
Continuing Employee uses the type and number of days of Transferred Leave
equal to the applicable maximum accrual under the Galleria Leave Plan, then
such Continuing Employee's remaining Transferred Leave will be subject to the
applicable maximum accrual under the Galleria Leave Plan. Subject to
applicable Law, Acquiror will have the option either to pay cash to a
Continuing Employee following the Closing in cancellation of all or a portion
of the Transferred Leave that is in excess of the applicable maximum accrual
under the Galleria Leave Plan or to permit such Continuing Employee to use
such excess Transferred Leave. If applicable Law does not allow for
Transferred Leave with respect to any Continuing Employee, Acquiror and
SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to allow such Continuing Employee to use
any leave time following the Closing that was scheduled with Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing (on an unpaid basis in the event that such
Continuing Employee has not accrued enough paid leave time at the time of such
post-Closing absence).

(o) Expatriate Employees. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(b),
with respect to Continuing Employees who, as of the Closing, receive specific
expatriate payments or benefits from Parent or its Subsidiaries (an
"Expatriate Package," and each such employee, an "Expatriate Employee"),
Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group during the Continuation
Period to (i) maintain a comparable Expatriate Package for each such
Expatriate Employee until such Expatriate Employee (A) returns to his or her
home country (excluding any temporary return) or (B) ceases to be employed
with Acquiror or one of its Subsidiaries provided that such Expatriate
Employee is returned to his or her home country and (ii) pay the costs of
repatriation for each Expatriate Employee to the same extent and on the same
terms as provided for in Parent's or its applicable Subsidiary's policies and
practices, as applicable, immediately prior to the Closing; provided, however,
Acquiror will maintain and pay for such repatriation only to the extent such
Expatriate Employee and such Expatriate Package are listed on Section
6.04(g)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter. Parent may update Section
6.04(g)(i) of the Parent Disclosure Letter from time to time prior to the
Closing Date in order to reflect transfers and new hires in accordance with
Section 5.01(b)(xii)-(xiv). Following the Continuation Period, Acquiror and
SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to provide expatriate payments and
benefits to such Continuing Employees in accordance with the policies of the
Galleria Group as in effect from time to time, but in any event Acquiror or
SplitCo will provide at least the minimum repatriation benefits as set forth
on Section 6.04(g)(ii) of the Parent Disclosure Letter.

(p) Localized Employees. Without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(b),
with respect to Continuing Employees who, prior to the Closing, have been
localized other than in their original home country and receive specific
benefits from Parent or its Subsidiaries relating to their localized status (a
"Localization Package," and each such employee, a "Localized Employee"),
Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group during the Continuation
Period to maintain a comparable Localization Package (excluding, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law, the International Retirement Arrangement
and the International Pension Protection Program) for each such Localized
Employee until his or her employment terminates only to the extent such
Localized Employees are listed on Section 6.04(h) of the Parent Disclosure
Letter. Parent may update Section 6.04(h) of the Parent Disclosure Letter from
time to time prior to the Closing Date in order to reflect transfers and new
hires in accordance with Section 5.01(b)(xii)-(xiv). Following the
Continuation Period, Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to
provide a Localization Package to such Continuing Employees in accordance with
the policies of the Galleria Group as in effect from time to time.

(q) Special Rules for Non-US Employees. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, any In-Scope Employee who is employed by
a member of the Parent Group in a non-US jurisdiction immediately prior to the
Closing, and who is required by applicable Law to transfer to a member of the
Galleria Group in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, will transfer automatically on the
Closing Date to SplitCo or a member of the Galleria Group in accordance with
such applicable Law and will be deemed to be a Continuing Employee and a Non-
US Continuing Employee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
following terms will apply to all Non-US Continuing Employees:

(iii) To the extent that (A) the applicable Law of any jurisdiction, (B) any
applicable collective bargaining agreement or other applicable agreement with
a works council or economic committee, or (C) any applicable employment
agreement, would require Acquiror or its Affiliates (including a member of the
Galleria Group) to provide any more favorable terms of employment to any Non-
US Continuing Employee than those otherwise provided for by this Section 6.04
(or extend the period of time for which such standards are met), in connection
with the Conveyance of the Galleria Business to SplitCo, then Acquiror and
SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to provide such Non-US Continuing
Employee with such more favorable term, and otherwise provide terms of
employment in accordance with this Section 6.04.

(iv) Acquiror and Parent agree that to the extent provided under the
applicable Laws of certain foreign jurisdictions, (A) any employment
agreements between Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Non-US
Continuing Employee, on the other hand, and (B) any collective bargaining
agreements applicable to the Non-US Continuing Employees in such
jurisdictions, will in each case have effect after the Closing as if
originally made between Acquiror and the other parties to such employment
agreement or collective bargaining agreement.

(v) Any Liabilities for severance pay or benefits (whether statutory,
contractual or otherwise) to an In-Scope Employee arising from (A) the
termination of such In-Scope Employee (other than a Choice Employee) from
employment with any member of the Parent Group or the Galleria Group as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) the
termination of any Continuing Employee from employment with any member of the
Acquiror Group on or after the Closing Date will be Galleria Liabilities and
will be the sole responsibility of Acquiror; provided, however, subject to
applicable Law, to the extent Parent, SplitCo, Acquiror or any of its
Affiliates are required to pay any such severance pay or benefits, such
severance pay and benefits shall offset any severance pay and benefits that
would otherwise be required to be paid to such Continuing Employee following
the Closing.

6.05 Bonuses and Incentives. (h) Except as otherwise set forth in Section
6.05(b), Parent will retain all obligations to the Galleria Business
Employees, including Continuing Employees, with respect to the bonuses and
incentives under Parent's Short Term Achievement Reward (STAR) bonus program,
Long-Term Incentive (LTI) program, Key Manager Stock Option Program and any
other cash, annual, long-term, equity or similar incentive program of Parent
in which the Continuing Employees participate for the plan year in which the
Closing Date occurs that are attributable to the period of such participation
prior to the Closing; provided, however, that, if requested by Parent,
Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to make all cash payments
in respect of any such program so long as Parent transfers to the Galleria
Group, as of the Closing, all amounts payable in respect of such cash
obligations that are attributable to the period prior to the Closing during
which the Continuing Employees participated in such program and any associated
Taxes payable by the Galleria Group in connection with such cash payments (but
Parent will not be liable for any Tax withholding except to the extent it is
required to remit any such Tax withheld from any such bonuses and incentives
to the appropriate Governmental Authority).

(i) Notwithstanding Section 6.05(a), Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the
Galleria Group to pay to each Continuing Employee any 13th month, 14th month,
jubilee or similar payment, as applicable, that would next be payable
following the Closing at such time as Parent or its Subsidiary would have made
such payments (for example, if the Closing takes place on September 30, 2015,
and a 13th month payment would have been paid on December 31, 2015, then the
Galleria Group will make such payment on December 31, 2015) in an amount not
less than the applicable amount included in respect thereof as part of the
Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement (to the extent such amount included in
respect thereof as part of the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement remains
unpaid as of the Closing Date), in each instance regardless of the applicable
Continuing Employee's employment status on the relevant payment date and
irrespective of whether applicable Law requires such payment(s).

6.06 Credit for Service with Parent. Where applicable, Acquiror and its
Affiliates (including the Galleria Group) will provide credit for each
Continuing Employee's length of service with Parent and its Affiliates
(including, prior to Closing, the Galleria Group) for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and level of benefits) under (a) each plan, program,
policy or arrangement of Acquiror and its Affiliates to the same extent such
service was recognized under a similar plan, program, policy or arrangement of
Parent or any of its Affiliates, and (b) applicable Law (including the Family
and Medical Leave Act of 1993) in each case, except that such prior service
credit will not be required to the extent that it results in a duplication of
benefits provided by Parent (including any duplication of benefits under a
defined benefit pension plan); provided, however, that Acquiror and its
Affiliates (including the Galleria Group) will (i) not be required to provide
prior service credit pursuant to this Section 6.06 for purposes of determining
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan for any time period
prior to the Closing except with respect to the Galleria Business Acquired
Plans and (ii) to the extent that, in Acquiror's sole discretion, any
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in a defined benefit
pension plan following the Closing, provide prior service credit for all
purposes other than as set forth in clause (i) above, including the
calculation of benefit accruals for any time that elapses after the Closing
or, if later, the date on which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in such a defined benefit pension plan.

6.07 Workers' Compensation. Parent will retain the obligation for any workers'
compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of the US Continuing Employees
(and the Non-US Continuing Employees to the extent workers' compensation
benefits are applicable under the Laws of the relevant jurisdiction) with
respect to any events, illnesses, injuries or conditions arising on or prior
to the Closing Date. Acquiror and its Subsidiaries will assume and be
responsible for all workers' compensation benefits payable to or on behalf of
the US Continuing Employees (and the Non-US Continuing Employees to the extent
workers' compensation benefits are applicable under the Laws of the relevant
jurisdiction) with respect to any events, illnesses, injuries or conditions
arising after the Closing Date, including any illnesses, injuries or
conditions arising after the Closing Date that are aggravations or reinjuries
of illnesses, injuries or conditions arising on or prior to the Closing Date.

6.08 WARN Act. Acquiror and SplitCo will cause the Galleria Group to (a)
provide any required notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act or any other similar Law (the "WARN Act") and (b) otherwise
comply with the WARN Act with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff"
(as defined in the WARN Act) or group termination or similar event affecting
Continuing Employees (including as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements) and
occurring from and after the Closing. Acquiror will not, and will not permit
any of its Affiliates (including the Galleria Group) to, take any action on or
after the Closing Date that would cause any termination of employment by
Parent or its Affiliates of any employees of the Galleria Business or any
Galleria Entity occurring prior to the Closing to constitute a "plant
closing," "mass layoff" or group termination or similar event under the WARN
Act, or to create any Liability or penalty to Parent or any of its Affiliates
for any employment terminations under applicable Law. Parent or its Affiliates
will notify Acquiror of any involuntary terminations of any U.S. employees of
the Galleria Business or any member of the Galleria Group that occur during
the 90-day period prior to the Closing.

6.09 Miscellaneous. (h) Following the date of this Agreement, Parent (and its
Subsidiaries) and Acquiror (and its Subsidiaries) will reasonably cooperate
and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in all matters reasonably necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated by this Article VI, including (i)
exchanging information and data, including (A) reports prepared in connection
with bonus plan participation and related data of Continuing Employees and all
other information reasonably necessary for the Parent Group or the Acquiror
Group to comply with the covenants contained in this Article VI and (B)
information relating to workers' compensation, employee benefits and employee
benefit plan coverages, including information and data that is necessary to
support or perform the Compensation Consultant Process or that is otherwise
reasonably requested in connection with the Compensation Consultant Process
(in each case, except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law or to the
extent that such information and data relates to performance ratings or
assessments of employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries), (ii) making any and
all required filings and notices, (iii) making any and all required
communications with Galleria Business Employees and (iv) obtaining any
Governmental Approvals required hereunder.

(i) Parent shall coordinate with Acquiror to arrange for one or more town hall
meetings to allow Acquiror the opportunity to communicate with available In-
Scope Employees and Choice Employees as soon as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, any
communications between Acquiror and any employees of Parent and its Affiliates
regarding terms of employment, employee benefits or otherwise regarding
employment with the Galleria Group will be conducted at the times and through
processes approved by Parent, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
Such processes will provide adequate access to the Galleria Business Employees
and allow all reasonable means of communication with such employees by
Acquiror and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that any communications with
Galleria Business Employees or any other employees of Parent or its Affiliates
will be limited to employee benefit matters relating to Galleria Business
Employees, future organization design and staffing.

(j) Without limiting the obligations of Acquiror and SplitCo under this
Article VI with respect to the Continuing Employees, this Article VI will not
(i) constitute or be treated as an amendment of, or undertaking to amend any
employee benefit plan in which Parent's or any of its Affiliates', or
Acquiror's or any of its Subsidiaries', employees participate or (ii) prohibit
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries (including the Galleria Group) from
amending any employee benefit plan in which Acquiror's or such Subsidiary's
employees participate.

(k) Acquiror will comply with its obligations, if any, to provide notice to or
consult with any union or works council representing its employees or the
employees of its Subsidiaries.

Parent in all material respects;

(q) (i) the representations and warranties of Parent in this Agreement (other

respects as of the Closing with the same effect as if made at and as of the
Closing (except that any representation and warranty in any Section that is

would not in the aggregate have a Galleria Business MAE, (ii) the

the foregoing opinion, counsel will be permitted to rely upon and assume the
accuracy of customary representations provided by (i) Acquiror and Merger Sub
and (ii) Parent, substantially in the form of the representation letters
attached hereto on Exhibit J and Exhibit K, respectively; and

(s) Acquiror shall have received a certificate of Parent addressed to Acquiror
and dated the Closing Date, signed on behalf of Parent by an officer of Parent
(on Parent's behalf and without personal liability), confirming the matters
set forth in Section 7.02(a) and Section 7.02(b).

7.03 Conditions to the Obligation of Parent. The obligation of Parent and

Distribution and the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of each of the
following conditions (each of which is for the exclusive benefit of Parent and

as though none of them contained any materiality or Acquiror MAE
qualifications) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing
with the same effect as if made at and as of the Closing (except that any
representation and warranty in any Section that is made as of a date other
than the date of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as
of the specified date), except where the failure of the representations and
warranties to be true and correct in all respects would not have in the
aggregate an Acquiror MAE;

(t) Parent shall have received a written opinion, dated as of the Closing
Date, from Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft LLP, counsel to Parent, to the effect
that the Merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. In rendering
the foregoing opinion, counsel will be permitted to rely upon and assume the
accuracy of customary representations provided by (i) Acquiror and Merger Sub
and (ii) Parent, substantially in the form of the representation letters
attached hereto on Exhibit J and Exhibit K, respectively;

(u) Parent shall have received a written opinion, dated as of the Closing
Date, from Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft LLP, counsel to Parent, to the effect
that (i) the Galleria Transfer, taken together with the Distribution, should
qualify as a tax-free reorganization pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the
Code, (ii) the Distribution, as such, should qualify as a distribution of
SplitCo stock to Parent stockholders pursuant to Section 355 of the Code and
(iii) the Merger should not cause Section 355(e) of the Code to apply to the
Distribution. In rendering the foregoing opinion, counsel will be permitted to

(v) subject to the obligation to extend the expiration date of the Exchange
Offer pursuant to the proviso in the first sentence of Section 2.01(c), if
Parent elects to effect the Distribution by way of an Exchange Offer,
shareholders of Parent shall have validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
before the expiration of the Exchange Offer enough shares of Parent Common
Stock such that Parent will distribute to its shareholders in the Exchange
Offer a percentage of the shares of SplitCo Common Stock issued to Parent in
the Galleria Stock Issuance that exceeds the percentage derived from the
formula set forth on Exhibit E (the "Minimum Condition"); provided, however,
that, at any time prior to the Closing Date, Parent, in its reasonable
judgment and after consultation with Acquiror, may reapply the formula set
forth on Exhibit E using updated information reflecting the then current data
or otherwise increase the Minimum Condition by the minimum amount necessary,
in each case, to ensure that the equation set forth in such Exhibit is
satisfied;

(w) Acquiror shall have irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that each
condition to Acquiror's obligation to effect the Closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as provided in Section 7.01 and Section 7.02
of this Agreement, shall have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied contemporaneously with
the Closing);

(x) an Acquiror SEC Event shall not have occurred;

(y) Parent shall have received a certificate of Acquiror addressed to Parent
and dated the Closing Date, signed on behalf of Acquiror by an officer of
Acquiror (on Acquiror's behalf and without personal liability), confirming the
matters set forth in Section 7.03(a) and Section 7.03(b); and

(z) there shall be no shares of Acquiror Capital Stock (including Acquiror
Common Stock) outstanding other than shares of Class A Common Stock (including
restricted stock units convertible into Class A Common Stock, Acquiror Options
and Phantom Units) and Series A Preferred Stock.

7.04 Additional Conditions to Each Party's Obligation To Effect the Merger.
The obligations of Parent, SplitCo, Acquiror and Merger Sub to effect the
Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

(j) the Galleria Transfer and the Recapitalization shall have been consummated
in accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement; and

(k) the Distribution shall have been consummated in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement.

7.05 Frustration of Conditions. Neither Parent nor Acquiror may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.01, Section 7.02, Section 7.03
or Section 7.04 as the case may be, to be satisfied to excuse it from its
obligation to effect the transactions contemplated hereby if such failure was
caused by such Party's breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

VIII. TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT

8.01 Basis for Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time prior to the Closing
Date:

(t) by mutual written consent of Parent and Acquiror;

(u) by either Parent or Acquiror:

(v) if the Closing does not occur on or prior to January 31, 2017 (the "End
Date"), unless the failure of the Closing to occur by such date is due to the
failure of the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or observe
in all material respects the covenants of such Party set forth herein; or

(vi) if (A) there is any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
hereunder illegal or otherwise prohibited (other than those having only an
immaterial effect and that do not impose criminal liability or penalties) or
(B) any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction has issued an
Order or taken any other action (which the terminating Party must have
complied with its obligations hereunder to resist, resolve or lift)
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any material
component of the transactions contemplated hereunder, and such Order or other
action becomes final and non-appealable;

(v) by Parent:

(iv) if Acquiror or Merger Sub breaches any of its representations and
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would
give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.01 or Section
7.03 and (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days after the giving
of written notice to Acquiror of such breach (or, if earlier, the End Date);

(v) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.03 becomes
incapable of fulfillment, and has not been waived by Parent to the extent
waivable;

(vi) if Parent has commenced an Exchange Offer in accordance with Section
2.01(c) and, following all extensions required under this Agreement, such
Exchange Offer is not consummated as a result of the failure of the Minimum
Condition to be satisfied on the applicable scheduled expiration date of such
Exchange Offer;

(vii) if the Stockholder Consent contemplated by Section 5.08, duly executed
by the Persons set forth on Section 8.01 of the Acquiror Disclosure Letter and
representing at least 50.1% of the voting power represented by all outstanding
shares of Acquiror Common Stock, shall not have been delivered to Parent and
Acquiror within 24 hours following the time of execution of this Agreement; or

(w) by Acquiror:

(i) if Parent or SplitCo breaches any of its representations and warranties or
covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach (A) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02 and (B)
cannot be or has not been cured within 60 days after the giving of written
notice to Parent of such breach (or, if earlier, the End Date); or

(ii) if any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.01 or Section 7.02
becomes incapable of fulfillment, and has not been waived by Acquiror to the
extent waivable;

provided, however, that the Party seeking termination pursuant to clause
(c)(i), (c)(ii), (d)(i) or (d)(ii) is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement.

8.02 Notice of Termination; Return of Documents; Continuing Confidentiality
Obligation. In the event of a termination of this Agreement by Parent or
Acquiror pursuant to this Article VIII, written notice thereof will be given
to the other Party and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements will terminate, without further action by any Party. If
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements
are terminated as provided herein, (a) Acquiror and Merger Sub will return to
Parent or destroy all documents and copies and other material received from
Parent and its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, whether so
obtained before or after the execution hereof, (b) Parent and SplitCo will
return to Acquiror or destroy all documents and copies and other material
received from Acquiror and its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary
Agreements, whether so obtained before or after the execution hereof, and (c)
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement
will be deemed to be reinstated and will be deemed to apply as if it had not
originally been terminated pursuant to Section 10.03.

8.03 Effect of Termination. (l) If this Agreement is duly terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in this Article
VIII, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and effect,
except for the provisions of Section 5.03 relating to publicity, Section 8.02,
this Section 8.03, Articles X and XI containing general provisions and
definitions, respectively, except that nothing in this Article VIII will be
deemed to release any Party from any Liability for any Deliberate Breach by
such Party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the
right of any Party to compel specific performance by another Party of its
obligations under this Agreement that specifically survive such termination as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, receipt by Parent of a payment or reimbursement
pursuant to Section 8.03(b) will not limit the ability of Parent to sue for
any breach of Section 5.09 or collect damages arising from any such breach
(except, in the case of calculation of damages, to the extent a court would
otherwise take such payment or reimbursement into account in assessing damages
for such breach).

(m) Acquiror will pay to Parent a fee of $400 million if Parent terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(c)(iv).

Any fee due under this Section 8.03(b) will be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds (to an account specified by Parent) and will be
paid by Acquiror promptly following termination of this Agreement. Upon
payment of the termination fee in accordance with this Section 8.03(b),
Acquiror will have no further Liability to Parent at Law or in equity under
this Agreement except as specifically set forth in Section 8.03(a).

IX. MUTUAL RELEASES; INDEMNIFICATION

9.01 Release of Pre-Business Transfer Time Claims. (aa) SplitCo Release.
Except as provided in Section 9.01(c), effective as of the Business Transfer
Time, SplitCo does hereby, for itself and each other member of the Galleria
Group, and their respective successors and assigns, remise, release and
forever discharge the Parent Indemnitees from any and all Liabilities
whatsoever, whether at Law or in equity (including any right of contribution),
whether arising under any Contract, by operation of Law or otherwise, existing
or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to
have occurred or to have failed to occur at or before the Business Transfer
Time or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at or before the
Business Transfer Time, including in connection with the transactions and all
other activities to implement the Galleria Transfer.

(bb) Parent Release. Except as provided in Section 9.01(c), effective as of
the Business Transfer Time, Parent does hereby, for itself and each other
member of the Parent Group, and their respective successors and assigns,
remise, release and forever discharge the Acquiror Indemnitees from any and
all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at Law or in equity (including any right
of contribution), whether arising under any Contract, by operation of Law or
otherwise, existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to
occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur at or before the
Business Transfer Time or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed
at or before the Business Transfer Time, including in connection with the
transactions and all other activities to implement any of the Galleria
Transfer.

(cc) No Impairment. Nothing contained in Section 9.01(a) or Section 9.01(b)
will limit or otherwise affect any Party's rights or obligations pursuant to
or contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements, in each case in
accordance with its terms.

(dd) No Actions as to Released Claims. Neither SplitCo nor Acquiror will, and
each will cause each of their respective Affiliates not to, make any claim or
demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand, including any
claim of contribution or any indemnification, against Parent or any member of
the Parent Group, or any other Person released pursuant to Section 9.01(a),
with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to Section 9.01(a). Parent
will not, and will cause each other member of the Parent Group not to, make
any claim or demand, or commence any Action asserting any claim or demand,
including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against SplitCo,
Acquiror or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person released
pursuant to Section 9.01(b), with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant
to Section 9.01(b).

9.02 Indemnification by Acquiror and the Galleria Group. Without limiting or
otherwise affecting the indemnity provisions of any Ancillary Agreement, but
subject to the limitations set forth in this Article IX, from and after the
Closing Date, Acquiror, SplitCo and each of the Galleria Entities will, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify, defend (or, where applicable, pay the
defense costs for) and hold harmless the Parent Indemnitees from and against
any and all Losses that result from or arise out of, whether prior to or
following the Closing, any of the following items (without duplication):

(n) any Galleria Liability and any Liability of the Galleria Entities,
including the failure of SplitCo or any other member of the Galleria Group or
any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill, discharge and, to the extent
applicable, comply with, in due course and in full, any such Liabilities;

(o) any breach by Acquiror, SplitCo or any other member of the Galleria Group
of any covenant to be performed by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement subsequent to the Effective Time; and

(p) any breach by Acquiror or any of its Affiliates of their obligations in
respect of the Surviving Transaction Agreement Items.

9.03 Indemnification by Parent. Without limiting or otherwise affecting the
indemnity provisions of any Ancillary Agreement but subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article IX, from and after the Closing, Parent will, and
will cause each other member of the Parent Group to, indemnify, defend (or,
where applicable, pay the defense costs for) and hold harmless the Acquiror
Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses that result from, relate to or
arise out of, whether prior to or following the Closing, any of the following
items (without duplication):

(r) any Excluded Liability, including the failure of Parent or any other
member of the Parent Group or any other Person to pay, perform, fulfill,
discharge, and, to the extent applicable, comply with, in due course and in
full, such Excluded Liabilities;

(s) any breach by Parent or any other member of the Parent Group of any
covenant to be performed by such Persons pursuant to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement subsequent to the Effective Time; and

(t) any breach by Parent or any of its Affiliates of their obligations in
respect of the Surviving Transaction Agreement Items.

9.04 Calculation and Other Provisions Relating to Indemnity Payments. (u)
Insurance. The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under
this Article IX will be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnitee or its Affiliates under third-party, non-captive insurance policies
with respect to such Loss (less the cost to collect the proceeds of such
insurance). If any Loss resulting in indemnification under Sections 9.02 or
9.03 relates to a claim by an Indemnitee or its Affiliates that is covered by
one or more third-party, non-captive insurance policies held by the Indemnitee
or its Affiliates, the Indemnitee will use and will cause its Affiliates to
use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to pursue claims against the applicable
insurers for coverage of such Loss under such policies. Any indemnity payment
hereunder will initially be made without regard to this Section 9.04(a), and
if the Indemnitee or its Affiliates actually receive a full or partial
recovery under such insurance policies following payment of indemnification by
the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, then the Indemnitee will
refund amounts received from the Indemnifying Party up to the amount of
indemnification actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such Loss (less the cost to collect the proceeds of such insurance).

(v) Taxes. In the absence of a Final Determination to the contrary and except
for any post-Distribution interest, any amount payable by SplitCo to Parent
under this Agreement will be treated as occurring immediately prior to the
transactions contemplated hereby, as an inter-company distribution, and any
amount payable by Parent to SplitCo under this Agreement will be treated as
occurring immediately prior to the transactions contemplated hereby, as a
contribution to capital. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the amount that any
Indemnifying Party is or may be required to provide indemnification to or on
behalf of any Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement will be (i) decreased to
offset any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof)
arising from the incurrence or payment of the relevant indemnified item and
(ii) increased to offset any Tax cost incurred by the Indemnitee (or an
Affiliate thereof) arising from the receipt of any indemnification payments
hereunder, unless in the case of clause (ii) such amount is already included
in the applicable calculation of Losses. Any indemnity payment hereunder will
initially be made without regard to this Section 9.04(b) and will be reduced
or increased, as the case may be, to reflect any applicable Tax benefit or Tax
cost within 30 days after the Indemnitee (or an Affiliate thereof) realizes
such Tax benefit or incurs such Tax cost, respectively. In the event of a
Final Determination relating to the Indemnitee's (or an Affiliate's)
incurrence or payment of an indemnified item or receipt of an indemnity
payment pursuant to this Section 9.04(b), the Indemnitee will, within 30 days
of such Final Determination, provide the other Party with notice thereof and
supporting documentation addressing, in reasonable detail, the amount of any
reduction or increase in Taxes of the Indemnitee (or its Affiliate) resulting
from such Final Determination, and the Parties will promptly make any payments
necessary to reflect the relevant reduction or increase in Tax liability.

(w) Items Included in Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement. Notwithstanding any
other provision hereof, the Acquiror Parties will have no right to make any
claims against Parent for indemnification hereunder in respect of any
Liability (i) to the extent that the Liability was specifically reflected on
the Cut-Off Date Adjustment Statement or (ii) to the extent it would result in
a duplicative payment or benefit to the Acquiror Parties of amounts recovered
pursuant to Section 2.15.

(x) Claims Relating To Restructuring or Transition Plan. In the event that
Acquiror waives the closing condition in Section 7.02(a) in respect of
Parent's performance of its covenants relating to specific components or steps
in the development or implementation of the Restructuring or Transition Plan,
then no Acquiror Indemnitee will be entitled to seek indemnity under, and
Parent will have no obligation to indemnify any Acquiror Indemnitee with
respect to, Section 9.03(b) insofar as it relates to the performance by Parent
of such covenants in respect of which such condition was waived.

9.05 Procedures for Defense, Settlement and Indemnification of Claims. (r)
Direct Claims. All claims made hereunder by (i) any member of the Parent
Group, on the one hand, against Acquiror or any member of the Galleria Group,
on the other hand, or (ii) by any Acquiror or any member of the Galleria
Group, on the one hand, against Parent or any member of the Parent Group, on
the other hand (collectively, "Direct Claims"), will be subject to the
limitations and dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 10.15. If
an Indemnitee receives notice or otherwise learns of any matter that may be
the subject of a Direct Claim, such Indemnitee will give the Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice thereof but in any event within 15 days after
receiving such notice or otherwise learning of such matter. Any such notice
will describe the matter in reasonable detail, stating the nature, basis for
indemnification and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with copies
of any relevant documents evidencing such matter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the delay or failure of any Indemnitee or other Person to give
notice as provided in this Section 9.05(a) will not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article IX, except to the extent that such
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or failure to give notice.

(s) Third-Party Claims. (t) Notice of Claims. If an Indemnitee receives notice
or otherwise learns of the assertion by a Person (including any Governmental
Authority) which is not a member of the Parent Group or the Acquiror Group
(including after the Closing, the Galleria Group) of any claim or of the
commencement by any such Person of any Action with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide indemnification (collectively,
a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party
prompt written notice (a "Claims Notice") thereof but in any event within 15
days after becoming aware of such Third-Party Claim. Any such notice will
describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, stating the nature, basis
for indemnification and the amount thereof, to the extent known, along with
copies of any relevant documents evidencing such Third-Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delay or failure of any Indemnitee or other
Person to give notice as provided in this Section 9.05(b) will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article IX, except to the
extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such delay or failure to
give notice.

(i) Opportunity to Defend. The Indemnifying Party has the right, exercisable
by written notice to the Indemnitee within 90 days after receipt of a Claims
Notice from the Indemnitee of the commencement or assertion of any Third-Party
Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article IX, to
assume and conduct the defense of such Third-Party Claim in accordance with
the limits set forth in this Agreement with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee; provided,
however, that (A) the Third-Party Claim does not relate to or arise in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (B) the Third-Party Claim solely seeks (and continues to seek)
monetary damages or equitable or corrective relief (with or without monetary
damages, fines or penalties) which equitable relief would not reasonably be
expected to adversely affect in any material respect the operations of (1)
Parent or its Affiliates, if Acquiror is the Indemnifying Party or (2)
Acquiror or its Affiliates (including after the Closing, any member of the
Galleria Group), if Parent is the Indemnifying Party, and (C) the Indemnifying
Party expressly agrees with the Indemnitee in writing to be fully responsible
for all of the Losses that arise from the Third-Party Claim, subject to the
limitations thereon set forth in this Article IX (the conditions set forth in
clauses (A) through (C) are, collectively, the "Litigation Conditions"). For
purposes of clause (C) of the preceding sentence, if a Third-Party Claim
consists of multiple claims by a plaintiff or group of plaintiffs, and it is
reasonably practicable for an Indemnifying Party to control the defense of a
subset of such claims, the Indemnifying Party may elect to agree to be fully
responsible subject to the limitations thereon set forth in this Article IX,
for only all of the Losses that arise from such subset of claims, and may
elect to control the defense of only such subset of claims; provided, that the
other Litigation Conditions set forth in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the
preceding sentence are satisfied. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section 9.05(b),
the Indemnitee may continue to defend the Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim as provided
in this Section 9.05(b), the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the
defense of the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that if (x) any of the
Litigation Conditions ceases to be met, (y) the Indemnifying Party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third-Party Claim,
or (z) in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnitee based on the advice of
counsel, there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee with respect to such Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be
liable for all reasonable costs or expenses thereafter incurred in connection
with such defense. The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnitee, as the case may
be, has the right to participate in (but, subject to the prior sentence, not
control), at its own expense, the defense of any Third-Party Claim that the
other is defending as provided in this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party, if
it has assumed the defense of any Third-Party Claim as provided in this
Agreement, may not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee,
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any
such Third-Party Claim unless such settlement or judgment includes as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the
Indemnitee of a complete release from all liability in respect of such Third-
Party Claim and unless such settlement or judgment does not impose injunctive
or other non-monetary equitable relief against the Indemnitee or its
Affiliates, or their respective businesses. The Indemnitee has the right to
settle any Third-Party Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the
Indemnifying Party, with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, Parent
will have the right to assert, prosecute, settle and receive the proceeds of
any counter-claims or affirmative defenses of the Parent Group that are
otherwise an Galleria Asset.

(u) Without limiting any provision of this Section 9.05, each of the Parties
will reasonably cooperate, and will cause each of its respective Affiliates to
reasonably cooperate, with each other in the defense of any claim that the
Galleria Business infringes Intellectual Property of any third Person, and no
Party will knowingly acknowledge, or permit any member of its respective Group
to acknowledge, the validity or infringing use of any Intellectual Property of
a third Person in a manner as to which such Party has actual knowledge that so
doing will be materially inconsistent with the defense of such infringement,
validity or similar claim or challenge except as required by Law. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein will preclude truthful testimony by Parent
or any of its representatives or employees, and such truthful testimony will
not be deemed a breach hereof.

(v) In the event Acquiror promptly notifies Parent in writing that Parent or
one of its Affiliates has challenged the validity of any Intellectual Property
of the Galleria Business, Parent will withdraw or cause such challenge to be
withdrawn within five Business Days following receipt of such written notice
from Acquiror.

9.06 Additional Matters. (l) Cooperation in Defense and Settlement. With
respect to any Third-Party Claim for which Acquiror or SplitCo, on the one
hand, and Parent, on the other hand, may have Liability under this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements, the Parties agree to cooperate fully and
maintain a joint defense (in a manner that will preserve the attorney-client
privilege, joint defense or other privilege with respect thereto) so as to
minimize such Liabilities and defense costs associated therewith. The Party
that is not responsible for managing the defense of such Third-Party Claims
will, upon reasonable request, be consulted with respect to significant
matters relating thereto and may retain counsel to monitor or assist in the
defense of such claims at its own cost.

(m) Certain Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Article IX, Parent may elect to have exclusive authority and control over
the investigation, prosecution, defense and appeal of any and all Actions
pending at the Business Transfer Time which relate to or arise out of the
Galleria Business, the Galleria Assets or the Galleria Liabilities and as to
which a member of the Parent Group is also a plaintiff or named as a target or
defendant thereunder (but excluding any such Actions which solely relate to or
solely arise in connection with the Galleria Business, the Galleria Assets or
the Galleria Liabilities); provided, however, that, (i) Parent will defend or
prosecute, as applicable, such Actions in good faith, (ii) Parent will
reasonably consult with SplitCo on a regular basis with respect to strategy
and developments with respect to any such Action, (iii) SplitCo will have the
right to participate in (but not control) the defense or prosecution, as
applicable, of such Action, and (iv) Parent must obtain the written consent of
SplitCo, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
to settle or compromise or consent to the entry of judgment with respect to
such Action if Parent is a defendant and such settlement, consent or judgment
would require SplitCo to abandon its rights, change its business practices or
incur any Liabilities with respect thereto or if Parent is a plaintiff and the
resolution involves a judgment that is less than was being sought in respect
of the Galleria Business. After any such compromise, settlement, consent to
entry of judgment or entry of judgment, Parent and SplitCo will agree upon a
reasonable allocation to SplitCo and SplitCo will be responsible for or
receive, as the case may be, SplitCo's proportionate share of any such
compromise, settlement, consent or judgment attributable to the Galleria
Business, the Galleria Assets or the Galleria Liabilities, including its
proportionate share of the reasonable costs and expenses associated with
defending same.

(n) Reasonable Minimization of Losses. To the extent any remedial, corrective
or other ameliorative action is required to be taken by an Indemnitee in
respect of a matter that is the subject of an indemnification claim hereunder,
the Indemnitee will only be entitled for indemnification in respect of those
actions that would be necessary to perform the minimum necessary remediation,
correction or amelioration to remedy the breach or Liability, as the case may
be, at the lowest reasonable cost.

(o) Substitution. In the event of an Action that involves solely matters that
are indemnifiable and in which the Indemnifying Party is not a named
defendant, if either the Indemnitee or the Indemnifying Party so requests, the
Parties will endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying Party for the named
defendant. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason
or is not requested, the rights and obligations of the Parties regarding
indemnification and the management of the defense of claims as set forth in
this Article IX will not be affected.

(p) Subrogation. In the event of payment by or on behalf of any Indemnifying
Party to or on behalf of any Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party
Claim, such Indemnifying Party will be subrogated to and will stand in the
place of such Indemnitee, in whole or in part based upon whether the
Indemnifying Party has paid all or only part of the Indemnitee's Liability, as
to any events or circumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have
any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-Party Claim against any
claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-Party Claim or against any other
Person. Such Indemnitee will cooperate with such Indemnifying Party in a
reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in
prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim.

(q) Not Applicable To Taxes. Except for Section 9.04(b) and as otherwise
specifically provided herein, this Agreement, including Section 1.06(a) and
Section 1.06(b), will not apply to Taxes (which are covered by the Tax Matters
Agreement).

9.07 Exclusive Remedy. (a) From and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive
remedy of a Party with respect to any and all claims relating to this
Agreement, the Galleria Business, the Galleria Assets, the Galleria
Liabilities, the Excluded Liabilities, the Galleria Entities or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, Fraud and except for seeking specific performance or
other equitable relief to require a Party to perform its obligations under
this Agreement to the extent permitted hereunder and thereunder and except as
otherwise provided herein or in any Ancillary Agreement) will be pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX or, in the case of
indemnification claims for Taxes addressed in the Tax Matters Agreement, the
Tax Matters Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each Party hereby
waives, from and after the Closing, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action (other than pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Article IX and the Tax Matters Agreement and other than claims of, or
causes of action arising from, Fraud and except for seeking specific
performance or other equitable relief to require a Party to perform its
obligations under this Agreement to the extent permitted hereunder and except
as otherwise provided in any Ancillary Agreement) that such Party or its
Affiliates may have against the other Party or any of its Affiliates, or their
respective directors, officers and employees, arising under or based upon any
applicable Laws and arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Group and Acquiror Group with
respect to any and all indemnification claims for Taxes addressed in the Tax
Matters Agreement will be as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement.

X. MISCELLANEOUS

10.01 Non-Survival of Representations and Warranties. Except as provided in
the next sentence, none of the representations, warranties and agreements in
this Agreement will survive the Closing. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, for purposes of the indemnification obligations set forth in Section
9.02 and Section 9.03, (a) the agreements contained in this Agreement in
Article II and Article X that by their terms are to be performed in whole or
in part after the Closing will survive the Closing until they have been
performed in accordance with their terms, (b) the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.15 and Section 4.14 will survive until the
one year anniversary of the Closing (the items in clauses (a) and (b),
collectively, the "Surviving Transaction Agreement Items") and (c) the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.11 and Section 4.12 will
survive as provided in the Tax Matters Agreement.

10.02 Expenses. (u) General Rule. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, including in Sections 1.09, 2.15, 5.02 and this 10.02, or any of
the Ancillary Agreements, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will be paid by the Party
incurring such fees or expenses.

(v) Antitrust Filing Fees. Acquiror will be responsible for and pay any
requisite filing fee in respect of any notification submitted pursuant any
Antitrust Laws, including the HSR Act.

(w) Printing Expenses. Acquiror and Parent will share equally the fees and

preparation of the filings with the Commission contemplated by Section 5.08.

(x) Galleria Indebtedness Expenses. Acquiror will reimburse Parent for all
costs and expenses incurred by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with the Galleria Financing, including any rating agency evaluation or
maintenance fees, commitment fees, ticking fees, upfront fees, closing fees
and administrative agent fees, interest payments made prior to the Closing
Date (in respect of any monies borrowed under the Galleria Credit Facility
prior to the Closing and placed into an escrow or similar account as
contemplated by the Galleria Commitment Letter), professional fees and
expenses, and other fees paid pursuant to fee letters and arrangements entered
into in connection with the Galleria Credit Facility (the "Galleria Debt
Expenses").

(y) Expenses Associated With Transition Arrangements And Other Certain Matters
Related To Preparation For Closing. This Section 10.02(e) governs the
allocation of responsibility for costs and expenses undertaken by the Parent
Group in connection with the activities contemplated by Section 5.18 (Removal
of Tangible Assets), 5.21(d) (Execution of Transition Plan), 5.21(f) (Set-Up
of UPC/EAN Codes, etc.), 5.21(g) (Control of Galleria Entity Structuring) and
Section 5.27 (Facilities Split Plan) (the "Covered Expenses").

(v) General Principles. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, responsibility for the Covered Expenses will be apportioned between
Parent and Acquiror as follows:

(A) costs and expenses that are incurred by Parent Group for the purpose of
optimizing the Parent Group's retained operations as a result of the
divestiture of the Galleria Business for the post-closing benefit of the
Parent Group, such as for example the elimination of stranded overhead
resources at facilities other than the Galleria Facilities, the optimization
of facilities to be retained by the Parent Group and the removal of Excluded
Assets from Galleria Facilities, will be 100% the responsibility of Parent;

(B) costs and expenses that are incurred by Parent Group, at the direction of
or in consultation with the Acquiror Group, for the purpose of benefitting the
future operations of the Galleria Group or the Acquiror Group (beyond assets
that constitute Galleria Assets or employees who are In-Scope Employees, in
each case, as of the date hereof), such as for example by adding ongoing
capability or functionality to the Galleria Business that does not exist as of
the date of this Agreement, acquiring new facilities, hiring individuals for
newly created positions or non-transferring functions such as sales force
employees, moving employees to new locations or shipping and installing
Galleria Assets in new locations, will be 100% the responsibility of Acquiror;
and

(C) costs and expenses that are incurred by Parent Group for the purpose of
facilitating the transaction, such as for example the removal of the tangible
Galleria Assets contemplated by Section 5.18, the implementation of the Split
Plan Agreement contemplated by Section 5.27, and the expense contemplated in
connection with preparing to deliver the anticipated business services under
the Transition Services Agreement and/or the migration of the services to the
systems of Acquiror, will be shared 50%/50% between Parent and Acquiror.

(vi) Attached as Schedule 10.02 is a preliminary listing of activities
contemplated for the transition process and the currently contemplated
division of responsibility for the costs and expenses associated therewith.
Each of the Parties acknowledges that the ultimate activities to be
undertaken, and allocation of responsibilities, may be subject to change based
on the results of the transition planning discussions contemplated by Section
5.21(a), but that Schedule 10.02 is meant to be a good faith indication of
their intent.

(z) Mechanics of Reimbursement Payments. Any reimbursement amount that may be
payable in respect of Section 10.02(d) or Section 10.02(e) will be effected in
the following manner: (i) to the extent Covered Expenses or Galleria Debt
Expenses that would be the responsibility of Acquiror are incurred by any
member of the Galleria Group, were outstanding as of the Cut-Off Date and
remain outstanding as of the Business Transfer Time (such as accounts payable
or accrued expenses), such Covered Expenses and Galleria Debt Expenses will
remain as outstanding Liabilities of the Galleria Group and will not be taken
into account in the calculation of Cut-Off Date Working Capital, as
contemplated by the definition of Cut-Off Date Working Capital, and (ii) in
respect of any other Covered Expenses or Galleria Debt Expenses that would be
the responsibility of Acquiror, the Recapitalization Amount will be increased
by such amount of Covered Expenses or Galleria Debt Expenses (and, in respect
of any such Covered Expenses or Galleria Debt Expenses that have not been
determined as of the 10th Business Day prior to the Closing Date (including in
respect of costs that have been incurred but not invoiced), the
Recapitalization Amount will be an adjusted by an amount equal to Parent's
good faith estimate of such undetermined costs). Parent will not be required
to incur any costs after the Closing that constitute Covered Expenses for
which the Acquiror has any responsibility hereunder except to the extent that
the Parties agree on such costs prior to the Closing (in which case, the
Recapitalization Amount will be increased by an amount equal to such agreed-
upon future costs).

(aa) Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is terminated,
the reimbursement contemplated by Section 10.02(f) will be paid by Acquiror to
Parent no later than five Business Days following such termination; provided,
however, that Acquiror will have no obligation to reimburse Parent for such
fees and expenses if this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant to
Section 8.01(d)(i).

(bb) No Post-Closing Payments. In no case will any reimbursement payments
contemplated by this Section 10.02 take place after the Closing. Each of the
Parties will settle all such payments at or prior to the Closing (whether
effected through the calculation of the Recapitalization Amount or otherwise)
as provided in this Section 10.02.

(cc) Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.02,
responsibility for Taxes will be allocated as set forth in the Tax Matters
Agreement.

(dd) Efforts to Minimize Shared Costs. Each of the Parties will cooperate in
good faith with the other Parties to minimize any costs and expenses that, by
operation of this Agreement would not be borne solely by such Party (it being
understood that this provision will not be deemed to require the Parties to
proceed more slowly towards consummating the transactions contemplated hereby
if doing so would reduce costs and expenses).

10.03 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including
any related annexes, schedules and exhibits, as well as any other agreements
and documents referred to herein and therein, will together constitute the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and will supersede all prior negotiations, agreements and
understandings of the Parties of any nature, whether oral or written, with
respect to such subject matter, including the Confidentiality Agreement, which
is hereby terminated and of no further force or effect, subject to Section
8.03. If there is a conflict between any provision of this Agreement and a
provision of any Ancillary Agreement, the provision of this Agreement will
control unless specifically provided otherwise in this Agreement.

10.04 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. (w) The validity,
interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the Laws
of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of Laws provisions
thereof that would cause the Laws of another state to apply. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, and without limiting anything set forth in
Section 10.17, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or
support any suit, action or other proceeding (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any Debt Financing Source in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any related financing), including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Galleria Financing or Acquiror Financing or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than any New York State court or
federal court sitting in the County of New York and the Borough Manhattan (and
appellate courts thereof). The parties hereto further agree that all of the
provisions of this Section 10.04 relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply
to any suit, action or other proceeding referenced in the preceding sentence.

(x) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably (i)
submits and consents to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal
courts of the State of Delaware for itself and in respect of its property in
the event that any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court and (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any other
court. Subject to compliance with the provisions of Section 10.15, if
applicable, each of the Parties irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and
agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
dispute arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby in the state and federal courts of the State of Delaware, or that any
such dispute brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient or
improper forum. The Parties further agree that the mailing by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested, of any process required by any such
court will constitute valid and lawful service of process against them,
without necessity for service by any other means provided by statute or rule
of court.

(y) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY (INCLUDING AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE). EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS,
(II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III)
IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 10.04(c).

10.06 Amendments and Waivers. (c) This Agreement may be amended and any
provision of this Agreement may be waived; provided, however, that any such
amendment or waiver will become and remain binding upon a Party only if such
amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by such Party. No
course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this
Agreement will be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of
this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any Party under or by reason of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Sections 10.04, 10.07, 10.08, 10.17 and this Section 10.06 (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver or
termination of such provision would modify the substance of any of the
foregoing provisions) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a
manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect to any Debt Financing Source
without the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Source.

(d) No delay or failure in exercising any right, power or remedy hereunder
will affect or operate as a waiver thereof; nor will any single or partial
exercise thereof or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such
a right, power or remedy preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or remedy. Except and solely to the extent set forth in Section
9.07, the rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive of
any rights or remedies that any Party would otherwise have.

10.07 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is solely for the benefit
of the Parties (and with respect to Sections 10.04, 10.06, 10.08, 10.17 and
this Section 10.07, the Debt Financing Sources) and does not confer on third
parties (including any employees of any member of the Parent Group or the
Acquiror Group) any remedy, claim, reimbursement, claim of action or other
right in addition to those existing without reference to this Agreement;
provided, however, that this Section 10.07 does not limit any rights of Parent
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of Article
VI.

10.08 Assignability. No Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties
under this Agreement without the written consent of the other Party, except
that a Party may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this Agreement
to a member of its Group, provided that (a) such Person agrees in writing to
be bound by the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement and (b) such
assignment or delegation will not relieve any Party of its indemnification
obligations or other obligations under this Agreement and (c) after the
Closing, the Acquiror may assign its rights or delegate its duties under this
Agreement to any lender party to the Acquiror Commitment Letter as collateral
security, unless, in each case, Parent determines, in its sole discretion,
that such assignment or delegation would materially increase the likelihood
that the Intended Tax-Free Treatment would not apply to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any attempted assignment or delegation in contravention
of the foregoing will be void.

10.09 Construction. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for
convenience of reference only and are not intended to be a substantive part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever
required by the context, any pronoun used in this Agreement or the Parent
Disclosure Letter or Acquiror Disclosure Letter will include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns,
pronouns, and verbs will include the plural and vice versa. Reference to any
agreement, document or instrument means such agreement, document or instrument
as amended or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the
terms thereof, and if applicable hereof. References in this Agreement to any
document, instrument or agreement (including this Agreement) includes and
incorporates all exhibits, disclosure letters, schedules and other attachments
thereto. Unless the context otherwise requires, any references to an
"Exhibit," "Section" or "Article" will be to an Exhibit, Section or Article to
or of this Agreement, and will be deemed to include any provisions or matters
set forth in any corresponding schedule or section of the Acquiror Disclosure
Letter or Parent Disclosure Letter. The use of the words "include" or
"including" in this Agreement or the Parent Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The use of the word "covenant" or "agreement," when referring to
a covenant or agreement contained herein, will mean "covenant and agreement."
The use of the words "or," "either" or "any" will not be exclusive. "Days"
means "calendar days" unless specified as "Business Days." References to
statutes will include all regulations promulgated thereunder, and references
to statutes or regulations will be construed to include all statutory and
regulatory provisions consolidating, amending or replacing the statute or
regulation as of the date hereof. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Except as
otherwise expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, any provision herein which contemplates the agreement, approval or
consent of, or exercise of any right of, a Party, such Party may give or
withhold such agreement, approval or consent, or exercise such right, in its
sole and absolute discretion, the Parties hereby expressly disclaiming any
implied duty of good faith and fair dealing or similar concept.

10.10 Severability. The Parties agree that (a) the provisions of this
Agreement will be severable in the event that for any reason whatsoever any of
the provisions hereof are invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable, (b) any
such invalid, void or otherwise unenforceable provisions will be replaced by
other provisions which are as similar as possible in terms to such invalid,
void or otherwise unenforceable provisions but are valid and enforceable and
(c) the remaining provisions will remain valid and enforceable to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law.

10.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts
(any one of which need not contain the signatures of more than one Party),
each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
will constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement, and any amendments
hereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or
other electronic transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as
an original agreement and will be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any Party, the other Party will re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to the requesting Party.

10.12 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the performance by Acquiror
and its Affiliates of the employment-related obligations set forth in Article
VI) without proof of actual damages, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which any Party is entitled at Law or in equity. Each Party further
agrees that no other Party or any other Person will be required to obtain,
furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a
condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 10.12, and each
Party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

10.13 Disclosure Letters. There may be included in the Parent Disclosure
Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter items and information that are not
"material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or
agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to affect
the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Matters
reflected in the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure Letter
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
disclosed therein. The Parent Disclosure Letter and the Acquiror Disclosure
Letter set forth items of disclosure with specific reference to the particular
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information in the Parent
Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter, as applicable, relates;
provided, however, that any information set forth in one section of such
disclosure letter will be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.

10.14 Waiver. Acquiror acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
that Jones Day has represented, is representing and will continue to represent
Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements, and that Jones Day will only represent the interests
of Parent in connection with such transactions. Acquiror waives, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, any conflict of interest that it or they may assert
against Jones Day in connection with such representation and agrees not to
challenge Jones Day's representation of Parent with respect to such
transactions or to assert that a conflict of interest exists with respect to
such representation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Acquiror agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that Jones Day may
represent Parent in any litigation, arbitration, mediation or other Action
against or involving Acquiror or any of its Affiliates, arising out of or in
connection with such transactions.

10.15 Dispute Resolution. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement or in any Ancillary Agreement and subject to Section 10.12, the
procedures set forth in this Section 10.15 will govern dispute resolution of
any Direct Claim under Section 9.05 (a "Dispute"). Acquiror, on the one hand,
and Parent, on the other hand, will first refer any such Dispute for
resolution to either the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Acquiror or the
Chief Financial Officer of Parent (or their designees) by delivering to the
other Party a written notice of the referral (a "Dispute Escalation Notice").
Following receipt of a Dispute Escalation Notice, each of the Parties will
cause their respective officer or designee to negotiate in good faith to
resolve the Dispute. If such officers or designees are unable to resolve the
Dispute within 40 Business Days after the date of the Dispute Escalation
Notice, either Party will have the right to commence litigation in accordance
with Section 10.04. The Parties agree that all discussions, negotiations and
other Information exchanged between the Parties during the foregoing
escalation proceedings will be without prejudice to the legal position of a
Party in any subsequent Action and kept confidential and protected against
disclosure.

10.16 Obligations of Affiliates. Each of Parent and Acquiror will cause all of
the members of its Group to comply with their respective obligations or
representations or warranties under this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (whether or not any such members of its Group are parties to this
Agreement or Ancillary Agreements). Parent hereby guarantees to Acquiror the
performance of the other members of the Parent Group of their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements, and
Acquiror hereby guarantees to Parent the performance of the other members of
the Acquiror Group of their respective obligations under this Agreement and
Ancillary Agreements.

10.17 No Recourse Against Debt Financing Sources. Without limiting any other
provision in this Agreement, this Agreement may only be enforced against any
claims or causes of action that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiations, execution or performance of this
Agreement, may only be made against the parties hereto, and no Debt Financing
Source shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the
parties hereto or for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based
on, in respect of or by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith. Parent, SplitCo and Acquiror agree not to, and to cause their
respective Affiliates not to, seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any
claims for breach of this Agreement against or seek to recover monetary
damages in connection with any such asserted breach of this Agreement from any
Debt Financing Source. Parent and SplitCo agree not to, and to cause their
respective Affiliates not to, seek to enforce the Acquiror Commitment Letter
against, make any claims for breach of the Acquiror Commitment Letter against
or seek to recover monetary damages in connection with any such asserted
breach of the Acquiror Commitment Letter from, or otherwise sue in connection
with the Acquiror Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing Sources. Nothing in
this Section 10.17 shall in any way limit or qualify the obligations and
liabilities of the parties to the Galleria Commitment Letter, respectively,
and the Acquiror Commitment Letter to each other or in connection therewith.
