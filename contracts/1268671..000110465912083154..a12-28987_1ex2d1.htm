 **ARTICLE II 
EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE 
CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

 



 

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company
(such shares, collectively, the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares to be cancelled
or converted in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any Dissenting Shares)
shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in cash, without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax. As of the
Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only
represent the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration to be issued
or paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each Share (if any)
owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted
in connection with the Merger into such number of shares of the Surviving
Corporation to maintain its current percentage equity ownership in the Company
after the Closing.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation
and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock

 



      
 

 



 

split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period (excluding, in each case,
normal quarterly cash dividends), merger or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication,
to reflect such change. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section
2.1(d) shall relieve the Company or its Subsidiaries from the obligations
contained in Sections 5.1(b)(iii) and (b)(iv).

 



 

Section 2.2 _Treatment of Options and Other Equity-Based Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") to
purchase Shares granted under any employee or director stock option, stock
purchase or equity compensation plan, arrangement or agreement of the Company
(the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and, in
exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay to each former holder
of any such cancelled Company Stock Option as soon as practicable following
(and in all events no more than three (3) Business Days following) the
Effective Time an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction
for any required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the excess of
the Per Share Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under
such Company Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such
Company Stock Option; _provided_ , that if the exercise price per Share of any
such Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

 



 

(b) Each outstanding share of restricted stock and restricted stock unit
granted under any Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company RSU_ "), whether
vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation
shall pay to each former holder thereof as soon as practicable following (and
in all events no more than three (3) Business Days following) the Effective
Time an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax) equal to the product of (i) the Per Share Merger
Consideration and (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company RSU. With
respect to any Company RSUs that vest in whole or in part based on the
satisfaction of performance criteria, (a) if the applicable performance period
has ended before the Effective Date and the annual audit of the Companys
financial statements has been finalized before the Effective Date, the number
of Company RSUs for which payment shall be made to a holder pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to such Company RSUs shall equal
the number of Company RSUs that vested based on actual performance during such
period, and (b) if the applicable performance period has not ended before the
Effective Date, or if it has ended but the annual audit of the Companys
financial statements has not been finalized before the Effective Date, the
number of Company RSUs for which payment shall be made to a holder pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence shall equal (x) the number of such Company
RSUs that would vest assuming achievement at the applicable target performance
level, (y) multiplied by a fraction (A) the numerator of which is the number
of days from the beginning of the

 



      
 

 



 

applicable performance period to the Effective Date, and (B) the denominator
of which is the number of days in the applicable performance period.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall adopt such resolutions as
may be reasonably required to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.2.

 



 

Section 2.3 _Exchange and Payment_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement (in a
form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a paying agent selected by
Parent (that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to act as agent for
the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") to receive the aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration to
which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make
all payments pursuant to Section 2.1 (such cash being hereinafter referred to
as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article II, except as
provided in this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration
and other amounts contemplated by this Article II.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such
Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates and a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent and
with such other provisions as Parent and the Company shall reasonably agree)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates
in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Upon surrender of a Certificate to the
Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per
Share Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate (subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax), and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Promptly after the
Effective Time and in any event not later than the second Business Day
following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall issue and deliver to each
holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") that delivers to the Paying Agent a letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto (or
such other evidence of transfer reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent), a
check or wire transfer for the amount of cash that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of such Book-Entry Shares,
without such holder being required to

 



      
 

 



 

deliver a Certificate to the Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
then be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(c) If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Share is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.

 



 

(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate or
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
in respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any interest
thereon.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York City time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such
nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Dissenting
Shares) multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount, the "
_DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York
time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its
nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in
immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 



 

(f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(g) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , that any investment of such
cash

 



      
 

 



 

shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the
Payment Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations
to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder (but subject to Section 2.4),
Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount that is
equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be payable to Parent or its designee.

 



 

(h) At any time following the date that is 12 months after the Effective Time,
Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to Parent or
its designee any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
that have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and thereafter such
Persons shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving
Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying
Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 



 

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company Stock Options, Company RSUs
or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of
such Shares pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, unless and until such
holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall
be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such
Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable
only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or
expired, the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a).
The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any Shares, and Parent shall have the right to
control, and make decisions in respect of, and otherwise participate in, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or compromise or settle, or offer to compromise or settle, any
such demands.

initiate, solicit and encourage any inquiry or the making of any proposals or
offers that could constitute Acquisition Proposals, including by way of

Merger Sub any material nonpublic information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that the Company provides to any Person given such access that
was not previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub), and (ii) engage or
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or

discussions or negotiations or any effort or attempt to make any Acquisition
Proposals, including through the waiver or release by the Company, at the sole
discretion of the Special Committee, of any preexisting standstill or similar
agreements with any Persons.

 



 

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this

Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the Company
that was furnished by or on behalf of the Company return or destroy all such
information, (B) immediately terminate access to any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor, the Financing Sources and their respective
Representatives) to any data room maintained by the Company with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (C) until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything in
Section 5.4(b) to the contrary, but subject to the last sentence of this
Section 5.4(c), at any time following the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior
to the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if
the Company receives a written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from
a breach of this Section 5.4) from any Person, the Company and its
Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms and conditions
thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide nonpublic
information and data concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries in response
to a request therefor by such Person if the Company receives from such Person
an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , that the
Company shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material
nonpublic information or data concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that
the Company made available to any Person given such access which was not
previously made available to Parent or Merger Sub), and (ii) the Company and
its Representatives may engage or participate in any discussions or
negotiations with such Person with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, if
and only to the extent that prior to taking any action described in clause (i)
or (ii) above, (x) the Special

 



      
 

 



 

Committee determines in good faith (after the Special Committees consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y)
the Special Committee determines in good faith (after the Special Committees
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal. For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding the occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company may continue to engage in the activities described in Section 5.4(a)
(subject to the limitations and obligations set forth therein) with respect
to, and the restrictions in Section 5.4(b) shall not apply to, any Excluded
Party (for so long as such Person or group of Persons is an Excluded Party),
including with respect to any amended proposal submitted by any Excluded
Parties following the No-Shop Period Start Date, until the date that is 30
days following the No-Shop Period Start Date (the " _Cut-Off Date_ ").

 



 

(d) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons other than Parent or one of its Subsidiaries for
(A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving an acquisition of the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of
the Company whose business constitutes 20% or more of the revenues or assets
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) or (B) the acquisition
in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case
other than the Merger.

 



 

(ii) " _Excluded Party_ " means any Person, group of Persons or group that
includes any Person or group of Persons from whom the Company has received
during the Go-Shop Period a written Acquisition Proposal that the Special
Committee believes in good faith is, or could reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (that did
not result from a material breach by the Company of this Section 5.4) (with
the percentages set forth in the definition of such term changed from 20% to
50%), that the Special Committee has determined in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) (A)
is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking
into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of such proposal and
the Person making the proposal (including the expected timing and likelihood
of consummation, taking into account any governmental and other approval
requirements), and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction more
favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including any revisions to the
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to Section 5.4(h)).

 



 

(iv) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means (A) any confidentiality
agreement to which the Company is a party as of the date hereof or (B) a
confidentiality agreement containing terms that are not materially more
favorable, in the

 



      
 

 



 

aggregate, than the material terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(which confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making or amendment of
an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise contain any standstill or similar
provision).

 



 

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as set forth in this Section 5.4(e), Section 5.4(f), Section 7.1(c)(ii) or
Section 7.1(c)(iv), the Company Board and each committee thereof, including
the Special Committee, shall not:

 



 

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection
with the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, as amended or
supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ");

 



 

(ii) authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, or
propose to authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly
or otherwise), an Acquisition Proposal (any of the foregoing in clauses (i) or
(ii), a " _Change of Recommendation_ ") (it being understood that the Company
Board may elect, upon recommendation of the Special Committee, to take no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, and shall not be considered
to have made a Change in Recommendation; _provided_ , that with respect to the
commencement of an Acquisition Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act, the Company Board may elect, upon recommendation of the Special
Committee, to take no position with respect to such Acquisition Proposal until
the close of business as of the tenth Business Day after commencement of such
proposal, and shall not be considered to have made a Change in
Recommendation); or

 



 

(iii) cause or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or similar definitive agreement, or any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding or agreement in principle, or any other agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement if permitted under Section

relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the time, but not after, the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, but
only after compliance with Section 5.4(h), the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, may (1) take the actions specified in
Section 5.4(e)(i) or Section 7.1(c)(iv) in connection with an event, fact,
development or occurrence that affects the business, assets or operations of
the Company that is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement and thereafter becomes known to the Company Board (an " _Intervening
Event_ ") or (2) effect a Change of Recommendation or take the actions
specified in Section 7.1(c)(ii) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal that
the Special Committee believes in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel) is a Superior Proposal if, in the
case of either clause (1) or (2), the Special

 



      
 

 



 

Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal
counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 5.4
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee
thereof, including the Special Committee, from (i) complying with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), or (ii) making
any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communications to the stockholders of the Company); _provided_ , that any such
disclosure (other than (x) issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement in
accordance with the Exchange Act pending disclosure of its position thereunder
or (y) an express rejection of any Acquisition Proposal or an unqualified
reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Change of
Recommendation, unless the Company Board expressly, publicly and
unconditionally reaffirms the Company Recommendation within four (4) Business
Days following any request by Parent for such reaffirmation (it being agreed
that Parent may make only one such request with respect to any single such
disclosure).

 



 

(g) _Notice_. Within 48 hours following the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each Excluded Party
(to the extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality agreement) and
provide Parent with a description of the status of any discussions with such
Excluded Party and provide to Parent an unredacted copy of any written (or a
written summary of the material terms and conditions of any non-written)
Acquisition Proposal received from such Excluded Party, including any
financing commitments (including redacted fee letters) relating thereto (to
the extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality agreement and such
financing commitments). From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48 hours)
notify Parent if any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(or any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Proposal) is received by, any information or access to the Companys
properties, assets, books or records is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements and,
to the extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality agreement, the
identity of the Person making the proposal or offer) and thereafter shall keep
Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such proposals or
offers (including any amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations; it being understood that the foregoing shall also
apply to any Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments thereto) submitted
by an Excluded Party.

 



 

(h) _Match Right_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Company Board shall not be permitted to effect a Change of

 



      
 

 



 

Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(ii) or
Section 7.1(c)(iv) until it has first taken the following actions:

 



 

(i) If involving or relating to an Intervening Event: (A) the Company Board
shall give Parent at least three (3) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action and a description of the reasons for taking such
action, (B) upon Parents request, the Company shall discuss with Parent, and
cause its financial and legal advisors and other Representatives to discuss
with Parent, in good faith and in reasonable detail the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such Intervening Event during such notice period
and provide all information reasonably requested by Parent concerning such
facts and circumstances to facilitate Parents evaluation of whether to
improve the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Equity Financing
Commitments, the Debt Financing Commitment and the Limited Guarantee in such a
manner that would obviate the need for the taking of such action, and (C)
following the end of such three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board
shall then have considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement, the
Equity Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing Commitment and the Limited
Guarantee proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(ii) If involving or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal:
(A) such Acquisition Proposal shall not have resulted from a breach of Section
5.4(b) and the Company shall then comply with Section 5.4(c) with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal, (B) the Company Board shall then determine in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (C) the
Company shall then provide a written notice to Parent (a " _Notice of Superior
Proposal_ ") that the Company intends to take such action and describing the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis for
such action, including with such Notice of Superior Proposal a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction document(s) related to the Superior Proposal
(including, to the extent not prohibited by any applicable confidentiality
agreement, the identity of the Person making the proposal), (D) during the
three (3) Business Day period following Parents receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors and other Representatives, to negotiate with Parent (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitments, the Debt
Financing Commitment and the Limited Guarantee so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, and (E) following the end of such
three (3) Business Day period, the Company Board shall then have determined in
good faith, taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement,
the Equity Financing Commitments, the Debt Financing Commitment and the
Limited Guarantee proposed in writing by Parent to the Company in response to
the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal
giving rise to the Notice of Superior Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal. Any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply again with

 



      
 

 



 

the requirements of this Section 5.4(h)(ii) ( _provided_ , that references to
the three (3) Business Day period above shall be deemed references to a 48
hour period).

 



 

Section 5.5 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders  Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall, with the assistance of Parent, prepare the Proxy
Statement and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of Parent
and Merger Sub will furnish to the Company the information relating to it
required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Company agrees that at
the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company and at the time of the
Company Stockholders Meeting, (i) the Proxy Statement will comply in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) the Proxy Statement,
taken as a whole, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; _provided_ , that the Company makes no
representation or warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on
behalf of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein. Parent and Merger Sub agree that the
information supplied by either of them or any of their Affiliates for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the date of mailing to
stockholders of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; _provided_ , that Parent and Merger Sub make no
representation or warranty with respect to statements included or incorporated
by reference in the Proxy Statement based on information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company or any of its Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve all SEC comments with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement
which shall have become false or misleading. The Company shall as promptly as
practicable notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of (and provide copies
to Parent and Merger Sub) any comments or other correspondence from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and any request by the SEC for any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or for additional information.
Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or making any other required
filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding
to any comments or other correspondence from the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall in good faith consider for
inclusion in such document or response any reasonable comments proposed by
Parent. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed
promptly after the date the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments
thereon or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall (i)
take all action necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") and (ii) except
to the extent that the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee, shall have effected a Change in Recommendation in
accordance with Section 5.4(e), include in the Proxy Statement the Company
Recommendation ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall be permitted
to delay or postpone convening the Stockholders Meeting (but not beyond the
Termination Date) if in the good faith judgment of the Special Committee
(after consultation with its legal counsel), failure to effect such delay or
postponement would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law) and take all commercially reasonable action to solicit proxies approving
the adoption of this Agreement and to otherwise obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval.

 



 

Section 5.6 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the earlier termination of
this Agreement, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall, and shall use its
reasonable best effects to cause its Subsidiaries and its Representatives to,
(i) afford to Parent, Merger Sub and each of their respective Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours, consistent with applicable
Law, to its officers, employees, properties, offices, other facilities and
books, contracts and records, and (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished all
financial, operating and other data and information as Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Representatives may reasonably request (it being agreed,
however, that the foregoing shall not permit Parent or its officers, employees
or representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or consultation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business
or operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any
significant interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the employees
of the Company or its Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to
disclose information where such access or disclosure would (x) breach any
Contract with any third party, (y) constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the
attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company or (z) violate any
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , the parties hereto shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by
providing redacted forms of such information) to the extent doing so would not
be reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such Contract or Law,
or be reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect
to such information.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat, and will use reasonable
efforts to ensure that its respective Representatives hold and treat, in
confidence all documents and information concerning the Company and its
Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the
Nondisclosure Agreement, dated October 5, 2012, between Siris Capital Group,
LLC and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which

 



      
 

 



 

Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms. The Company hereby consents to include the Financing Sources
and other potential financing sources as permitted "Representatives" under the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) Parent only discloses
"Confidential Information" (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) to the Financing Sources or such other financing sources for the
purpose of obtaining equity or debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) Parent shall not, pursuant to a written
agreement or otherwise, engage any of the Financing Sources or such other
financing sources on an exclusive basis or in a manner that would otherwise
prevent or inhibit a third party from obtaining equity or debt financing from
the Financing Sources or such other financing sources on terms consistent with
other similar financings; and (iii) the provisions applicable to
"Representatives" in the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to the
Financing Sources or such other financing sources as if such Persons were
originally included as "Representatives" thereunder. Parent shall notify the
Company promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) in writing if
Parent discloses any Confidential Information to any Financing Sources or such
other financing sources that are not identified as "Specified Financing
Sources" in the letter agreement between the Company and Siris Capital Group,
LLC, dated as of November 1, 2012 (as amended on November 23, 2012, November
27, 2012, November 29, 2012 and December 3, 2012) and shall disclose in
writing to the Company the identity of such Financing Sources or other
financing sources; _provided_ , that no such notice shall be required in
connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing to other financing
sources whose commitments are to become effective simultaneously with or
following the initial funding of the Debt Financing, provided that such other
financing sources have agreed to customary confidentiality undertakings in
connection with such syndication.

applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest practicable date,
including: (i) causing the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations

Form pursuant to the HSR Act and (ii) prepare and file as promptly as

by any party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities and as
to the contents of all communications with such Governmental Entities. In
particular, to the extent permitted by Law or a Governmental Entity, no party
will make any notification in relation to the transactions contemplated
hereunder without first providing the other party with a copy of such
notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account of

(including, if permitted by applicable Law, requesting early termination of
such waiting periods) and (ii) obtain all other approvals and any other
consents required to be obtained in order for the parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be required to (i) proffer to,
or agree to, sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
encumber or hold separate and agree to sell, divest, lease, license, transfer,
dispose of or otherwise encumber before or after the Effective Time, any
material assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interest therein of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates (or to consent to any sale, divestiture, lease, license, transfer,
disposition or other encumbrance by the Company of any of its material assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interest therein or
to any agreement by the Company to take any of the foregoing actions) or to
agree to any material change (including without limitation, through a
licensing arrangement) or restriction on, or other impairment of Parents
ability to own or operate, any such assets, licenses, operations, rights,
product lines, businesses or interests therein or Parents ability to vote,
transfer, receive dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with
respect to the stock of the Surviving Corporation, (ii) take any other action

material consideration by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with such waivers or consents).

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially or competitively sensitive
information and materials of a party will be provided to the other party on an
outside counsel-only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a version in
which the commercial or competitively sensitive information has been redacted
available to the other party.

 



 

(h) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust Law_ " means the Sherman Act,
as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other Laws that are

Section 5.8 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any current or former employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company Employee_ ") may
have under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and each of its Subsidiaries, for a period commencing at the Effective Time
and ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain the severance-related
provisions of existing Company Plans and to provide 100% of the severance
payments and benefits required thereunder to be provided any Company Employee
(other than the Excluded Employees) terminated during that 12-month period.

 



 

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Parent
and a Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its Subsidiaries, for the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, to maintain for any Company Employee
(other than the Excluded Employees) (i) subject to Section 5.8(a) above, cash
compensation levels (such term to include salary, bonus opportunities and
commissions) that are each no less favorable in the aggregate than, and (ii)
benefits (including the costs thereof to Company Plan participants) provided
under Company Plans that in the aggregate are no less favorable than, the
overall cash compensation levels and benefits (including the costs thereof to
Company Plan participants) maintained for and provided to such Company
Employees (other than the Excluded Employees) immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give the Company Employees full credit for purposes
of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of
benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plans or for purposes of
any equity-based awards), under any employee compensation, incentive, and
benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements
maintained for the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective
Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company
Employees service with the Company, its Subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to each Parent
Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA),
Parent and its Subsidiaries shall (i) cause there to be waived any pre-
existing condition or eligibility limitations and (ii) give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Company Employees
under similar plans maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed in writing
between Parent and a Company Employee or as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, Parent will honor, and will cause its Subsidiaries to honor, their
respective obligations under the Company Plans in accordance with the terms of
such Company Plan.

 



 

Section 5.9 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Board of Directors
(in the case of the Company Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of
the Special Committee) or Board of Managers, as applicable, shall take all
action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent shall
promptly notify each other of (a) any notice or other communication received
by such party from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
Parent, Merger Sub, Holdings, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) any Action commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby or (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice; _provided_ _further_ ,
that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to clause (c) shall not constitute
a failure of a condition to the Merger set forth in Article VI, except to the
extent that the underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing
alone constitute such a failure. The parties agree and acknowledge that,
except with respect to clause (c) of the first sentence of this Section 5.10,
the Companys compliance or failure of compliance with this Section 5.10 shall
not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the condition
referred to in Section 6.3(b) shall have been satisfied.

 



 

Section 5.11 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Company Charter and
Company Bylaws in effect as of the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof, each present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer or
director of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "),
against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines
and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and
disbursements incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director, fiduciary or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) matters existing or
occurring, or services performed by an Indemnified Party at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for
the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (x) the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (y) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. In the event of
any such Action, (A) each Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement
of expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the
Company Charter and Company Bylaws as at the date hereof, _provided_ , that
any Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only
to the extent required by the DGCL or the Company Charter or Company Bylaws,
to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not
entitled to indemnification, (B) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened Action (and in which indemnification could be sought
by such Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents, and (C) the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of
any such matter.

 



 

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or in
any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

 



 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries or cause to be provided substitute policies
or purchase or cause the Surviving Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy,"
in either case of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than such policy
with respect to matters arising on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Effective Time, Parent shall not be required to pay
with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any one policy year
annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as

 



      
 

 



 

much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail policy" and
the coverage thereunder costs more than 300% of such last annual premium, the
Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of coverage that can
be obtained for 300% of such last annual premium. At the Companys option, the
Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail
policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount and scope) providing
substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters arising on or before
the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that such prepaid "tail policy" shall not
have a one-time premium in excess of 300% of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the coverage required to be
obtained pursuant hereto. If such prepaid "tail policy" has been obtained by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause such policy to be
maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and cause all
obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation. If such
prepaid "tail policy" is cancelled for any reason prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall obtain a replacement policy
for the remaining term of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are not less advantageous in the aggregate than the
cancelled policy, on the terms set forth in this Section 5.11(c).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action (whether
arising before, at or after the Effective Time) requiring indemnification
under this Section 5.11 is instituted against any Indemnified Party on or
prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this
Section 5.11 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
Action.

 



 

(e) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant
to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
survive the consummation of the Merger and, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement that may be to the contrary, expressly are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 



 

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

 



 

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall,
and shall be permitted to, take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each Person who is a director or

 



      
 

 



 

officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 5.13 _Public Announcements_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, (i) shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
(ii) shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement
prior to such consultation and review, in each case except as may be permitted
pursuant to this Agreement, or as may be required by applicable Law, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with the NYSE.
Parent and the Company agree that the press release announcing the execution
and delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of the Sponsor and the
Company.

 



 

Section 5.14 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

Section 5.15 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing on
the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments (taking into
account the anticipated timing of the Marketing Period), including using its
reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements on the terms
and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, (ii) satisfy, or cause
the satisfaction of, on a timely basis all conditions in the Financing
Commitments and the definitive agreements for the Financing, (iii) consummate
the Financing (including by instructing the Financing Sources to provide such
Financing) on or prior to the date on which the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to Section 1.2, and (iv) enforce its rights under the Financing
Commitments.

 



 

(b) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions and from the sources contemplated in the Financing Commitments,
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative financing
in a like amount and on like terms as promptly as practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to obtain alternative
financing on terms less favorable to Parent in any material respect than those
set forth in the Financing Commitments.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall have the right from time to
time to amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its
rights under, or add lenders, co-investors, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement, to the Financing Commitments;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such amendment, replacement, supplement,
modification, waiver or addition shall not, without the prior written consent
of the Company (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing unless such
reduction is matched by an increase in the Equity Financing, (ii) modify or
expand upon any of the conditions precedent to the Financing from that set
forth in the Financing Commitments in a manner that would delay or prevent the
Closing or make funding

 



      
 

 



 

materially less likely to occur, (iii) be reasonably expected to prevent,
impede or delay the availability of the Financing or (iv) adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to enforce their respective rights under the
Financing Commitments.

 



 

(d) To the extent Parent obtains alternative financing pursuant to paragraph
(b) above, or amends, replaces, supplements, modifies or waives any of the
Financing or adds lenders, co-investors, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities pursuant to paragraph (c) above,
references to the "Financing," "Financing Commitments" and "Financing Sources"
(and other like terms in this Agreement) shall be deemed to refer to such
alternative financing, or the Financing as so amended, replaced, supplemented,
modified, waived or added.

 



 

(e) Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a timely basis of the
status of Parents efforts to obtain the Financing and to satisfy the
conditions thereof, including advising and updating the Company, in a
reasonable level of detail, with respect to status, proposed closing date and
material terms of the definitive documentation related to the Financing,
providing copies of then-current drafts of the credit agreement and other
primary definitive documents, and giving the Company prompt notice of any
material change (adverse or otherwise) with respect to the Financing. Without
limiting the foregoing, Parent shall notify the Company promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days) if at any time prior to the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) any Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason (or if
any Person attempts or purports to terminate any Financing Commitment, whether
or not such attempted or purported termination is valid);

 



 

(ii) Parent obtains knowledge of any breach or default or any threatened
breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without due
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Commitment;

 



 

(iii) Parent receives any communication (written or oral) from any Person with
respect to any (A) actual or threatened breach, default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Commitments or (B) dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Financing Commitments;

 



 

(iv) any Financing Source refuses to provide or expresses to Parent (orally or
in writing) an intent to refuse to provide all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the terms set forth therein; or

 



 

(v) Parent, for any reason, no longer believes in good faith that it will be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms described in
the Financing Commitments.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be under any obligation to
disclose any information that is subject to attorney-client or similar
privilege if Parent shall have used reasonable best efforts to disclose such
information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to
cause its Subsidiaries to provide, to Parent all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with obtaining the Financing, including:

 



 

(i) making the Companys senior officers available to participate in a
reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the Financing Sources and senior management of the Company), presentations,
road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating
agencies;

 



 

(ii) reasonably cooperating with the Financing Sources evaluation of the
Companys assets for the purpose of establishing collateral arrangements;

 



 

(iii) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of Parent and the
Financing Sources, including reasonably assisting with the preparation of
rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda, lender presentations,
projections, pro formas and similar documents and providing such financial and
other information to the extent available as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith;

 



 

(iv) if the Closing has not occurred (A) on or prior to March 31, 2013,
furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at the end of, and
related statements of income and cash flows of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 (such financial
statements, the " _2012 Audited Financial Statements_ ") and (B) on or prior
to May 15, 2013, furnishing Parent and the Financing Sources with the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries as at
the end of, and related statements of income and cash flows of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for, the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2013 (such financial
statements, the " _Q1 2013 Unaudited Financial Statements_ ");

 



 

(v) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consents customary for
financings similar to the Financing and assist Parent with obtaining customary
legal opinions;

 



 

(vi) executing and delivering such documents, instruments, certificates or
information, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the Debt
Financing (including without limitation (A) documents requested by Parent or
its Financing Sources relating to the repayment of the existing Indebtedness
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the release of related Liens,
including customary payoff letters and (to the extent required) evidence that
notice of such repayment has been timely delivered to the holders of such debt
and (B) all documentation and other information required by bank regulatory
authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act and requested in writing at
least 10 days prior to the Closing), using commercially reasonable efforts to
deliver such officers certificates as are customary in financings of such
type (including without limitation a certificate of the chief financial
officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters in the form set forth

Section 7.1(c)(ii) or Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii)(A) or Section
7.1(d)(ii)(B), in each such case, prior to the Cut-Off Date, then the Company
Termination Fee means an amount in cash equal to $8,019,250.

 



 

Any payments required to be made under this Section 7.3(b) shall be made by
wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by

shall pay the Company an amount in cash equal to $32,076,750 (the " _Reverse
Termination Fee_ "), it being understood that in no event shall Parent or
Merger Sub be required to pay the Reverse Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Payment of the Reverse Termination Fee, if applicable, shall be made
by wire transfer of same day funds to the account or accounts designated by
the Company promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after
the date of such termination. In the event that this Agreement is terminated
and a Reverse Termination Fee is payable under this Section 7.3(c), the
Companys receipt of the Reverse Termination Fee pursuant to this Section
7.3(c) (and any amounts payable under Section 7.3(f)) shall be (i) deemed to
be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by the Company, its Subsidiaries and each of their respective former, current
and future Representatives, stockholders, Affiliates and

 



      
 

 



 

assignees and each former, current or future Representative, stockholder,
Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Company
Parties_ ") in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for the termination giving rise to the payment of
such Reverse Termination Fee, and (ii) the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company against Parent, Merger Sub, Sponsor, the Financing Sources and each of
their respective former, current and future Representatives, stockholders,

failure to perform hereunder, and no Parent Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
that this Agreement is terminated and a Reverse Termination Fee is payable
under this Section 7.3(c), this Section 7.3(c) shall not limit the ability of
the Company to recover indemnification under Section 5.15(g)(iii). For the
avoidance of doubt, the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee is intended to
serve as a cap on the maximum aggregate liability of Parent, Merger Sub and
any Parent Party under this Agreement in the event Parent and Merger Sub fail
to effect the Closing in accordance with Section 1.2 of this Agreement or
otherwise breach this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder; _provided_ ,
that the Reverse Termination Fee shall not serve as a cap on any
indemnification owed by Parent to any Company Parties under Section 5.11 or

amount of the Reverse Termination Fee; _provided_ , _further_ , that any costs
or expenses of the Company that are actually reimbursed by Parent or Merger
Sub pursuant to this Agreement (including any expenses reimbursed pursuant to
Section 5.15(g)(ii)) shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Reverse
Termination Fee that becomes due and payable under this Section 7.3(c).

 



 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)
(or is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) at a time when
the Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii)), then the
Company shall pay Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds) the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants incurred by Parent and Merger Sub
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including any filing fees actually paid by Parent under Section
5.7(b)) in an amount not to exceed $5,346,000 (the " _Parent Expenses_ ");
_provided_ , that any payment of the Parent Expenses shall not affect Parents
right to receive the Company Termination Fee under Section 7.3(b), but shall
reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Company Termination Fee that becomes
due and payable under Section 7.3(b).

 



 

(e) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(i) due to the failure to satisfy the conditions set
forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c) (but solely, in the case of Section
6.1(b), due to a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition , in each case, under the
HSR Act), or (ii) by the Company or Parent pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to Section 7.1(b)(ii) due to a final, nonappealable judgment, order,
injunction, ruling or decree issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Entity, or other final, nonappealable legal restraint,
injunction or prohibition, in each case, preventing the consummation of the
Merger under the HSR Act, and in the case of either clause (i) or (ii), the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other than the conditions
set forth in Section 6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c) (but solely, in the case of
Section 6.1(b), due to a temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued by any court of competent
jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition, in each case, under the
HSR Act) and those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at
Closing but which conditions would reasonably be expected to be satisfied if
the Closing were the date of such termination) have been satisfied, then
Parent shall pay the Company (by wire transfer of immediately available funds)
the reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel, accountants,
investment bankers, experts and consultants incurred by the Company in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount not to exceed $5,346,000 (the " _Company Expenses_ ");
_provided_ , that in the event that this Agreement is terminated and Company
Expenses are payable under this Section 7.3(e), this Section 7.3(e) shall not
limit the ability of the Company to recover indemnification under Section
5.15(g)(iii) or the Reverse Termination Fee under Section 7.3(c); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the case of the Reverse Termination Fee, any payment of
the Company Expenses shall reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, any Reverse
Termination Fee that becomes due under Section 7.3(c).

 



 

(f) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, (i) if the Company fails promptly to pay any amounts
due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, the Company shall pay to Parent its
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts due pursuant
to this Section 7.3 from the date such payment was required to be made until
the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made and (ii)
if Parent fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3,
and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company commences a suit that
results in a judgment against Parent for the amounts set forth in this Section
7.3, Parent shall pay to the Company its costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3 from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime lending rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the

amounts reduce the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of

had never been contained herein; _provided_ , that the parties intend that the
remedies and limitations thereon (including limitations on the right to
specifically enforce the terms hereof) shall be construed as an integral
provision of this Agreement and that such remedies and limitations shall not
be severable in any manner that increases the liability of any party
(including any Parent Party) or the obligations of any Parent Party hereunder.

which corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporation Law
(as amended, the " _DGCL_ ").

 



 

 _ARTICLE FOUR_

 



 

The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation has authority to

$0.01 per share.

 



 

 _ARTICLE FIVE_

 _ARTICLE SIX_

 



 

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by statute, the
board of directors of the Corporation is expressly authorized to make, alter
or repeal the bylaws of the Corporation.

 



 

 _ARTICLE SEVEN_

 



 

Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of Delaware,
as the bylaws of the Corporation may provide. The books of the Corporation

      
 

 



 

may be kept outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may be
designated from time to time by the board of directors or in the bylaws of the
Corporation. Election of directors need not be by written ballot unless the
bylaws of the Corporation so provide.

 



 

 _ARTICLE EIGHT_

 



 

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is
authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses to)
directors, officers, employees and agents (and any other persons to which
Delaware law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through bylaw
provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders
or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and
advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, subject only to
limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with
respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and
others.

 



 

No director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation
or any stockholder for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, except for any matter in respect of which such director shall be
liable under Section 174 of the DGCL or any amendment thereto or shall be
liable by reason that, in addition to any and all other requirements for such
liability, such director (1) shall have breached the directors duty of
loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (2) shall have acted in a
manner involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law or, in
failing to act, shall have acted in a manner involving intentional misconduct
or a knowing violation of law, or (3) shall have derived an improper personal
benefit. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize the further elimination
or limitation of the liability of a director, the liability of a director of
the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted
by the DGCL, as so amended.

 



 

Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is in any way involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), including any appeal therefrom, by reason of the
fact that he or she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or a direct
or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director or officer of another entity or enterprise,
or was a director or officer of a foreign or domestic Corporation which was a
predecessor corporation of the Corporation or of another entity or enterprise
at the request of such predecessor corporation, shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Corporation, and the Corporation shall advance all expenses
incurred by any such person in defense of any such proceeding prior to its
final determination, to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. In any
proceeding against the Corporation to enforce these rights, such person shall
be presumed to be entitled to indemnification and the Corporation shall have
the burden of proving that such person has not met the standards of conduct
for permissible indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Any person serving as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or

      
 

 



 

other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity interests are owned by the
Corporation shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at
the request of the Corporation. The rights to indemnification and advancement
of expenses conferred by this ARTICLE EIGHT shall be presumed to have been
relied upon by the directors and officers of the Corporation in serving or
continuing to serve the Corporation and shall be enforceable as contract
rights. Said rights shall not be exclusive of any other rights to which those
seeking indemnification may otherwise be entitled. The Corporation may, upon
written demand presented by a director or officer of the Corporation or of a
direct or indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, or by a person serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director or officer of another entity or
enterprise, enter into contracts to provide such persons with specified rights
to indemnification, which contracts may confer rights and protections to the
maximum extent permitted by the DGCL, as amended and in effect from time to
time.

 



 

If a claim under this ARTICLE EIGHT is not paid in full by the Corporation
within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expenses
of prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other
than an action brought to enforce the right to be advanced expenses incurred
in defending any proceeding prior to its final disposition where the required
undertaking, if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant
has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the DGCL
for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the
claimant shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification and the
Corporation shall have the burden of proving that the claimant has not met the
standards of conduct for permissible indemnification set forth in the DGCL.

 



 

If the DGCL is hereafter amended to permit the Corporation to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Corporation to provide
prior to such amendment, the indemnification rights conferred by this ARTICLE
EIGHT shall be broadened to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so
amended.

 



 

 _ARTICLE NINE_

 



 

The Corporation expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of the
DGCL.

 



 

 _ARTICLE TEN_

 



 

The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any
provision contained in this certificate of incorporation in the manner now or
hereafter prescribed herein and by the laws of the State of Delaware, and all
rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.
