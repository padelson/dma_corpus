Corporation shall take all necessary action such that, at the Effective
Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read

amended as provided therein or by applicable Law (subject to _Section_ __ _
5.9_).

of further action by the Company or any other person, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals

 prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, shall
continue as the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly elected,
designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal
in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation

this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., local time, on the
third Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the applicable
conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Latham and Watkins
LLP, 200 Clarendon St., Boston, Massachusetts 02116, unless another time, date
or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing), the Closing shall occur on the earlier to occur of (a) a date
during the Marketing Period specified by Parent in its sole and absolute
discretion on no less than three Business Days notice to the Company and (b)

provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger
shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties
and specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time at which the
Merger becomes effective hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

 

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of_ _Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled or converted
pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive $86.05 per Share (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable net to the holder in cash, without
interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as
provided in Section 2.5, upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2_. As of the Effective Time,
all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share
held by the Company as treasury stock or held directly by Parent or Merger Sub
(or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub), in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or
payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof.

 

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. All outstanding shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub held immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become (in the aggregate) one hundred shares of newly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of_ _Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity
and terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger in accordance with this Article
2 (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees
and expenses of the Paying Agent. At the Closing and substantially
concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which
holders of Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the
payments contemplated pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, Parent shall
promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent such
additional funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make
such payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed
by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares in accordance with this Article 2; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such investments shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United
States government or rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investor Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Earnings from such
investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Surviving
Corporation, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Shares.

 



4

    

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares
represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
of the Certificate as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_) to the Paying
Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together
with delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper form,
with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly
represented by such Certificates (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_), and any Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
any surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have
been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Shares
in accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a Certificate
or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository
Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of
record of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depository Trust
Company whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall automatically upon the Effective Time be entitled to
receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The
Depository Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, in respect of each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in
immediately available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_),
and such Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The
Depository Trust Company: (A) a

 



5

    

 letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter
of transmittal in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of
such letter of transmittal, in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_), and such Book-
Entry Shares so surrendered shall at the Effective Time be cancelled. Payment
of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares so surrendered
shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are
registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon
due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash
as contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Shares representing
Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed to represent the right to receive
payment of the fair value of such Shares in accordance with and to the extent
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an affiliate thereof
designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_ prior to such time
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law as provided in Section 2.5, in respect of such
holders surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance
with the procedures in  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
or an affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates will be liable to
any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available
to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(a)_, to pay for Shares
for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_.
Parent or the Paying Agent may, in their reasonable discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a
reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_), Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the
DGCL (such shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law as
provided in Section 2.5. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or compromise, any such demands, or agree to do
any of the foregoing.

2.4 _Treatment of Options and Restricted_ _S_ _tock Units_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Options_. At the Effective Time, each option to purchase
Shares (each a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically and
without any required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company,
be cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an
amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares
underlying the Company Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price of such Company Option;
provided that any such Company Option with respect to which the exercise
price subject thereto is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration
shall be canceled for no consideration.

 

(b) _Treatment of Time-Based Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding award of Company restricted stock units (" _Company RSUs_ ")
that at such time is subject solely to service-based vesting conditions and
has no performance conditions to earn the units or the Shares covered thereby
shall, automatically and without any required action on the part of the
holder thereof or the Company, be cancelled and be converted into the right to

 



7

    

 receive (without interest) an amount in cash equal to (x) the total number
of Shares underlying such award of Company RSUs, _ multiplied by_ (y) the
Merger Consideration, which such amounts shall be paid in accordance with,
and subject to satisfaction of, the same vesting and settlement schedule and
other terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) _Treatment of Performance Restricted Stock Units_ (d) . At the Effective
Time, each outstanding award of Company RSUs that at such time is subject to
performance-based vesting conditions or a requirement to satisfy performance
conditions to earn the units or the Shares covered thereby (" _Performance
RSUs_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
become earned (meaning eligible to vest upon satisfaction of service-based
vesting conditions) (i) with respect to Performance RSUs that are subject to
market-based vesting conditions, as to the number of Shares subject to such
award that would be earned based on the Companys actual level of achievement
as of the Effective Time, at the price per Share of the Merger Consideration
and (ii) with respect to the Performance RSUs that are subject to revenue-
based vesting conditions, as to the number of Shares subject to such award
that would vest based on target level achievement, and, in each case, shall,
after giving effect to such achievement, automatically and without any
required action on the part of the holder thereof or the Company, be
cancelled and be converted into the right to receive (without interest) an
amount in cash equal to (x) the number of earned Shares underlying such award,
_multiplied by_ (y) the Merger Consideration, which such amounts shall be
paid in accordance with, and subject to satisfaction of, the same service-
based vesting conditions (for example, continued employment through the end of
the applicable performance period), if any, and settlement schedule and other
terms and conditions applicable to the corresponding Performance RSU as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, including any double-trigger
vesting accelerations.

 

(d) _Payment by Surviving Corporation_. The Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to the holders of
Company Options and Company RSUs (i) the amounts described in _Sections 2.4(a_
), _2.4(b)_ , and _2.4(c)_ that vest after the Effective Time (which may, for
example, occur at the end of a specified performance period for Performance
RSUs), no later than the second regularly scheduled payroll date of the
Surviving Corporation following the applicable vesting date; and (ii) the
amounts described in _Sections 2.4(a)_ , _2.4(b)_ , and _2.4(c)_
 attributable to unexercised, outstanding, vested Company Options as of the
Effective Time and unsettled, outstanding, vested Company RSUs as of the
Effective Time, if any, no later than the second regularly scheduled payroll
date of the Surviving Corporation following the Closing Date. The foregoing
payments shall be less Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such
payments.

 

(e) _Termination of Company Equity Plans_ (f) . As of the Effective Time, the
Companys Amended and Restated 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the " _Company
Equity Plan_ ") shall be terminated and no further Shares, Company Options,
Company RSUs, other Equity Interests in the Company or other rights with
respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder. Following the Effective Time,
no such Company Option, Company RSU, Performance RSU, Equity Interest or other
right that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain outstanding and each former holder of any such Company Option,
Company RSU, Performance RSU, Equity Interest or other right shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
applicable consideration set forth in this Section 2.4.

 



8

    

(g) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall
adopt appropriate resolutions and take such other actions as are reasonably
necessary and appropriate (including using commercially reasonably efforts to
obtain any required consents) to effect the transactions described in this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.4_.

(a) _Termination of Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. As promptly as practicable
after the date hereof, the Company shall take all action as may be required
to provide that (i) the ESPP shall terminate immediately upon the Purchase
Date (as defined in the ESPP) of the current Offering Period (as defined in
the ESPP), (ii) no new Offering Periods shall commence on or after the date
hereof (for the avoidance of doubt, the current Offering Period and scheduled
Purchase Date shall occur in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
ESPP), and (iii) to the extent permitted pursuant to the terms of the ESPP,
no individual currently participating in the ESPP may (x) increase the
percentage of his or her Compensation (as defined in the ESPP) that such
participant has subscribed for deduction with respect to the ESPP as of the
date hereof, or (y) provide any contributions for ESPP purchases other than
pursuant to previously selected Compensation deductions. Following the
Purchase Date of the current Offering Period, there shall no longer remain
any outstanding rights to purchase Shares under the ESPP.

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other provision
of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld and
paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

2.6 _Adjustments_. In the event that, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur as a
result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of Equity Interests convertible into or exchangeable
for Shares), recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other similar event, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted to reflect such event and to provide to holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
provided that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall be deemed to permit
or authorize the Company to take any such action or effect any such change
that it is not otherwise authorized or permitted to take pursuant to this
Agreement (including _Section_ __ _ 5.1_).

Company necessary to adopt this Agreement is the adoption of this Agreement
by the holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the Shares
that are outstanding and entitled to vote thereon at the Company Meeting (the

or any other Equity Interests of the Company is necessary to consummate the

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not and
will not, and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions and
compliance by the Company with any of the terms or provisions hereof will not,

notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) under the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, (ii) any applicable requirements of

ARTICLE 4

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

 

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by Parent and Merger
Sub to the Company (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") prior to the
execution of this Agreement (with specific reference to the representations
and warranties in this _Article 4_ to which the information in such schedule
relates; _provided_ , that, disclosure in the Parent Disclosure Schedule as
to a specific representation or warranty shall qualify any other sections of
this Agreement to the extent (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross
reference) it is reasonably apparent that such disclosure relates to such
other sections), Parent and Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the
Company as follows:

4.1 _Corporate Organization_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation
or other entity duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent
applicable, in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
organization and has the requisite corporate or other entity power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
licensed or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the
properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.2 _Authority, Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform and comply with each of its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Transactions applicable to such party. The
execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, the
performance and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with each of its
obligations herein and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Transactions applicable to it have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and no stockholder votes are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions to which it is a party. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub has duly and validly executed and delivered this Agreement and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes Parents and Merger Subs legal, valid
and binding obligation, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, except as limited by Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general equitable principles or
by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding
seeking enforcement may be brought.

 

4.3 _No Conflict_ _s_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub,
does not and will not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub will not, (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the
certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents of
Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and permits described in _Section_ __ _ 4.3(b)_ have been
obtained and all filings and notifications described in _Section_ __ _
4.3(b)_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have 

 



28

    

 terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to
Parent, Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent (each a " _Parent
Subsidiary_ " and, collectively, the " _Parent Subsidiaries_ "), or by which
any property or asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is bound or affected
or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result in any breach of or any
loss of any benefit under, constitute a change of control or default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under
or give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration
or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or
asset of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, including Merger Sub, pursuant to,
any Contract or Permit to which Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is a party,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
in _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Merger Sub does not and will not, and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Sub of the Transactions and compliance by Parent and Merger Sub
with any of the terms or provisions hereof will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, any
Governmental Entity, except (i) under the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of Nasdaq, (ii) as required or advisable under any
applicable Competition Laws, (iii) the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL and (iv) where failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings
or notifications would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

4.4 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and neither
Parent nor Merger Sub is subject to any outstanding Order that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect or that challenges the validity or propriety of the
Merger.

 

4.5 _Financing_.

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the
executed Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letters as in effect on
the date hereof (with, in the case of the Debt Commitment Letter and any
related Debt Fee Letter, only the fee amounts, interest rates, original issue
discount, and economic and other "market flex" terms redacted, none of which
redacted provisions would be reasonably expected to adversely affect the
amount or availability of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date). Neither
Parent nor any of its affiliates has entered into any agreement, side letter
or other arrangement relating to funding of the Debt Financing and Equity
Financing, other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters and, in the case
of the Debt Financing, for the Debt Fee Letter (including any "market flex"
provisions set forth therein) and customary engagement letters and fee credit
letters in respect of securities offerings contemplated in lieu of the Debt
Financing.

(b) As of the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letters and in this Agreement and assuming the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ and the conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letters, the proceeds of the Financing (both before
and after giving effect to the exercise of any or all "market

 



29

    

 flex" provisions related thereto) will be sufficient to consummate the
Transactions, including the payment of the Merger Consideration on the Closing
Date. As of the date hereof, the respective commitments contained in the
Commitment Letters have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. As of
the date hereof, the Commitment Letters are in full force and effect against
Parent and represent a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent
and, to Parents knowledge, each other party thereto, to provide the financing
contemplated thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letters as of the date hereof
and except as limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights
generally, by general equitable principles or by the discretion of any
Governmental Entity before which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be
brought (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law
or in equity). Parent has fully paid (or caused to be fully paid) any and all
commitment fees and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the
date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing. To Parents
knowledge as of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default on the
part of Parent or any other party thereto under any of the Commitment
Letters. Parent has no reason to believe that it or any other party thereto
will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term of the Commitment
Letters. The only conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date that will be included in
the Debt Financing Documents shall be the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof; provided that if any portion of the
Debt Financing or Bond Financing is funded into an escrow prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the inclusion in
the escrow arrangement of conditions customary for escrow arrangements of this
nature (and the escrow arrangement itself) will not constitute a breach of
this Agreement. Parent has no reason to believe that (i) any of such
conditions will not be satisfied or (ii) the Financing will not be made
available to Parent on the Closing Date.

 

(c) Parent understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this
Agreement, Parents obligation to consummate the Merger is not in any way
contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parents consummation of any financing
arrangements, Parents obtaining of any financing or the availability, grant,
provision or extension of any financing to Parent.

 

4.6 _Guarantees_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Guarantors have delivered to the Company the Guarantees dated as of the date
hereof. Each of the Guarantees is in full force and effect and is a valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantors party thereto, enforceable against the
Guarantors party thereto in accordance with its terms, except as limited by
Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general
equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before
which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default on the part of Guarantors under the Guarantees.

 

4.7 _Proxy Statement_. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date that the Proxy Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto is mailed to holders of Shares and at the time of the
Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (except that no
representation or warranty is made by Parent or Merger Sub to such portions
thereof that relate expressly to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to
statements made therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of
Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein).

 



30

    

4.8 _Ownership of Company Capital Stock_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
Parent Subsidiary beneficially owns any Shares or other Equity Interests in
the Company as of the date hereof. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is, nor at
any time during the last three years has it been, an "interested stockholder"
of the Company as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL (other than as
contemplated by this Agreement).

4.9 _Solvency_. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Article 3_ at and immediately prior to the Closing, after giving
effect to the consummation of the Merger and the consummation of the
Financing, the Surviving Corporation will not (i) be insolvent (either
because its financial condition is such that the sum of its liabilities is
greater than the fair market value of its assets or because the fair saleable
value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its liabilities
as they come due), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with which to engage
in its business or fail to satisfy any capital adequacy requirements under Law
or (iii) have incurred obligations beyond its ability to pay them as they
become due.

 

4.10 _Ownership of Parent and Merger Sub_. All of the outstanding Equity
Interests of Parent and Merger Sub have been duly authorized and validly
issued. All of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Merger Sub are,
and at the Effective Time will be, owned directly or indirectly by Parent.
Merger Sub was formed solely for purposes of the Merger and, except for
matters incident to formation and execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the performance of the Transactions, has not prior to the date hereof
engaged in any business or other activities.

 

4.11 _No Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. Except for this Agreement,
or as expressly authorized by the Company Board, neither Parent or Merger
Sub, nor any of their respective affiliates, is a party to any Contracts, or
has made or entered into any formal or informal arrangements or other
understandings (including as to continuing employment), with any
stockholder, director or officer of the Company relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other Transactions, or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, businesses or operations from and after the Effective Time.

 

4.12 _Brokers_. Except for the financial advisors fees set forth in _Section_
__ _ 4.12_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary nor any of their respective officers or directors on behalf of
Parent or such Parent Subsidiary has employed any financial advisor, broker or
finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory, brokers fees,
commissions or finders fees in connection with any of the Transactions.

4.13 _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
has conducted its own independent review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, Intellectual Property, technology, liabilities, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company and each of them
acknowledges that it and its Representatives have received access to such
books and records, facilities, equipment, contracts and other assets of the
Company that it and its Representatives have requested to review, and that it
and its

 



31

    

 Representatives have had full opportunity to meet with the management of the
Company and to discuss the business and assets of the Company. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on behalf
of the Company makes, and none of Parent or Merger Sub has relied upon, any
express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided to
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the Transactions including the
accuracy or completeness thereof other than the representations and warranties
contained in _Article 3_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and
agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and their respective affiliates, stockholders,
controlling persons or Representatives shall not have any liability or
responsibility whatsoever to Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary, or
their respective affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or
Representatives on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) based upon any information (including any
statement, document or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any
financial statements and any projections, estimates or other forward-looking
information) provided or made available (including in any data rooms,
management presentations, information or descriptive memorandum or
supplemental information), or statements made (or any omissions therefrom), to
Parent, Merger Sub, any Parent Subsidiary, or any of their respective
affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Representatives, except as
and only to the extent expressly set forth in _Article 3_.

such information concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets and
liabilities of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries as Parent or its
Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company
believes that doing so would: (A) result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege (but the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss
of attorney-client privilege), (B) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third

 



35

    

 parties or otherwise breach, contravene or violate any effective Contract
existing on the date hereof to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, (C) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law or (D) result
in the disclosure of materials provided to the Company Board or resolutions or
minutes of the Company Board, in each case, that were provided to the Company
Board in connection with its consideration of the Merger or the sale process.

(b) The Confidentiality Agreement, dated November 9, 2018, by and between the
Company and Francisco Partners Management, L.P. (the " _FP Confidentiality
Agreement_ " and the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of December 1, 2019 by
and between the Company and Elliott Management Corporation (the " _EM
Confidentiality Agreement_ " and collectively, with the FP Confidentiality
Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ "), shall apply with respect to
information furnished under this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ by the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their Representatives. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties acknowledge that (i) Parent is a "Representative" of Elliott
Management Corporation under the EM Confidentiality Agreement and (ii)
a "Representative" of Francisco Partners Management, L.P. under the FP
Confidentiality Agreement.

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and continuing
until 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the day that is 45 calendar days
following the date of this Agreement (the " _Solicitation Period End Date_ "),
the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their respective directors,
officers, employees and other Representatives shall have the right to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate and encourage any
Acquisition Proposals or the making thereof, including by way of furnishing
nonpublic information to any Third Party pursuant to (but only pursuant to)
one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; provided, however, that any
material information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to be provided

available to Parent or Merger Sub concurrently with or prior to such time as
it is provided or made available to such Third Party; and (ii) enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise cooperate with or assist or
participate in or facilitate any such discussions or negotiations or

5.3_ (including with respect to any Exempted Person), from and after the
Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, (x) promptly cease and
terminate (or cause to be terminated) any discussions or negotiations with any
Third Party and its affiliates and Representatives that may be ongoing with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (y) request any such Third Party
to promptly return or destroy all confidential information furnished by or on
behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with the Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements and (z) terminate access by any Third Party and its
affiliates and Representatives to any data room (virtual, online or
otherwise) maintained by or on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries.
Except as expressly permitted by (and subject to) this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_,
from and after the Solicitation Period End Date until the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in

 



36

    

 accordance with _Article 7_ , the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers, legal counsel,
and investment bankers not to, and shall not authorize or knowingly permit
its other Representatives to, (A) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (B) engage in,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with
respect thereto or that could reasonably be expected to lead to the submission
of any Acquisition Proposal (other than to state that the terms of this
provision prohibit such discussions), (C) provide any non-public information
to any Person in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or
offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or
(D) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal. Except as expressly permitted by this _Section_ __ _
5.3_, from and after the Solicitation Period End Date until the receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval, or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ , neither the Company Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or any offer or proposal that
would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
withdraw, change or qualify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Board Recommendation, (iii) approve or cause the Company to enter
into any merger agreement, letter of intent or other similar agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (v) make any recommendation or public
statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the equity
securities of the Company other than a recommendation against such offer
(other than the issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look
and listen" statement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(g)_) or (vi) resolve or
agree to do any of the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing
clauses (i) - (v) of this sentence, a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").
No later than twenty four (24) hours following the Solicitation Period End
Date, the Company shall notify Parent in writing of the identity of each
Exempted Person, together with a copy of the Acquisition Proposal submitted
by such Exempted Person and the material terms and conditions of any proposal
or offer regarding an Acquisition Proposal (including any amendments or
modifications thereof) received from such Exempted Person on or prior to the
Solicitation Period End Date (which shall include a copy of such proposal or
offer), and copies of each Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
on or prior to the Solicitation Period End Date. Notwithstanding the
commencement of the obligations of the Company under this _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, from and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company may
continue to engage in the activities described in this  _Section_ __ _
5.3(b) _with respect to any Acquisition Proposal submitted by an Exempted
Person on or before the Solicitation Period End Date until 11:59 p.m. (New
York City time) on the date on which such Acquisition Proposal expires by its
terms, or the Exempted Person has otherwise terminated or withdrawn such
Acquisition Proposal (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any amended
or revised Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Exempted Person shall not
be deemed to constitute, in and of itself, an expiration, termination or
withdrawal of such previously submitted Acquisition Proposal) or ceased to be
an Exempted Person.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, if at any time following the Solicitation Period End Date and prior
to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval (i) the Company has
received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party, (ii) the
Company has not breached this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ in any material respect
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside counsel, based on information then

 



37

    

 available, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Third
Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its representatives and potential
sources of financing pursuant to (but only pursuant to) one or more Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreements and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that any information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries to be provided or made available to any Third
Party shall, to the extent not previously provided or made available to Parent
or Merger Sub, be provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub
concurrently with or prior to such time as it is provided or made available to
such Third Party.

(d) From and after the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company shall
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) notify Parent in the
event that the Company receives any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
notify Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours) of the
identity of such Person and provide to Parent a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonable
description of such Acquisition Proposal). Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours after such
determination) advise Parent if the Company determines to begin providing
information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning an
Acquisition Proposal and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on
a current basis (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of Parents
reasonable request), of the status and material terms of any such proposals
(including any amendment thereto) and any material changes to the status of
any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, the
Company Board may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, (i) effect a Change of Board Recommendation with respect to such
Superior Proposal and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.1(f)_, in either case if the Company Board determines in good faith
that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company and subject to the requirements of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_. The Company shall not be entitled to effect a
Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e)_ or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ unless the
Company shall have provided to Parent at least four Business Days prior
written notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") of the Companys intention to take
such action, which notice shall include a copy of such Superior Proposal and
all related documentation (including the definitive transaction agreement
(and related schedules and exhibits) to be entered into in respect of such
Superior Proposal and, if applicable, financing documentation), and:

 

(i) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused its legal and financial advisors to have, engaged in
good faith negotiations with Parent regarding any amendment to this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent and intended to cause the relevant Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 



38

    

(ii) the Company Board shall have considered in good faith any adjustments
and/or proposed amendments to this Agreement (including a change to the price
terms hereof) and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may be
irrevocably offered in writing by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no
later than 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Notice
Period and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside counsel, that the Superior Proposal would
continue to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such
action would continue to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company if such Proposed Changed Terms were to be given
effect.

 

In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal offered in
writing by the party making such Superior Proposal (including any change in
purchase price), the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice
to Parent and to again comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _
5.3(e)_ with respect to such new written notice, except that the Notice
Period shall be two Business Days with respect to any such new written notice.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)_, the Company Board may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval effect a Change of Board Recommendation if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation its financial
advisors and outside counsel, that an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing and (ii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to effect a Change of
Board Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company, but
such Change of Board Recommendation shall not occur until a time that is after
the fourth Business Day following Parents receipt of written notice from the
Company advising Parent of the material information and facts relating to such
Intervening Event and stating that it intends to make a Change of Board
Recommendation and provided that (A) during such four Business Day period the
Company has negotiated in good faith with Parent to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable the Company Board to proceed with the Company Board
Recommendation and (B) at the end of such four Business Day period, the
Company Board maintains its determination described in this clause (ii) (after
taking into account any adjustments offered in writing by Parent to the
material terms and conditions of this Agreement).

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company
Board from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act; or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of the Company if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties or violate applicable Law; provided, however, the Company may only make
any such disclosure that constitutes a Change of Board Recommendation in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(e) or (f)_, as the case may be. The
issuance by the Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change
of Board Recommendation.

 



39

    

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any offer, inquiry, indication of
interest or proposal from a Third Party concerning (A) a merger,
consolidation or other business combination transaction or series of related
transactions involving the Company, (B) any direct or indirect sale, lease or
other disposition by merger, consolidation, business combination, share
exchange, joint venture, recapitalization, spin-off or otherwise, of assets of
the Company (including Equity Interests of any Subsidiary of the Company) or
its Subsidiaries representing 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, based on their fair market value as determined
in good faith by the Company Board, (C) any acquisition by any Person or group
(as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), resulting in, or any
proposal, offer, inquiry or indication of interest that if consummated would
result in, any Person or group (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange
Act) becoming the beneficial owner of, directly or indirectly, in one or a
series of related transactions, any class of equity securities of the Company
representing 25% or more of the voting power or Shares of the Company, or (D)
any combination of the foregoing (in each case, other than the Merger).

 

(ii) " _Exempted Person_ " means any Person or group of Persons (so long as,
in the case of a group of Persons, the members of such group who were members
of such group immediately prior to the Solicitation Period End Date constitute
more than 75% of the equity financing and voting control of such group of
Persons at all times following the Solicitation Period End Date), from whom
the Company or any of its Representatives has received a bona fide Acquisition
Proposal after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Solicitation
Period End Date that, on or before the Solicitation Period End Date, the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, and such Acquisition Proposal has not been
amended in a manner adverse to the Company or withdrawn and has not expired
or been terminated as of the Solicitation Period End Date. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ to the contrary, any Exempted
Person shall cease to be an Exempted Person for all purposes under this
Agreement upon such time as the Acquisition Proposal made by such Person is
amended in a manner adverse to the Company, withdrawn, expires or is
terminated or members of such group of Persons cease to constitute more than
75% of equity financing and voting control of such group.

(iii) " _Intervening Event_ " means any event, change, effect, development,
state of facts, condition or occurrence after that date of this Agreement that
is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries that (A) was not known to, or
reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board as of or prior to the date of
this Agreement, and (B) does not involve or relate to (I) an Acquisition
Proposal, (II) changes in the trading price or trading volume of Shares
(provided that the underlying cause of such changes may be taken into account
in determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred) or (III) any
overachievement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any
revenue, earnings or other financial projections or forecasts (provided that
the underlying cause of such overachievement may be taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred)..

(iv) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
(except the references therein to "25%" shall be replaced by "50%") that did
not result from a breach by the Company of  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ and that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside counsel, taking into account such factors as the Company
Board considers in good faith to be appropriate (including the
conditionality, timing and likelihood of consummation of such proposals), is
more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders
than the Merger (taking into account any proposed changes with respect to
such Superior Proposal and the Proposed Changed Terms).

 



40

    

5.4 _SEC Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date
of this Agreement) the Company shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with
the SEC, which shall, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, include the Company
Board Recommendation. Parent and Merger Sub, and their counsel, shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy Statement before it is
filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to any
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent and
Merger Sub or their counsel. The Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to comments by the
SEC staff in respect of the Proxy Statement and to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as of the record date
established for the Company Meeting as promptly as practicable after the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to mail the definitive Proxy Statement to the Companys
stockholders prior to the date that is five calendar days after the
Solicitation Period End Date. The Company shall provide Parent and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall provide them a summary of any
oral comments, that the Company or its counsel receive from the SEC or its
staff with respect to the Proxy Statement as promptly as practicable after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. Parent
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on drafts of the Proxy Statement, SEC comments with respect thereto and any
other documents related to the Company Meeting, and the Company shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish all
information that is customarily included in a proxy statement prepared in
connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement
concerning themselves and their affiliates as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall: (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL, the Company Charter,
and the Company Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders promptly following, and in any event no more than
forty-five (45) calendar days after, the mailing of the Proxy Statement for
the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company
Meeting_ "),; and (ii) subject to a Change of Board Recommendation in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, shall include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, and shall not postpone or adjourn the Company
Meeting other than (i) to allow additional solicitation of proxies in order to
obtain the Company Stockholder Approval if necessary, (ii) if the Company is
required to postpone or adjourn the Company Meeting by applicable Law, (iii)
if there has been a Change of Board Recommendation and the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
Companys stockholders should be provided with additional time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that the Company has made available to such
stockholders, (iv) with the consent of Parent, or (v) if a quorum has not
been established. In the event of a Change of Board Recommendation, the

 



41

    

 Company nevertheless shall continue to submit this Agreement to the
stockholders of the Company for approval at the Company Meeting unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms prior to
the Company Meeting. Once the Company has established a record date for the
Company Meeting, the Company will not change such record date or establish a
different record date for the Company Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(c) The Company agrees to (i) provide Parent, on a timely basis, with the
daily written voting reports it receives concerning proxy solicitation results
for each of the ten (10) Business Days prior to the then scheduled Company
Meeting and (ii) to use its reasonable efforts to give written notice to
Parent one Business Day prior to the Company Meeting and on the day of, but
prior to, the Company Meeting of the status of the Company Stockholder
Approval.

 

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other Transactions as promptly as practicable, including using
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) obtain all consents,
approvals or waivers from, or participation in other discussions or
negotiations with, third parties, including under any Contract to which the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries is party or by
which such Person or any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound, (ii) obtain all necessary or advisable actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities
(including, without limitation, those in connection with applicable
Competition Laws and the Communications Regulatory Consents), make all
necessary or advisable registrations, declarations and filings with and take
all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to
avoid any Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity (including, without
limitation, in connection with applicable Competition Laws and the
Communications Regulatory Consents), (iii) resist, contest or defend any
Proceeding (including administrative or judicial Proceedings) challenging the
Merger or the completion of the Transactions, including seeking to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and that could restrict, prevent or prohibit consummation of the Transactions,
(iv) execute and deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Transactions and fully to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and
(v) cause their affiliates to execute and deliver any notices, filings or
applications required to be filed with any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the Transactions. Each of the parties shall and shall
cause their respective affiliates to, furnish to each other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information, the Company and Parent shall have
the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall
consult with the other in connection with, all of the information relating to
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective
Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection
with the Merger and the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights,
each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, the 

 



42

    

 Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status
of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other written substantive
communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or third
party with respect to such transactions, and, to the extent practicable under
the circumstances, shall provide the other party and its counsel with the
opportunity to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in
connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to
Parents obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(a)_, Parent shall control
the coordination of any applications, notifications or filings, obtaining
any necessary approvals, and resolving any investigation or other inquiry of
any such agency or other Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Laws. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each
of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates
to, make or cause to be made (i) all required HSR Act notifications within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, and (ii) all filings
required under applicable any other Competition Laws with respect to the
Transactions as promptly as practicable.

(b) Parent agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, any
and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any and all undertakings
necessary to resolve, avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
applicable Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as
practicable (and in any event, no later than the Extended Outside Date),
including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to, and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture,
licensing or disposition of any assets, properties or businesses of Parent or
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or (ii) accepting any
operational restrictions or otherwise taking or committing to take actions
that limit Parents or any Parent Subsidiarys freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain, any of the assets, properties, licenses, rights,
product lines, operations or businesses of Parent or the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in each case, as may be required in order to
avoid the entry of, or to effect the lifting or dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order, or other Order in any suit or
Proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Closing, as applicable. If such efforts fail to resolve, avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any applicable Competition Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger so as to
enable the Closing to occur, then Parent shall use its best efforts through
the Extended Outside Date to defend through litigation on the merits any claim
asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated
or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that
would prevent the Closing from occurring. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, none of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to agree to any sale,
transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or
to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership,
operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other
modification of rights in respect of, any assets, properties or businesses of
Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, in each
case, is not conditioned on the consummation of the Transactions. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if Parent requests Company
to divest or otherwise dispose of an asset or assets (including any business
line or segment), Parent shall, and shall cause its affiliates, to furnish to
Parent such information regarding such assets reasonably requested by Parent
and to reasonably participate and co-operate in any requested sale, license
or other disposition, subject to the condition specified in the previous
sentence.

 



43

    

(c) None of the parties shall: (i) take any action the effect of which, or
refrain from taking any action the effect of refraining from which, would
reasonably be expected to delay or impede the ability of the parties to
consummate the Transactions, or (ii) directly or indirectly acquire or agree
to acquire (by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner), any Person or
portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the
entering into a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of,
such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (A)
impose any material delay in the obtaining of, or materially increase the risk
of not obtaining, any permits, orders or other approvals of any Governmental
Entity necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or
termination of any applicable waiting period, (B) materially increase the risk
of any Governmental Entity seeking an Order prohibiting the consummation of
the Transactions, (C) increase the risk of not being able to remove any such
Order on appeal or otherwise, or (D) delay or prevent the consummation of the
Transactions.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the
Company prior to the consummation of the Merger. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete unilateral control and supervision over its business
operations. 

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_ , unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or Nasdaq (or any other securities
market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party becoming aware
of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay beyond the Outside
Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would reasonably be expected
to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 6_ not
being satisfied. Any such notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ shall
not affect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement and any failure (other than any such failure which is a
Willful and Material Breach) to make such notice (in and of itself) shall not
be taken into account in determining whether the conditions set forth in
_Article 6_ have been satisfied or give rise to any right of termination set

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Closing Date and ending on the date
that is twelve months following the Closing Date, Parent shall provide or
cause the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to provide
to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Effective Time (each a " _Continuing Employee_ "), during any period of
employment with the Surviving Corporation following the Closing, (i) base
salary or wages and a target annual cash bonus opportunity that is not less
than the base compensation and target annual cash bonus opportunity provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
other compensation and benefits (excluding equity award compensation) that are
substantially equivalent in aggregate economic value to other compensation and
benefits provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) Without limiting the generality of  _Section_ __ _ 5.8(a)_, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to, assume, honor and
continue during the period ending on the date that is twelve months following
the Closing Date or, if sooner, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all of the Companys employment, severance, retention and
termination plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements, in
each case, as in effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event), without any amendment or
modification, other than any amendment or modification required to comply
with applicable Law or as consented to by the parties thereto.

(c) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation (including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting and
benefit accruals, each Continuing Employees service with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, as reflected in the Companys records, shall be treated
as service with Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits and the foregoing service credit shall not apply with respect to
any defined benefit plan.

 



45

    

(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) to, waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries in which Continuing Employees (and
their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause
the Parent Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to recognize, or
cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and
similar expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-
payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such
Continuing Employee (and dependents) will be eligible to participate from and
after the Effective Time.

 

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 8.10_, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to
this Agreement, and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.8_
__ shall create such rights in any such individuals. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time
and for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective affiliates to continue any Company Benefit Plan or other

5.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and shall advance expenses as incurred, to the fullest extent
permitted under (i) applicable Law, (ii) the Company Charter, the Company
Bylaws or similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (iii) any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect
as of the date of this Agreement, each present and former director and officer
of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan (in each case, when acting in
such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whenever asserted,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions.

 



46

    

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective employees who
serves as a fiduciary of a Company Benefit Plan as provided in its
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms. For a period of no less than six years from the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the applicable
partys certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar organization
documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any Contract of
the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors,
officers or employees in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made
within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such
Proceeding.

 

(c) For six years from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be jointly and severally responsible for maintaining for
the benefit of the directors and officers of the Company, as of the date of
this Agreement and as of the Closing Date, an insurance and indemnification
policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to
and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the existing policy
of the Company, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual
premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 350% of the last annual premium
paid by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement, it being understood
that if the total premiums payable for such insurance coverage exceeds such
amount, Parent shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for
a cost equal to such amount. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been
obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide
such directors and officers with such coverage for an aggregate period of six
years with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, including in respect of this Agreement or the
Transactions.

 

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case,
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper
provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 



47

    

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
similar organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or
in any Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. The obligations of Parent under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ applies
unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or
(y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_).

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
or advancement of expenses provided for in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies.

5.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or
advisable to arrange the Debt Financing, including using reasonable best
efforts to:

(i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, not consent to any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, and not replacing, the Debt Commitment Letter, if
such amendment, modification, waiver or replacement: (A) reduces
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount
of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing) to an
amount less than the amount necessary to consummate the Merger (unless the
Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount) or (B) imposes new
or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (2)
make the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of Parent to enforce its rights against other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto when
required pursuant to this Agreement (provided, that (x) Parent may amend the
Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof; (y) Parent may amend the Debt
Commitment Letter in connection with an escrow arrangement to include
conditions customary for escrow arrangements of this nature and (z) at the
Companys request, Parent shall keep the Company reasonably apprised of the
status and terms and conditions of any amendments, modifications, waivers or
replacements, and shall promptly furnish to the Company copies of any
agreements or other documentation with respect to such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement);

 

(ii) cause the Equity Financing to be consummated upon satisfaction of the
conditions contained in the Equity Commitment Letter that are within its
control;

(v) in the event that the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1 and _6.3_ have
been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, cause the Financing
Sources to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing at or prior to the

Financing Failure Event.

(b) (i) Parent shall consult with and keep the Company informed in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and (ii) promptly

the reasonable request of the Company. Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice of any breach or repudiation, or any threatened breach or repudiation,
by any party to the Commitment Letters of which Parent or its affiliates
becomes aware. Without limiting Parents other obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs, Parent shall (i)
promptly notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons
therefor, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain (on terms not less
favorable in the aggregate to Parent as those set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter) alternative financing from alternative debt financing sources, in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with the Equity Financing, and the
available portion of the Debt Financing, to pay the Merger Consideration and
consummate the Transactions, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain,
and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of, a replacement debt
financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing (with only
the fee amounts, interest rates, original issue discount, and economic and
other "market flex" terms redacted (none of which redacted provisions would be
reasonably expected to adversely affect the amount or availability of
the Debt Financing on the Closing Date). Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice (and in any event within 24 hours) of Parents receipt of a Notes Flex
Notice.

 

(c) Upon any such amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the
Commitment Letters in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ all
references herein to "Commitment Letter" or "Debt Commitment Letter", as
applicable, shall include and mean such documents as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or modified in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ and
references to "Financing", or "Debt Financing", as applicable, shall include
and mean the financing contemplated by such Commitment Letter as so amended,
replaced, supplemented or modified in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.10_.

Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any portion
of the Debt Financing or Bond Financing is funded into an escrow prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the inclusion in
the escrow arrangement of conditions customary for escrow arrangements of
this nature (and the escrow arrangement itself) will not constitute a breach
of this Agreement.

(f) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its
reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required Information in
order to ensure that the Required Information does not, when furnished and
taken as a whole, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

7.3 _Company Termination Fee._

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(e)_ or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _

Company, or within two Business Days thereafter, in the case of a termination
by Parent, the Company Termination Fee. The " _Company Termination Fee_ "

to any Acquisition Proposal within twelve months after such termination and
the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, then
the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee to Parent concurrently with
the consummation of such transaction. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _
7.3(b)_, the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have the meaning assigned

Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_, Parents
receipt of the Company Termination Fee (if received) from or on behalf of the
Company shall be Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy (whether
based in contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute,
regulation or applicable Laws or otherwise) against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, 

 



58

    

 current or future direct or indirect equity holders, general or limited
partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members, managers, directors,
officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "
_Company Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as a result
of the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be consummated, for
any breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of
such amount, no such Person shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

7.4 _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

(a) The parties agree that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(h)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(i)_, then Parent

transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing
by the Company, or in the absence of such designation, an account established
for the sole benefit of the Company.

 

(c) Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.4_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that
without these agreements, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company would not enter
into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

(d) In circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee is payable in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 7.4(a)_, the Companys receipt of the Parent Termination
Fee (if received) from or on behalf of Parent or Guarantor shall be the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy (whether based in contract, tort or strict
liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by any legal or equitable
proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Laws or
otherwise) against Parent and its affiliates and any of their respective
former, current or future direct or indirect equity holders, general or
limited partners, controlling persons, stockholders, members, managers,
directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively,
the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses and damages suffered as
a result of the failure of the Merger or the other Transactions to be
consummated, for any breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise, and
upon payment of such amount, no such Person shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions.

7.5 _Payments; Limitation on Recourse_. (a) Other than with respect to
the right to seek specific performance of the Equity Commitment Letters to
the extent permitted by and in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letters
(any such claims under the Equity Commitment Letters, the " _ECL Claims_ "),
and recourse against the Guarantors under the Guarantees to the extent
provided therein, any claim or cause of action under this Agreement may only
be brought against Persons that are expressly named as parties, and then only
with respect to the specific obligations set forth in this Agreement. Other
than the ECL Claims and such recourse against the Guarantors under the
Guarantees, no Company Related Party or Parent Related Party shall have any
liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements, obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub or of or for any claim, investigation, or

 



59

    

 Proceeding, in each case under, based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
this Agreement or the Transactions (including the breach, termination or
failure to consummate such Transactions), in each case whether based on
contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any assessment, by
any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or
applicable Laws or otherwise and whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate, limited liability company or partnership veil, by or through a
claim by or on behalf of a party or another Person (including a claim to
enforce the Debt Commitment Letter) or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither any party hereto nor any of
their respective subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall have any direct
rights or claims against any Financing Source (other than Parent and Merger
Sub), in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise.

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, under no
circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent, Merger
Sub and the other Parent Related Parties for breaches under this Agreement,
the Guarantees and the ECL Claims exceed an amount equal to the Parent
Termination Fee plus the Reimbursement Obligations for all such breaches
(the " _Parent Liability Limitation_ "). In no event will any of the Company
or any of its affiliates seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain,
nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
award in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation against (i) Parent, Merger
Sub or the Guarantor; or (ii) the other Parent Related Parties, and in no
event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be entitled to seek or
obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability Limitation
against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this Agreement,
the Debt Commitment Letter, the Guarantees (subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein) and the Equity Commitment Letters (subject to
the terms and conditions set forth therein and in  _Section_ __ _ 8.14(b)_
of this Agreement).

Sub by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors
at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made which,
by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by the Companys stockholders without
such approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Sections 7.5_
, _8.10_ and _8.12(d)_ and this  _Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_ (and any provision
of this Agreement to the extent a modification, waiver or termination of such
provision would modify the substance of _Sections 7.5_ , _8.10_ and _8.12(d)_

in a manner that is adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written

the Companys stockholders hereunder without the approval of such
stockholders. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other

been satisfied or waived by the Parent, (ii) the dates of July 3, 2020 and
November 26 and 27, 2020 shall not be included in the calculation of the Bank

the Company to that effect (stating, if applicable, with specificity which

to restate any financial statements or financial information included in the
Bank Required Information or that any such restatement is under
consideration, in which case the Bank Marketing Period will be deemed not to
commence unless and until such restatement has been completed and the
applicable Bank Required Information has been amended or the Company
has announced that it has concluded that no restatement will be required, and
the requirements described in the immediately preceding sentence would be
satisfied on the first Business Day, throughout and on the last Business Day
of such new consecutive fifteen (15) Business Day period.

100 review); provided, that the filing by the Company with the SEC of the
financial statements required in its Annual Report on Form 10-K or its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable, will be deemed to satisfy
the foregoing requirements with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

avoidance of doubt, the exclusion of such dates shall not restart the Bond

purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision (or part thereof) of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement (or parts
thereof) shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision (or part thereof) is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and in an
acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

8.8 _Entire _ _Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedule and Company Disclosure Schedule, the Guarantees and the
other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreements
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any
of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein or therein, are not intended to confer upon any
other Person any rights or remedies hereunder or thereunder.

 



78

    

8.9 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of each of the other parties, and any attempt to make any such
assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent may designate
another wholly owned direct or indirect Subsidiary to be a constituent
corporation in the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, so long as Parent provides
the Company with reasonable advance written notice thereof, in which event
all references to Merger Sub in this Agreement shall be deemed references to
such other wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, except that all representations
and warranties made in this Agreement with respect to Merger Sub as of the
date of this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made
with respect to such other wholly owned Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or in part from time to time, to (a) any
parties providing Debt Financing or Bond Financing pursuant to the terms
thereof (including for the purposes of creating a security interest herein or
otherwise assigning this Agreement as collateral in respect of such Debt
Financing or Bond Financing) at any time, (b) one or more affiliates (provided
that no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder), and (c) after the Effective Time, to any Person.

8.10 _No_ _Third Party_ _Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, other than pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.9_, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Financing Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of and have
the right to enforce  _Sections 7.5_ , _7.6(b)_ , _8.10_ and _8.12(d);
provided_ , _further_ , that the Parent Related Parties shall be express third
party beneficiaries of and have the right to enforce _Sections 7.4(d)_ and
_7.5_.

drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"

limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." As used in this Agreement, references to a "party" or
the "parties" are intended to refer to a party to this Agreement or the
parties to this Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action arising in connection
herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of
the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be applicable under
conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, or, in the event such court does not have
jurisdiction, Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in

out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, and each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not to commence any

to the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal
court. Each of the parties agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of
any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
_SECTION_ __ _ 8.12(c)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each party agrees (i)
that any action of any kind or nature, whether at law or equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise, against a Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Debt Financing, Bond Financing or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby shall be brought exclusively in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the

 



80

    

 Southern District of New York sitting in New York County (and appellate
courts thereof) and each party submits for itself and its property with
respect to any such action to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii)
that service of process, summons, notice or document by registered mail
addressed to it at its address provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.3_ shall be
effective service of process against it for any such action brought in any
such court, (iii) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such Proceeding in any such court, (iv) that a final
judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
Law, (v) that the Laws of the State of New York shall govern any such
Proceeding and (vi) to irrevocably waive and hereby waives any right to a
trial by jury in any such action to the same extent such rights are waived
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.12(c)_.

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

8.14 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at Law would
exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and accordingly, (i) the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the terms hereof,
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity, (ii) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief and (iii) the parties will waive, in any
action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law.
The Companys or Parents pursuit of specific performance at any time will
not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any
other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled, including the right
to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages incurred or suffered by the
other party in the case of a breach of this Agreement involving a Willful and
Material Breach.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall not have the right to enforce
Parents obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and/or to
consummate the Transactions unless: (i) all of the conditions set forth in
_Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions to Closing that by their terms or their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to such conditions being satisfied assuming a
Closing would occur), (ii) the Company has confirmed in writing that, if
specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded, the

 



81

    

 Closing will occur, (iii) the Debt Financing (or any alternative financing
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.10_) has been funded or will be funded at
the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iv) Parent
has failed to cause the Closing to occur by the date the Closing is required
to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance as and only to the extent permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 8.14_ and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee (only
to the extent expressly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 7.4_), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance to require Parent and Merger Sub to effect the
Closing and a payment of the Parent Termination Fee.
