and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its auditors to, make available
to the Representative and its auditors all records and work papers used in
preparing the Closing Statement.

(B) If the Representative disagrees in whole or in part with the Closing
Statement, then within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Representative shall notify Parent of such disagreement in
writing (the "Notice of Disagreement"), setting forth in reasonable detail
the particulars of any such disagreement. To be effective, any such Notice of
Disagreement shall include a copy of Parent's Closing Statement marked to
indicate the specific line items of the Closing Statement that are in dispute
(the "Disputed Line Items") and shall be accompanied by the Representative's
calculation of each of the Disputed Line Items and the Representative's
revised Closing Statement setting forth its determination of the Merger
Consideration and any component thereof. All items that are not Disputed Line
Items shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder
unless the resolution of a Disputed Line Item affects an undisputed item, in
which case such undisputed item shall remain open and be considered a
Disputed Line Item to the extent of such corresponding effect. In the event
that the Representative does not provide a Notice of Disagreement within such
30-day period, the Representative shall be deemed to have accepted in full
the Closing Statement as prepared by Parent, and such Closing Statement shall
become final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder as of 5:00
P.M. EST on such thirtieth (30th) day. In the event any Notice of
Disagreement is properly and timely provided, Parent and the Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of thirty (30) days
(or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to resolve any Disputed
Line Items. During such 30-day period, Parent and the Representative shall
cooperate with each other and shall have reasonable access to the books and
records, working papers, schedules and calculations of the other used in the
preparation of the Closing Statement and the Notice of Disagreement and the
determination of the Merger Consideration and Disputed Line Items and the
officers and other employees of the other Party, in each case, to the extent
reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the resolution of the
Disputed Line Items. All Disputed Line Items agreed to during such 30-day
period shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and not subject
to further appeal. If, at the end of such period, Parent and the
Representative are unable to resolve all such Disputed Line Items, then any
such remaining Disputed Line Items shall be referred to a mutually agreeable
accounting firm of national stature (the "Accounting Firm"). Parent and the
Representative will enter into reasonable and customary arrangements for the
services to be rendered by the Accounting Firm under this
Section 2.10(b)(ii)(B), such services to be provided in the Accounting
Firm's capacity as an accounting expert and not an arbitrator.
The Accounting Firm shall be directed to determine as promptly as
practicable whether the Merger Consideration as set forth in the Closing
Statement requires adjustment. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed that,
in making such determination, it may not assign a value greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either party or smaller than the
smallest value for such item claimed by either party, and that the Accounting
Firm is only to consider matters still in dispute between Parent and
the Representative. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Representative
shall each furnish to the Accounting Firm such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the Disputed Line Items, and
shall provide interviews and answer questions, as such Accounting Firm may
reasonably request. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall be based solely on the
terms of this Agreement (including Section 2.10(a)) and the written
submissions by Parent and the Representative and not by independent review.

 

 

(C) The costs and expenses for the services of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne by the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers), on the other hand, in inverse relation to their
success with respect to any disputes submitted to the Accounting Firm
for resolution. Subject to the foregoing sentence, each party shall
be responsible for its own fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Section 2.10(b).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(D) After the Merger Consideration has been finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.10(b)(ii) (the Merger Consideration as so determined
being referred to herein as the "Final Merger Consideration"), the following
payments shall be made:

 

 

(1) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then the Surviving Corporation shall pay an amount in cash
equal to such excess to the Paying Agent (for further distribution to the
Sellers on a pro rata basis based on their respective Pro Rata Shares in
accordance with Section 2.13).

 

 

(2) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration, Parent and the Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to
the Surviving Corporation, first from the Working Capital Escrow Account, a
portion of the Working Capital Escrow Amount equal to such excess (with the
balance, if any, to be released to the Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers)); provided, that in the event the Working Capital Escrow Amount is
insufficient to satisfy a payment to be made pursuant to this
Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D)(2), the amount of such shortfall may be paid from
the Escrow Account in an amount equal to such shortfall (it being understood
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Working
Capital Escrow Amount and the Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of
recovery for any payment required to be made pursuant to this
Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D)(2)).

 

 

(E) Any amount payable pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(ii)(D) shall be paid
within ten (10) Business Days after the determination of the Final Merger
Consideration via wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in writing by the recipient thereof.

 

 

(F) Payments pursuant to this Section 2.10(b)(ii) shall be treated for all
purposes as adjustments to the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(c) Accounting Procedures. The Estimated Closing Statement, the
Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein
shall be prepared and calculated on a consolidated basis for the Group
Companies in accordance with GAAP and, to the extent consistent with GAAP,
using the same accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and
methods (with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions
and valuation and estimation methodologies) used and applied by the Group
Companies in the preparation of the Audited Balance Sheet, except that such
statements, calculations and determinations shall follow the defined terms
contained in this Agreement whether or not such terms are consistent with
GAAP.

Section 2.11 Dissenting Stockholders.

 

 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
share of Common Stock and Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is held by a Stockholder who
(i) has not voted in favor of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and (ii) who shall have otherwise perfected such holder's dissenters' rights
in accordance with and as contemplated by the applicable provisions of the
DGCL (each such Stockholder, a "Dissenting Stockholder", and each share of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder, a
"Dissenting Share") shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive the amounts payable with respect to such Common Stock and Preferred
Stock under Section 2.8, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are
granted by the applicable provisions of the DGCL; provided, however, that if
such Dissenting Stockholder fails to perfect, or effectively withdraws or
loses such holder's right to appraisal of and payment for such holder's
shares under the applicable provisions of the DGCL, each share of Common
Stock and Preferred Stock of such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the amounts payable with respect to
such Common Stock and Preferred Stock under Section 2.8, and such share of
Common Stock or Preferred Stock shall no longer be a Dissenting Share. In
such event, the Surviving Corporation shall deliver the amounts payable with
respect to such Common Stock and Preferred Stock under Section 2.8 to which
such Stockholder is entitled under this Section 2.11 (without interest) as
and when such payments are required to be made following surrender by such
Stockholder of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by such Stockholder in the
manner provided in Section 3.2.

 

 

(b) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent and the Representative of
any demands (and withdrawals of such demands) received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably, withheld, conditioned or
delayed), make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay to any Dissenting Stockholder any and all amounts due and owing to
such holder as a result of any settlement of, or determination by any court
of competent jurisdiction with respect to, such demands, as and when such
payments are required to be made following surrender by such Dissenting
Stockholder of the certificate or certificates representing the shares of
Common Stock and Preferred Stock held by such Dissenting Stockholder in the
manner provided in Section 3.2.

 

 

Section 2.12 Payments and Other Actions of Parent.

22

equal to the Group Companies' Closing Indebtedness set forth on Schedule
2.12(a) to be paid off at Closing owing to such Persons (the recipients of
such monies, being, collectively, the "Debt Payoff Recipients"), which
payments, in the aggregate, shall be sufficient to satisfy any and all
obligations of any Group Company to repay such Closing Indebtedness,
including costs and expenses related thereto;

 

 

(iv) to the accounts designated in writing by the Company prior to the
Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the portion of the Seller Expenses owing to such Persons (the
recipients of such monies, being, collectively, the "Seller
Expense Recipients"), net of any and all required withholding Taxes;

 

 

(v) to an account designated in writing by the Paying Agent prior to the

Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the Closing Cash Payment minus the Representative Expense Amount

pursuant to Article 3); and

 

 

(vii) to the accounts designated in writing by the Company prior to the
Closing Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
equal to the aggregate Option Settlement Payments (which amount (net of all
required withholding Taxes) shall be distributed by the Company to each
holder of Eligible Options in accordance with Section 2.9).

 

 

(b) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company
shall prepare and deliver to Parent a schedule (the "Allocation

payments, including the Preferred Stock Dividend Amount, and the recipients
thereof (including a list of all holders of Eligible Options as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with (i) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Eligible Options and (ii) the exercise
price for each such Eligible Options). The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that. notwithstanding the terms hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company and the Paying Agent can rely on the Allocation Schedule as setting
forth a true, complete and accurate listing of all amounts due to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Paying Agent at and after Closing.

 

 

Section 2.13 Other Payments. In order to facilitate the payment of any
funds payable to the Sellers after the Closing Date pursuant to this

Paying Agent as Merger Consideration or disbursements from the Working
Capital Escrow Account or Escrow Account and payable to such Seller in
respect of such Seller's shares of Common Stock and Preferred Stock and
Company Options, as applicable, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation (and any such cash may
be commingled with the general funds of Parent or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be), free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto (other than the claims of a Seller and its heirs,
assigns and transferees hereunder) and shall be promptly delivered to the
Surviving Corporation by the Paying Agent, and such Seller shall look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of such amounts. Each Seller who prior
to such date delivers to the Paying Agent a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal and surrenders the related Stock Certificate or Lost
Certificate Affidavit shall look only to the Paying Agent for satisfaction of
any claims related to the Merger Consideration and such other amounts (except
to the extent the Paying Agent has returned such funds to the Surviving
Corporation as contemplated above, in which case such Seller shall only look
to the Surviving Corporation as contemplated above). Any interest, dividends
or other income earned on the investment of cash held by the Paying Agent,
together with all tax and other liabilities associated therewith, shall be
for the account of the Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be liable
to any Seller for any Merger Consideration or other amounts payable to the
Sellers hereunder if delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

 

Section 3.8 Rights of Former Stockholders and Option Holders. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed as to
holders of Common Stock and Preferred Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time and no transfer of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (or
Eligible Options and Option Shares) by any such holder shall thereafter be
made or recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.2, each Stock Certificate theretofore
representing shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock (other than Excluded
Shares) shall from and after the Effective Time represent for all purposes
only the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration as described
herein and such additional amounts (if any) described herein. Until a Joinder
and other Option Surrender Forms have been executed and delivered to the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the provisions of
Section 3.3, each Eligible Option shall from and after the Effective Time
represent for all purposes only the right to receive a portion of the Merger
Consideration as described herein and such additional amounts (if any)
described herein. The Merger Consideration and such additional amounts (if
any) payable in accordance with the terms of this Article 3 shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Common
Stock and Preferred Stock (other than any Dissenting Shares) and
Eligible Options.

Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each
trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code (i) to the
Knowledge of the Company, is so qualified and (ii) has obtained a currently
effective favorable determination notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status (or the qualified status of
the master or prototype form on which it is established) from the IRS

and all subsequent legislation for which the IRS will currently issue such a

the date of such letter covering such Benefit Plan that would adversely
affect such favorable determination. The most recent determination

36  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) No plan currently or ever in the past maintained, sponsored, contributed

or 407 of ERISA and not otherwise exempt under Section 408 of ERISA, has
occurred with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

 

 

(f)   No Employee Benefit Plan provides, or reflects or represents
any liability to provide, benefits (including, without limitation, death or

any plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, (3)

forth on Schedule 4.10(f).

 

 

(g) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(g), there is no contract, plan or
arrangement covering any employee or former employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that, individually or collectively, could give rise to the
payment as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of any
amount that would not be deductible by the Company or such Subsidiary by
reason of Section 280G of the Code. For purposes of the foregoing sentence,
the term "payment" shall include (without limitation) any payment,
acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in
benefits or obligation to fund benefits. Except as set forth in Schedule
4.10(g), the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (alone or together with any other
event which, standing alone, would not by itself trigger such entitlement or
acceleration) will not (1) entitle any Person to any payment, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, or increase in benefits under or with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, (2) otherwise trigger any acceleration
(of vesting or payment of benefits or otherwise) under or with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan, or (3) trigger any obligation to fund any Employee
Benefit Plan.

 

 

(h) No action, suit or claim (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the
ordinary course) has been brought or is pending or, to the Company's
Knowledge, threatened against or with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan or
the assets or any fiduciary thereof (in that Person's capacity as a fiduciary
of such Employee Benefit Plan). Except as set forth in Schedule
4.10(h), there are no audits, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to the
Company's Knowledge, threatened by the IRS, DOL, or other Governmental Entity

deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of
the Code), such plan has been maintained and operated in material compliance
with Section 409A of the Code and the applicable IRS guidance promulgated
thereunder to the extent such plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code and
so as to avoid any tax, interest or penalty thereunder. No stock option
granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether currently
outstanding or previously exercised) is, has been or would be, as applicable,
subject to any tax, penalty or interest under Section 409A of the Code.

bound, or (c) violate any Order or Applicable Law to which Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their respective properties or assets are subject to or bound,

Section 7.2 Tax Matters.

 

 

(a) Liabilities for Taxes.

 

 

(i) Sellers shall be liable for, pay (or caused to be paid) and indemnify and
hold harmless Parent from and against all Losses with respect to Pre-Closing
Taxes imposed on the Group Companies and Sellers' portion of the Taxes
described in Section 7.2(a)(ii).

 

 

(ii) All transfer taxes, recording fees and other similar Taxes (and any
interest, penalties or additions to Tax with respect thereto) that are
imposed on any of the parties hereto by any Governmental Entity in connection
with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall be paid
by Sellers.

 

 

(iii) The obligations of Sellers to indemnify and hold harmless Parent for
Taxes (and Losses attributable thereto) pursuant to this Section 7.2
shall survive until thirty (30) days after the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to such Taxes.

 

 

(iv) Whenever Sellers shall be required to pay Parent or Parent shall be
required to pay Sellers an amount pursuant to this Section 7.2,
such payments shall be made no later than five (5) days after such payments
are requested.

 

 

(v) Parent agrees that it shall not make an election under Section 338 of the
Code (or under any similar provision of state, local or non-United States
law) with respect to its acquisition of the shares of Common Stock.

 

 

(vi) The parties hereby agree and acknowledge that Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to the benefits of any Tax deductions arising
from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the payment of Seller Expenses, option deductions, unamortized
deferred financing fees, and termination payments with respect to any
management services agreements).

 

 

(b) Tax Returns.

 

 

(i) The Company shall cause to be timely filed all Tax Returns of or with
respect to any Group Company that are due on or prior to the Closing Date,
and the Company shall cause to be timely paid any Taxes shown to be due
thereon. At least fifteen (15) days prior to filing any such Return, the
Company shall submit a copy of such Return to Parent for Parent's review and
approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall timely file or cause to
be timely filed all Tax Returns relating to the Group Companies that are due
after the Closing Date.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) Except as provided in Section 7.2(b)(i) above, Parent shall have the
exclusive authority and obligation to prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Surviving Corporation;
provided, however, that (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
provide the Representative with draft copies of Tax Returns for the Surviving
Corporation required to be prepared by Parent and the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this Section 7.2(b)(ii) for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns together
with a statement setting forth the amount of Tax for which the Sellers are
responsible pursuant to Section 7.2(a) (the "Tax Statement"), (ii) at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns,
the Representative shall notify Parent and the Surviving Corporation of the
existence of any objection the Representative may have to any items set forth
on such draft Tax Returns or Tax Statement, and (iii) if, after consulting in
good faith, Parent and the Representative are unable to resolve such
objection(s), such objection(s) shall be referred to an independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Parent and the Representative for
resolution on a basis consistent with Applicable Law with respect to
such items. If such independent accounting firm is unable to make
a determination with respect to any disputed item within five (5) days prior
to the due date for the filing of the Tax Return in question, then Parent may
file such Tax Return on the due date therefor without such determination
having been made and without the Representative's consent. Notwithstanding
the filing of such Tax Return, such independent accounting firm shall make
a determination with respect to any disputed item, and the amount of Taxes
for which the Sellers are responsible under Section 7.2(a) shall be as
determined by such independent accounting firm. The fees and expenses of such
independent accounting firm shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half by
Sellers.

 

 

(c) Contests.

 

 

(i) If a Governmental Entity asserts a claim for Taxes against a Group
Company, then the party hereto first receiving notice (whether directly, or
indirectly through an Affiliate of such party) shall promptly provide Parent,
the Surviving Corporation and the Representative written notice specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such claim, and shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Governmental Entity
in respect of any such inquiry, claim, assessment, audit or similar event
with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes for which Sellers may be liable under this
Agreement (a "Tax Matter"); provided, however, that the failure of such party
to give such prompt and detailed notice shall not relieve the other party of
any of its obligations under this Section 7.2, except if and only if to the
extent that the other party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.
The Sellers, at their sole expense, shall have the authority to represent the
interests of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any Tax Matter before
the IRS, any other Governmental Entity or any court and shall have the sole
right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax
Matter, if (i) the Representative provides to Parent a written notice in
which the Representative elects to contest, and to control the defense or
prosecution of, such Tax Matter, (ii) such Tax Matter relates solely to Taxes
for which Seller would be responsible under Section 7.2(a)(i) or Section
10.2(a) and (iii) as long as the Escrow Funds remaining in the Escrow Account
exceed the amount of such Tax Matter. The Representative shall keep Parent
and the Surviving Corporation fully and timely informed with respect to
the commencement, status and nature of any Tax Matter (including providing to
Parent copies of relevant portions of all written materials relating to such
Tax Matter). The Representative shall defend or prosecute the Tax
Matter diligently and in good faith. The Representative shall, in
good faith, allow Parent or its authorized representative to attend and
participate in, all conferences, meetings and proceedings relating to such
Tax Matter and to make comments regarding the conduct of or positions taken
in any such proceeding. The Representative shall not enter into any
settlement or compromise of any Tax Matter with any Governmental Entity that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation without the prior written consent of the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(ii) Parent shall have the sole right to control any audit or examination by
any Governmental Entity, initiate any claim for refund or amend any Tax
Return, and contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional
Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of, or relating
to, the income, assets or operations of the Surviving Corporation, for all
taxable periods ending after the Closing Date, except for an Interim Tax
Period, as to which Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall (i) keep the
Representative fully and timely informed with respect to such proceedings,
(ii) in good faith, allow the Representative to make comments to the Parent
and the Surviving Corporation regarding the conduct of or positions taken in
any such proceeding, (iii) allow the Representative, on behalf of the
Sellers, to participate at its own expense in any such proceeding, and (iv)
not enter into any settlement or compromise that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the Sellers without the prior written consent of the
Representative, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.

 

 

(d) Amended Tax Returns; Carrybacks. Except (i) as otherwise required by Law
or (ii) as would not have the effect of materially increasing a Pre-Closing
Tax Liability, neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall file or
cause to be filed any amended Tax Return or claim for refund for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of the Representative,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(e) Cooperation. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall reasonably
cooperate with the Representative, at Sellers' cost, in connection with the
filing of any Tax Return, in any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes, and in allowing the Representative to review Tax Returns of
the Group Companies for Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods to
determine or verify the proper amounts payable as refunds hereunder. Such
cooperation shall include the reasonable retention and the provision of
copies of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any materials provided hereunder. Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, retain all books and records
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
which relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (and, if notified in writing by
another party, any extensions thereof), and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity. All of such information
provided pursuant to this Section 7.2(d) shall be treated as Confidential
Information pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The
Representative, Parent and the Surviving Corporation further agree, upon
request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any Tax authority or any other Person or
take any other action as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Tax that could be imposed on any party hereto (including with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(f) Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax sharing agreement or arrangement shall
be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

 

Section 7.3 Access to Information. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (i) provide to
Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized representatives during normal
business hours reasonable access to all books, records, assets, properties
and personnel of the Group Companies (in a manner so as to not interfere with
the normal business operations of any Group Company) and (ii) furnish as
promptly as practicable to the Parent and Merger Sub and their authorized
representatives any information concerning the Group Companies that the
Parent may reasonably request. All of such information shall be treated as
Confidential Information pursuant to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
no such information shall be furnished to the extent that it would require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to disclose information subject to
attorney-client privilege or conflict with any confidentiality obligations to
which the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is bound. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, prior to the Closing, without the
prior written consent of the Company, which may be withheld for any reason,
neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall contact any suppliers to, or customers
of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that
nothing contained in this Section 7.3 shall prohibit Parent or Merger Sub
from contacting any current supplier to, or customer of, Parent or its
Affiliates or from conducting its business in the ordinary course.

 

 

Section 7.4 Efforts to Consummate.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Parties
hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly
as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set forth in
Article 8). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to notify and to obtain consents of all
Governmental Entities as necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

(b) Subject to the terms of Section 7.4(a), in the event any Proceeding by
any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages
in connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to defend against such Proceeding and, if an Order is
issued in any such Proceeding, to use commercially reasonable efforts to have
such injunction or other order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding
any other impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Section 7.5 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Sellers and the Company
shall not take, nor shall any Seller or the Company permit any of their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents or
representatives to take, any action to solicit, encourage, initiate, engage
in or continue discussions, negotiations or other communications with,
provide any information to or otherwise cooperate in any way with, or accept
any proposal or offer from, or enter into any agreement with any Person
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and/or their respective Affiliates) concerning
(i) any direct or indirect purchase of any Group Company's equity securities,
(ii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, sale of assets or similar transaction involving the Group
Companies, or (iii) any other transaction in lieu of or that conflicts with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (each such transaction, an
"Acquisition Transaction"). The Group Companies shall not release any Person
from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which any Group Company is a party, without the prior written consent of
Parent.

 

 

Section 7.6 [Reserved].

 

 

Section 7.7 Employee Benefits Matters.

 

 

(a) Parent agrees that each employee of the Company who continues employment
with Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
after the Closing Date (a "Continuing Employee") shall be provided with
benefits on substantially similar terms, in the aggregate, as benefits are
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. Nothing in this Agreement
(i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries
to continue to employ any particular Company Employee following the Closing
Date, or (ii) shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Employee Benefit
Plan.

 

 

(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Continuing
Employee receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to
participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but
excluding benefit accrual), subject to any required approval of the
applicable insurance provider, which Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to procure, for service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (or
predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any Subsidiary provides
such past service credit under its employee benefit plans) under each of the
comparable employee benefit plans, programs and policies of Parent, the
Surviving Company or the relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, in which such
Continuing Employee becomes a participant; provided, however, that no
such service recognition shall result in any duplication of benefits.
With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan maintained by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the relevant Subsidiary for the benefit of
any Continuing Employees, subject to any required approval of the
applicable insurance provider, if any, which Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to procure, Parent shall (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and
the application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan,
and (ii) cause each Continuing Employee to be given credit under such plan
for all amounts paid by such Continuing Employee under any similar Company
Employee Plan for the plan year that includes the Closing Date for purposes
of applying deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though
such amounts had been paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable plan maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary, as applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing
Date occurs.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(c) The Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Company
401(k) Plan to allow for loans to be rolled over to Purchaser's 401(k) Plan
(as defined below) (the "401(k) Rollover Amendment"). If, and only if, the
Company is able to adopt the 401(k) Rollover Amendment at least two (2) days
before the Closing Date, the Company will adopt, or will cause to be adopted,
all necessary corporate resolutions to terminate each 401(k) Plan sponsored
or maintained by the Company, effective as of no later than one day prior to
Closing (but such termination may be contingent upon the Closing).
Immediately prior to any such termination on or prior to the Closing, the
Company will make all necessary payments to: (i) make any corrective
contributions or refunds necessary or required to maintain the tax-qualified
status of the 401(k) Plan for the period prior to Closing; (ii) fund the
contributions for elective deferrals made pursuant to the 401(k) Plan for the
period prior to Closing; and (iii) fund the contributions for employer
matching contributions (if any) for the period prior to Closing. The
Company shall not be obligated to take any other action on or prior to the
Closing to effectuate or in connection with any such termination of the
Company 401(k) Plan, except as may be reasonably advisable and agreed to by
the parties. For this purpose, the term "401(k) Plan" means any plan
intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) which includes a cash or
deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Code Section 401(k). If the
Company terminates any such 401(k) Plan, the Company shall provide Parent
with a copy of resolutions duly adopted by the Company's board of directors
so terminating any such 401(k) Plan.

 

 

(d) As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing Date, each
Continuing Employee who participated in the Company 401(k) Plan as of the
Closing shall be covered by a defined contribution plan sponsored or
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Company or one of their Subsidiaries (the
"Purchaser's 401(k) Plan") intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a)
with a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Code Section
401(k), which may be the Company 401(k) Plan if the termination has not
become effective as of the Closing Date. If the Company's 401(k) Plan is
terminated prior to the Closing, and if elected by Continuing Employees, the
Company shall cause to be paid from the Company 401(k) Plan the vested
account balances of such employees in the form of cash, cash equivalents or
other mutually acceptable property and Purchaser's 401(k) Plan shall accept
such distributions as rollover distributions subject to the terms of
Purchaser's 401(k) Plan and the rules and regulations under Section 402(c) of
the Code. In no event shall any such transfer take place until the furnishing
by the Company to Parent, if requested by Parent, of a favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the
qualification of the Company 401(k) Plan. The Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to effect any such transfer of account
balances in a timely manner.

 

 

(e) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer
upon any Continuing Employee any right to continued employment for any period
or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, (ii) shall constitute
an amendment to or any other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan or
(iii) shall be construed to prohibit Parent, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan.

Section 7.8 Notification; Disclosure Supplements. From the date hereof until
the Closing Date, each of the Company and the Sellers, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall give reasonably prompt notice
to the other Parties of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event,
which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably likely to cause (a)
any representation or warranty of such party that is contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect as if such
representation and warranty were made at such time and (b) such Party to fail
to comply with or satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Person under this
Agreement. From time to time prior to the Closing, the Company may supplement
or amend the Schedules with respect to any event occurring after the date
hereof in the ordinary course of business of the Group Companies that, if
existing at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set
forth in the Schedules (such matters, the "Permitted Modifications"). The
Company shall provide any such supplemental disclosure as promptly as
practicable and in any event more than two (2) Business Days prior to
Closing. Any such Permitted Modification (x) will be deemed to have cured any
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes
of determining whether or not the condition set forth in Section 8.2(a)
shall have been satisfied as of the Closing Date (but, for purposes of
clarity, the Permitted Modifications shall be disregarded and have no effect
for the purpose of determining whether or not a Company Material Adverse
Effect shall have occurred or whether any other conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 have been satisfied), and (y) will be deemed to have been
disclosed for purposes of qualifying any of the representations and
warranties made in this Agreement as of the Closing Date for purposes of
determining whether Parent, Merger Sub and the Purchaser Indemnitees are
entitled to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of Article 10 hereof.

 

 

Section 7.9 Releases. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the

Section 7.10 Non-Solicitation.

 

 

(a) Without the consent of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, for a period
of three (3) years following the Closing Date, none of the Sellers listed on
Schedule 7.10(a) shall, and each of the Sellers listed on Schedule
7.10(a) shall cause their respective Affiliates and representatives not to,
directly or indirectly through any Person or contractual arrangement,
solicit, recruit or hire, directly or indirectly, any Person who at any time
on or after the date of this Agreement is a Group Company Employee; provided,

any breach of this Section 7.10 by its Affiliates and representatives.

 

 

(b) Due to the irreparable injury and damage to Parent resulting from any
Seller's violation of this Section 7.10, Parent shall be entitled to
injunctive relief against the violation by any Seller of this Section 7.10
in addition to any remedy otherwise available to Parent. If any court of
competent jurisdiction shall hold that the restrictions contained in this
Section 7.10 are unreasonable, such restrictions shall be deemed to be
reduced, but only to the extent necessary, in the opinion of said court, to
make them reasonable.

 

 

Section 7.11 Non-Compete/Non-Solicit.

 

 

(a) Until the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date, none of the

account or solely or jointly for the benefit of others, in any business that

"Competing Business"); (ii) solicit, directly or indirectly, any Competing
Business from any Person other than to or for the benefit of Parent or an
Affiliate of Parent; (iii) invest, either directly or indirectly, in any
Person engaged in any Competing Business; or (iv) divert, entice or otherwise
take away from the Group Companies the business or patronage of any client,
or attempt to do so, in each case, it being understood that upon consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Group Companies shall
be Affiliates of Parent; provided, that nothing contained in this Section
7.11 shall be deemed to prevent any Seller or any Affiliate thereof from
owning less than five percent (5%) of a class of stock of a publicly-held
corporation which is traded on a national securities exchange or in the over-
the-counter market, so long as such Seller or Affiliate, as applicable, with
such ownership interest does not have any active participation in the
business or management of such entity). Each Seller shall be liable for any
breach of this Section 7.11 by its Affiliates and representatives.

 

 

(b) Due to the irreparable injury and damage to Parent resulting from any
Seller's violation of this Section 7.11, Parent shall be entitled to

competent jurisdiction shall hold that the restrictions contained in this

under this Section 7.11. The amount of such allocation shall be mutually
agreed by Parent and the Representative based upon a valuation to performed
following the date hereof. Any dispute with respect to the amount of such
allocation shall be referred to the Accounting Firm and the determination of
the amount of such allocation by the Accounting Firm shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties and shall be based solely on the terms
of this Agreement and the written submissions by Parent and the
Representative and not by independent review. Parent and the Sellers agree to
report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent
therewith, and none of them will take any position inconsistent therewith in
any Tax Return, before any Governmental Entity or in any Proceeding without
the written consent of the other Parties or unless specifically required
pursuant to a legally binding determination by an applicable Governmental
Entity.

 

 

Section 7.12 Confidentiality; Publicity.

concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby will be
issued by the Company or the Sellers, on the one hand, or Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, without the prior consent of Parent

unreasonably withheld, except as such release or announcement may be required
by Applicable Law, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement will, to the extent practicable, allow the other party
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance and the parties shall use their reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued. On the Closing Date,
the parties hereto shall issue a joint press release, which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company, Parent and the Representative. Any
communication by the American Capital Parties solely to its respective
limited partners shall not be considered a "press release or announcement"
for purposes of this Section 7.12(c).

 

 

Section 7.13 Waiver and Termination of Certain Agreements. On or prior to
the Closing Date, the Company shall have delivered evidence satisfactory to
Parent of the termination of all agreements set forth on Schedule

than concurrently with the Closing, so that no Company Options shall
remain outstanding following Closing. The Company shall duly issue all
of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise of Company Options,
and shall not permit any holders of Company Options to pay the exercise price
for any Company Options using a promissory note or other loan from any

its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the resignations of all of
the officers and directors of the Group Companies listed on Schedule
7.16 effective as of the Effective Time, it being understood and agreed that
in the case of any such officer, such resignation shall represent solely such
Person's resignation from his or her official officer capacity with the
applicable Group Company, and shall not otherwise affect such Person's
employment status with any Group Company, and shall not be deemed a breach or
waiver by any such person of any rights under any employment or similar
agreement to which such Person is a party.

 

 

Section 7.17 Exculpation; Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification for acts

employees of the Group Companies and the respective Affiliates of any of such
directors, officers or other employees currently indemnified by the Acquired
Companies (collectively, the "Covered Persons") as provided in their
respective Governing Documents, indemnity agreements or as provided pursuant
to a resolution of the board of directors of the Group Companies, as
applicable, in each case solely to the extent that the Group Companies have
made such documents available to Parent prior to the date hereof, shall
survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and be obligations of
the Group Companies and shall continue in full force and effect in

coverage as in effect as of the date hereof, covering claims arising from
facts or events which occurred at or prior to the Closing.

the obligations of the Group Companies to indemnify (including any
obligations to advance funds for expenses) the Covered Persons for acts or
omissions by such Covered Persons occurring prior to or as of the Closing
Date to the extent that such obligations of the Group Companies, as
applicable, exist on the date of this Agreement (and if any statute is
amended to provide for benefits that are more favorable to the Covered
Persons, then each Covered Person shall be entitled to the benefits of such
amendment), whether pursuant to the Governing Documents of the Group
Companies, indemnity agreements, board resolution or otherwise, in each case
solely to the extent that the Group Companies have made such documents
available to Parent prior to the date hereof, and such obligations shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of such Governing Documents, board resolutions or indemnity
agreements from the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such Covered
Persons arising out of such acts or omissions. The Governing Documents of the
Group Companies shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
reimbursement, contribution, hold harmless and exculpation from liability
that are no less favorable to the Covered Persons than those set forth in the
Group Companies' Governing Documents on the date of this Agreement, solely to
the extent that the Group Companies have made such documents available to
Parent prior to the date hereof.

 

 

(d) After the Closing, in the event that all or substantially all of the
business, stock or assets of Parent or the Group Companies is sold, whether
by merger, consolidation, sale of assets or securities or otherwise, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, then Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, in each such case, take action to ensure that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Group Companies, as applicable,
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.17. The provisions of
this Section 7.17(d) shall apply to all of the successors and assigns of
Parent and the Surviving Corporations.

 

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.17 are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to
indemnification under this Section 7.17, and each such Person's heirs,
legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed
that such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.17,
and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification, reimbursement or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

necessary in connection with any Tax inquiry, audit, investigation or
dispute, any litigation or investigation or any other matter requiring any
such Information or employees for any reasonable business purpose. For
purposes of this Section 7.18, "Information" shall mean (a) all records of

of the Group Companies prior to the Closing; (b) all records pertaining to
the business, customers, suppliers or personnel of the Group Companies prior

hereof and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
obtaining any Permits, consents, authorizations, approvals of, or effecting

(B) in any certificate or other instrument or document delivered by the
Company to Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement; provided, that
for the purposes of the foregoing clause (except with respect to the
representation set forth in Section 4.7(i)), qualifications as to
materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or other qualifiers of similar
import contained in such representations and warranties shall not be given
effect for determining whether a breach of such representations and
warranties has occurred or for purposes of calculating any Losses, (ii) any
breach by the Sellers or the Representative or, prior to Closing, the Company
of any of their respective covenants or agreements contained herein, (iii)
any and all Losses with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes of the Group Companies,
(iv) any payment in respect of Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such
Dissenting Shares in accordance with this Agreement had such Sellers not
pursued their rights to appraisal under the DGCL, and any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with any Proceeding in
respect of any Dissenting Shares, (v) the failure of any item set forth in
the Allocation Schedule to be accurate, true and correct in all respects as
of the Closing, including the failure to properly set forth the Estimated
Price Per Share pursuant to Section 2.10(b)(i), the amount of any Closing
Indebtedness or Seller Expenses not taken into account in the calculation of
the Estimated Merger Consideration or the calculation of the Preferred Stock
Dividend Amount, and (vi) any claims by (x) any Seller relating to or arising
out of the misallocation of Merger Consideration among the Sellers by the
Company, the Representative or the Paying Agent (including payments made by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation at the direction of the Representative
or the Paying Agent and the misallocation of distributions to the Sellers out
of the Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount, if any) and (y)
any Person after the Effective Time for payment relating to equity securities
of Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (including the Eligible Options). None of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation shall have any liability with respect to the allocation
and payment of proceeds to the former holders of Common Stock or Preferred
Stock and the former holders of Options resulting from any payments made to
such former holders pursuant to this Agreement. The Sellers and the
Representative hereby covenant not to sue Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation for any Losses resulting from their respective reliance on such
directions, which includes reliance on the Allocation Schedule.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 10.2, from and after the
Closing, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold each Seller and their respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees partners, stockholders, agents and
representatives, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of
any of the foregoing (each a "Seller Indemnitee") harmless from any Loss
incurred that arises out of or results, directly or indirectly, from (i) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub (A)
contained in this Agreement or (B) in any certificate or other instrument or
document delivered to the Company or the Representative pursuant to this
Agreement, and (ii) any breach by Parent of any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein and (iii) any breach by the Surviving Corporation
of any of its covenants or agreements contained herein which are to be
performed by the Surviving Corporation after the Closing Date.

 

 

(c) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless pursuant to this Section
10.2 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
for the applicable periods set forth in Section 10.1, except for claims for
indemnification asserted prior to the end of an applicable period (which
claims shall survive until final resolution thereof).

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any Seller
fails to execute this Agreement or a Joinder prior to the Closing, each
Seller that has executed this Agreement or a Joinder by such time shall
assume its Pro Rata Share of all such non-executing Sellers' indemnification
obligations pursuant to this Section 10.2. Solely for purposes of the
immediately preceding sentence, both the numerator and the denominator of the
definition of "Pro Rata Share" shall be interpreted so as to give no effect
to the number of shares of Capital Stock and Option Shares held by each
Seller that is not a party to this Agreement, determined at the time such
Losses are paid by the Seller Indemnifying Parties.

 

 

Section 10.3 Inter-Party Claims. In order for a Purchaser Indemnitee or a
Seller Indemnitee (each, an "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to this Article X, the Indemnified Party shall
provide the other Party or Parties from whom such indemnification is sought
(the "Indemnifying Party") a Notice of Claim promptly after occurrence of the
event giving rise to such Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification;
provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure or the indemnification obligations are
materially increased as a result of such failure. The Indemnified Party and
its Affiliates shall thereupon provide the Indemnifying Party upon request
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to
the books, records and assets of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
that evidence or support such claim or the act, omission or occurrence giving
rise to such claim and the right, upon prior notice during normal business
hours, to interview any executive officer of the Indemnified Party with
knowledge of the factual circumstances underlying such claim at a mutually
convenient time if reasonably necessary for the Indemnifying Party to
evaluate such claim. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability with
respect to any such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
shall proceed to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with
Article 12.

Section 10.4 Third Party Claims.

 

 

(a) If a Proceeding (other than a Proceeding with respect to Taxes, which
shall be governed by Section 7.2(c)) is initiated by a Person who is not a
party hereto or an Affiliate thereof (a "Third Party Claim") against an
Indemnified Party, and if such Person intends to seek indemnity with respect
thereto under this Section 10.4(a), such Indemnified Party shall within
fifteen (15) days give a Notice of Claim to the Indemnifying Party; provided
that the failure to give such Notice of Claim shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent (and
only to the extent) that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in
connection therewith; provided, that the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if in the good faith, reasonable opinion of Parent after
consultation with counsel, a Third Party Claim against a Purchaser Indemnitee
or a Group Company (i) involves an issue or matter which would reasonably be
expected, if adversely determined, to adversely affect such Purchaser
Indemnitee or Group Company, other than as a result of monetary damages, or
(ii) involves a claim that the Representative could not control without there
being a conflict of interest (as determined in good faith after consultation
with counsel), in each case, Parent shall have the right to control the
defense or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the conduct of the defense, so long as the Indemnifying Party
is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party
shall not pay or settle any such claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
conduct the defense and settlement of a Third Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle such Third Party
Claim; provided that in such event it shall waive any right to indemnity by
the Indemnifying Party for all Losses related to such claim unless the
Indemnifying Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days after the receipt of the Indemnified Party's Notice of Claim hereunder
that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not
thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. If
the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party before entering into any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third
Party Claim unless such settlement, compromise or discharge by its terms (i)
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Losses, if any, in
connection with such Third Party Claim, (ii) does not impose any injunctive
or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (iii) expressly
and unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from all Liabilities with
respect to such claim, without prejudice.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) All of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation (or a duly
authorized representative of such party) shall (and shall cause the Group
Companies to) furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may
be reasonably requested in connection therewith. 

 

 

Section 10.5 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. Other than with
respect to Losses related to breaches of Fundamental Representations and
Section 4.15, the rights of the Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification
pursuant to the provision of Section 10.2(a)(i) are subject to the following
limitations:

 

 

(a) the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses for
claims made with respect to breaches of the Non-Fundamental Representations
(other than breaches of Section 4.15, Losses with respect to which
shall not be subject to the limitation in this clause (a)) pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) until (i) the Losses relating to or arising out of the
same or related facts, events or circumstances exceed $7,500 (any other claim
for Losses, a "Minor Claim") and (ii) the total amount which the Purchaser
Indemnitees would recover under Section 10.2(a)(i), excluding all Minor
Claims (as limited by the provisions of Section 10.6), but for this
Section 10.5(a), exceeds $990,000 (the "Threshold"), in which case the
Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover the aggregate amount of
all such Losses (including the amount up to the Threshold), subject to
the other limitations herein;

 

 

(b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the amount of
Losses for claims made with respect to breaches of the Non-Fundamental
Representations (other than breaches of Section 4.15, Losses with
respect to which shall not be subject to the limitation in this clause (b))
that may be recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be limited,
individually and in the aggregate, by application to the Escrow Amount; and
in no event shall the Purchaser Indemnitees be entitled to recover more than
the Escrow Amount for claims made with respect to breaches of Non-Fundamental
Representations (other than claims for breaches of Section 4.15) pursuant
to Section 10.2(a)(i) in the aggregate.

 

 

Section 10.6 Limitation on Damages; Certain Other Restrictions on
Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in the definition of "Losses" with respect to lost
profits and diminution in value, no party hereto shall be liable for any
punitive, special, consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary or remote
damages or Losses based thereon (other than those required to be paid to a
third party as part of a Third Party Claim).


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

72  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
Purchaser Indemnitee shall have any right to indemnification under this
Article 10 with respect to any Losses solely to the extent that such Losses
are duplicative of Losses that have previously been recovered by such
Purchaser Indemnitee under this Article 10.

 

 

(c) The amount of any and all Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this Article 10 shall be determined net of (i) any amounts actually
recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees under insurance policies or other
collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person which are
contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such Losses, in each
case, net of the present value of any increases in premiums and net of any
costs of collection, deductibles, retroactive premium adjustment,
reimbursement obligation or other cost resulting from making any claim
thereunder and (ii) any Tax benefits actually realized by the Purchaser
Indemnitees in the taxable year in which such Losses were incurred.

 

 

(d) In connection with any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section
10.2(a), but subject to Section 10.2(d), each Seller shall only be severally
liable for his, her or its Pro Rata Share of any Losses (individually or in
the aggregate), and no Seller shall be responsible for aggregate Losses in
excess of his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount; provided, that
with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty contained in Article
5 or a covenant by any Seller hereunder, only such particular Seller shall be
liable for Losses arising in connection with such breach, and the parties
agree that no other Seller shall be liable hereunder for any such breach.

 

 

(e) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) for any Loss to the extent of the dollar
amount of such Loss that was taken into account (i) as an add-back to the
Merger Consideration or (ii) in calculating Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Working Capital and Seller Expenses, in each case as finally determined
pursuant to Section 2.10.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
amount of Losses that may be recovered by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant
to any and all claims made under this Agreement shall be limited,
individually and in the aggregate, to the Merger Consideration other than in
the case of fraud.

 

 

Section 10.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except (i) in the case of fraud, (ii)
with respect to the matters covered by Sections 2.10(b) or Section 7.2
and (iii) in the case where a party seeks to obtain specific
performance pursuant to Section 12.14, from and after the Closing the rights
of the Parties to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of this Article
10 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for the Parties with respect to any
matter in any way arising from or relating to this Agreement or its
subject matter. Each Party hereby waives any provision of law to the
extent that it would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this
Section 10.7.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 10.8 Manner of Payment; Escrow.

 

 

(a) Any indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees pursuant to this Article 10 shall be effected by wire transfer
of immediately available funds from the applicable Persons to an account
designated in writing by the applicable Purchaser Indemnitees or Seller
Indemnitees, as the case may be, within 15 days after the determination
thereof; provided, however, that any indemnification owed by Sellers to the
Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i) (other than with respect
to Losses related to breaches of Fundamental Representations
and Section 4.15), shall be satisfied solely from the remaining portion of
the Escrow Amount. Except as set forth in the proviso above, any
indemnification owed by the Sellers to the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 10.2(a)(i) shall be satisfied first from the remaining portion of the
Escrow Amount and thereafter by the Sellers directly. Any indemnification
owed by the Seller to the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section
10.2(a)(i) that is to be satisfied from the Escrow Amount shall be reduced by
5.05% (in order to reflect the release to the Company of amounts held back
from bonuses or other amounts payable by the Group Companies pursuant to the
triVIN Holdings, Inc. 2010 Management Incentive Plan (the "MIP")); provided,
for the avoidance of doubt, that upon the release of the funds in the Escrow
Account pursuant to Section 10.8(b), the obligation to release any remaining
bonuses or other amounts held back pursuant to the MIP shall be the
obligation of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

(b) Any funds remaining in the Escrow Account as of the Release Date (other
than the aggregate amount claimed by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to
claims made and not fully resolved prior to such date) shall be released to
the Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). At any time following
the Release Date, to the extent the funds held in the Escrow Account exceed
the aggregate amount claimed by the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to claims
made prior to the Release Date, and not fully resolved prior to the time
of determination, the excess funds shall be promptly released to
the Representative.

 

 

(c) The Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make
any distributions from the Escrow Account expressly provided herein. Except
as otherwise required pursuant to a determination within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, Sellers shall be treated as the owners of the
Escrow Account for all tax purposes.

 

 

Section 10.9 Tax Classification of Indemnification Payments.
All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made,
taking into account any Tax costs associated with respect to such
indemnification payments. The parties hereto agree to treat any
indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to
the purchase price for all tax purposes, except as otherwise required
pursuant to a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

 

 

Section 10.10 Right to Indemnification Not Affected by Knowledge. The right
to indemnification and payment of Losses based on any breach of
representations, warranties or covenants will not be affected by any
investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation and/or warranty
and/or covenant. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, payment
of Losses, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section 10.11 No Contribution. No Indemnifying Party or any of its employees
or agents shall have any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against any Group Company in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which she, he or it may
become subject under or in connection with this Agreement.

waiver of any such right or interest by the Representative or by such Seller
unless such waiver is in writing signed by the Representative; and

 

 

(vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to
do any and all things and to take any and all action that the Representative,
in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or
convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and all other agreements, documents
or instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection
herewith and therewith.

 

 

(b) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any

Section 12.3   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, irrespective
of the principal place of business, residence or domicile of the Parties
hereto, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware.

 

 

Section 12.4  Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions

Section 12.5  Construction; Interpretation. The term "this Agreement" means
this Agreement and Plan of Merger together with all Schedules and Exhibits
hereto, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented
or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No party hereto, nor
its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for
purposes of construing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly
for or against any party. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary herein
by the context or use thereof: (i) the words, "herein," "hereto," "hereof"
and words of similar import refer to this Agreement as a whole, including
the Schedules and Exhibits, and not to any particular section, subsection
paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained in this Agreement; (ii) masculine
gender shall also include the feminine and neutral genders, and vice
versa; (iii) words importing the singular shall also include the plural, and
vice versa; and (iv) the words "include," "includes," "including" and
"inclusive of" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation".

 

 

Section 12.6  Exhibits and Schedules. All exhibits and Schedules or other
documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated
into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full
in this Agreement. Subject to the definition of Company Material
Adverse Effect, any item disclosed on any Schedule referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement (other than with respect to Schedule
1.1(c)) if the relevance of such disclosure to such other section is
reasonably apparent on its face. The specification of any dollar amount in
the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the
inclusion of any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that
such amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other
items, are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the
setting of such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described
herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.7  Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in Section 7.17 and Article 10, nothing in
this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 

 

Section 12.8  Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.

 

 

Section 12.9   Amendment. Prior to the Effective Time, subject to Applicable
Law (including the DGCL) and Section 12.10, this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by a written agreement executed and delivered by duly
authorized officers of Parent, Merger Sub and either the Company or the
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). After the Effective Time, subject
to Applicable Law (including the DGCL), this Agreement may be amended or
modified only by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized
officers of the Surviving Corporation and the Representative. This Agreement
may not be modified or amended except as provided in the immediately
preceding two sentences and any purported amendment by any party or parties
hereto effected in a manner which does not comply with this Section 12.9
shall be void.

Section 12.10 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, the
Company or the Representative (in each case, on behalf of itself and Sellers)
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by
Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by Parent or
Merger Sub with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. At any
time prior to the Closing, Parent may (i) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or other acts of the Company or Sellers contained
herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the Company and Sellers contained herein or in any document, certificate or
writing delivered by the Company or Sellers pursuant hereto or (iii)
waive compliance by the Company and Sellers with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument signed on behalf of such party (or in the case of a
Seller, signed on behalf of such Seller by the Company or the
Representative). The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

 

Section 12.11 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by

Section 12.12 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II)
IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE
PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS
RELATED HERETO, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
SECTIONS 2.10(B), 7.2(B)(II) AND 7.11(C) ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION, OR
CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF
THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 12.13 Jurisdiction and Venue.

 

 

(a) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTIONS 2.10(B), 7.2(B)(II) AND 7.11(C),
EACH OF THE PARTIES SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR
FEDERAL COURT SITTING IN DELAWARE IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AGREES
THAT ALL CLAIMS IN RESPECT OF THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND
DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY IN ANY OTHER COURT. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF
INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT
AND WAIVES ANY BOND, SURETY OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF ANY
OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUMMONS
AND COMPLAINT OR ANY OTHER PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE SERVED IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE ON SUCH PARTY BY SENDING OR DELIVERING A COPY OF THE
PROCESS TO THE PARTY TO BE SERVED AT THE ADDRESS OF THE PARTY AND IN THE
MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF NOTICES IN SECTION 12.2. NOTHING IN THIS
SECTION 12.13, HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE
LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A
FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT SHALL
BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER
MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

 

 

Section 12.14 Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein
(including Section 9.2 and Section 10.7), any and all remedies provided
herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
Each of the Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event
that such parties hereto do not perform their respective obligations under
the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach
such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that each of the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy at law
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

82  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement and Plan of
Merger to be duly executed on its behalf as of the day and year first above
written.
