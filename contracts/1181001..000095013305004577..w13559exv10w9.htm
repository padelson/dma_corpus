will be used in computing the Adjustment Amount. If Buyer gives such notice of objection, and the

would be measured if the Company were not acquired by Buyer and instead continued to operate in the
Ordinary Course of Business. It will be rebuttably presumed that extraordinary expenses will be
excluded from the determination of EBITDA for each Deferred Payment Period, and the types of

extraordinary signing bonuses paid to a prospective employee of the Company, any extraordinary
expenses that are incurred by the Company in connection with the acquisition of a book of business

consistent application throughout the periods involved of customary and sound accounting principles
Seller reasonably believes to be used in preparing internal financial statements in the insurance
