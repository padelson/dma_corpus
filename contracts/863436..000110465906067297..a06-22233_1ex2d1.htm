AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of October 16,
2006, among BENCHMARK ELECTRONICS, INC., a Texas corporation (" _Parent_ "),
AUTOBAHN ACQUISITION CORP., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and PEMSTAR INC., a Minnesota corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub has
approved, and a special committee of the Companys Board of Directors (the "
_Special Committee_ ") formed in accordance with Section 302A.673 of the
Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") has approved, this
Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other
than any shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by Parent, Sub or the
Company, will be converted into the right to receive common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ");

  

WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company and the Special Committee have
determined that the Merger is fair to and in the best interests of the
shareholders of the Company;

  

WHEREAS for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the
Merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), (b) this Agreement will
constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of
the Code and (c) Parent, Sub and the Company will each be a party to such
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(b) of the Code; and

  

WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

# **ARTICLE I**

  

# ** _The Merger_**

  

## SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the MBCA, Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (as defined
in Section 1.03 below). Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of Sub shall  

   

cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Sub in accordance with the MBCA.

  

## SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_
") will take place at 10:00 a.m. on a date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of
Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York,
New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions
set forth in Article VI shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent
permitted by law) waived on such second business day, then the Closing shall
take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall have
been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by law) waived. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_
".

  

## SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Minnesota articles of merger (the
" _Articles of Merger_ ") executed and acknowledged by the parties in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the MBCA and, as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Minnesota, or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
shall specify in the Articles of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

  

## SECTION 1.04. _Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 302A.641 of the MBCA.

  

## SECTION 1.05. _Articles of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) The Amended
Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company Articles_ ") shall
be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A and, as so
amended, such Company Articles shall be the Amended Articles of Incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable law.

  

### (b) The By-laws of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

  

## SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

     

   

## SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of Sub immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

  

# **ARTICLE II**

  

# ** _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_**

  

## SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares
of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Parent or Sub:

  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share
of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, Parent or
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

  

### (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Subject to Section 2.02(e), each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.01(b)) shall be converted into the right to receive 0.16 (the
" _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any
such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.02(e), in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b),
without interest. As provided in Section 2.02(j), the right of any holder of
a Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under applicable
tax law.

  

### (d) _Anti-Dilution Provisions._ In the event Parent changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction, or issues a special cash dividend,

     

   

with respect to the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, shares of Parent Common
Stock payable as part of the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such stock split (including a reverse split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction or special cash
dividend.

  

## SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates._ (a) _Exchange Agent._ As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in trust with Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. or such other bank or trust company as may be designated by
Parent (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, any dividends or other distributions with
respect thereto with a record date after the Effective Time and any cash
payments in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares
of Parent Common Stock, dividends or other distributions and cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures._ As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), (i) a form of letter
of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates held by such person shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c)
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). Each holder of record of a
Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(x) uncertificated shares of Parent Common Stock registered on the stock
transfer books of Parent in the name of such holder (the " _Registered Parent
Shares_ ") or, at the election of such holder, certificates, in each case
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
after taking into account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by
such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered and (y) any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.02(c) and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e), and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the proper

     

   

amount of cash, if any, and Registered Parent Shares or certificates
representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, as the case
may be, may be paid and issued to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if, upon presentation to
the Exchange Agent, such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such issuance shall
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of any cash
and the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such taxes have been paid or are not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate
shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the
right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this Article II and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e). No interest will be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II.

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends
or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the surrender thereof,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(e), in each case until
the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate in accordance
with this Article II. Following surrender of any Certificate, there shall be
issued or paid to the record holder of such Certificate, Registered Parent
Shares or certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, as the case may be, and, without interest, (i)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.02(e) and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such Registered Parent Shares or whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such Registered Parent Shares or whole
shares of Parent Common Stock.

  

### (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All shares of
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance
with the terms of this Article II (together with any dividends or
other distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash paid in lieu
of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(e)) shall be deemed to have
been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates.
At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     

   

If after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

### (e) _No Fractional Shares._ (i) No Registered Parent Shares
or certificates or scrips, in each case representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock, shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividends or other distributions of Parent shall relate to
such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a shareholder of
Parent.

  

##### (ii) In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay
to each holder of a Certificate an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such
holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held at
the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the per
share closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date, as such price
is reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the " _NYSE_ ") Composite
Transactions Tape (as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other
source as the parties shall agree in writing).

  

### (f) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for nine
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with
this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall
remain liable for, payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration and
any dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent Common
Stock and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with this Article II.

  

### (g) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of
any shares of Parent Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions
with respect thereto or cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock or cash from the Exchange Fund, in each case delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to
two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which any Merger Consideration (and all dividends or other distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to this Article II) would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Federal, state, local or
foreign government, any court, administrative, regulatory or other
governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental self-
regulatory agency, commission or authority (each, a " _Governmental Entity_
")), any such Merger Consideration (and such dividends, distributions and
cash) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the
property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

     

   

### (h) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent.

  

### (i) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions to which the holder of
such Certificate would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and cash in
lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(e).

  

### (j) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for

# ** _Representations and Warranties_**

  

## SECTION 3.01. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except
as set forth in the disclosure schedule (with specific reference to the
particular Section or subsection of this Agreement to which the information
set forth in such disclosure schedule relates; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any information set forth in one section of such disclosure schedule shall
be deemed to apply to each other Section or subsection thereof or hereof to
which its relevance is readily apparent on its face) delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Sub as follows:

  

### (a) _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power._ Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has been duly organized, and is validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
formation, as the case may be, and has all requisite power and authority and
possesses all governmental licenses, permits, authorizations and approvals
necessary to enable it to use its corporate or other name and to own, lease
or otherwise hold and operate its properties and other assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted and as currently proposed by its

     

   

management to be conducted, except where the failure to have such government
licenses, permits, authorizations or approvals individually or in the
aggregate has not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership,
leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed individually or in the aggregate has not had and could
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, complete and accurate copies of the Company Articles and its
Amended and Restated By-laws (the " _Company By-laws_ "), and the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended
to the date hereof. The Company has made available to Parent complete and
accurate copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not yet
been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of the shareholders of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, the Boards of Directors of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries and the committees of each of such Boards of
Directors, in each case held since January 1, 2003 and prior to the date
hereof.

  

### (b) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
lists each of the Subsidiaries of the Company and, for each such Subsidiary,
the jurisdiction of incorporation or formation and, as of the date hereof,
each jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is qualified or licensed to do
business. All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
equity interests in, each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the
Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, encumbrances or
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_
"), and free of any restriction on the right to vote, sell or otherwise
dispose of such capital stock or other equity interests. Except for the
capital stock of, or voting securities or equity interests in, its
Subsidiaries, the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital
stock of, or other voting securities or equity interests in, any corporation,
partnership, joint venture, association or other entity.

  

### (c) _Capital Structure._ The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 150,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Company Preferred
Stock_ "). At the close of business on October 13, 2006, (i) 45,449,433

Stock Option Plan, the Company 1997 Stock Option Plan, the Company Amended
and Restated 1999 Stock Option Plan, the Company 2000 Stock Option Plan and
the Company 2002 Stock Option Plan (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_
"), of which 2,925,854 shares of Company Common Stock were subject to
outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (collectively,
and including any options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted
after October 13, 2006, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, " _Company
Stock Options_ "), (iii) no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding or were held by the Company as treasury

     

   

shares and (iv) 5,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock designated as
Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance in
connection with the rights (the " _Rights_ ") to be issued pursuant to the
Rights Agreement, dated as of August 11, 2000, between the Company and Wells

forth above in this Section 3.01(c), at the close of business on October
13, 2006, no shares of capital stock or other voting securities or equity

performance units, rights to receive shares of Company Common Stock on a
deferred basis or other rights (other than Company Stock Options) that are

Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and accurate list, as of
October 13, 2006, of all outstanding Company Stock Options under the Company
Stock Plans, the number of unpurchased shares of Company Common Stock subject

Stock Options with exercise prices on a per share basis lower than $5.00 and
the weighted average exercise price of such Company Stock Options. All
Company Stock Options are evidenced by stock option agreements in the forms
set forth in Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and no stock
option agreement contains terms that are inconsistent with such forms. With
respect to the Company Stock Options, (A) each grant of a Company Stock
Option was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such
Company Stock Option was by its terms to be effective (the " _Grant Date_ ")
by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable, approval by the
Board of Directors of the Company (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof) and any required shareholder approval by the necessary
number of votes or written consents, and the award agreement governing such
grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party thereto, (B)
each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all other applicable statutes, laws,
ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees,
judgments or stipulations (" _Legal Provisions_ "), including the rules and
regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market and its predecessor markets ("
_Nasdaq_ ") or any other exchange on which Company securities are traded, (C)
the per share exercise price of each Company Stock Option was equal to the
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant
Date and (D) each such grant was properly accounted for in accordance with
GAAP in the audited financial statements included in the Filed Company SEC
Documents and disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents in accordance with
the Exchange Act and all other applicable Legal Provisions. The Company has
terminated the Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_Company ESPP_ "), and no employee of the Company has any rights to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Company ESPP. All outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares which may be
issued pursuant to the Company Stock Options will be, when issued in
accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and not

other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible

matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote.  Except as set forth
above in this Section 3.01(c), (x) there are not issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding (A) any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company, (B) any securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable or

sold, any such securities of any Subsidiary of the Company.

  

### (d) _Authority; Noncontravention._ The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and, subject to
receipt of the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock at the meeting of the Companys shareholders
(the " _Shareholders  Meeting_") or any adjournment or postponement thereof

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the

delivery by each of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
reorganization or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally
and the availability of equitable remedies and (ii) the remedy of specific

otherwise), properties, assets or results of operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or of a nature required to be filed as
an exhibit to a report or filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. None of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other party
thereto is in violation of or in default under (nor does there exist any
condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice or both
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract, to which it
is a party or by which it or any of its properties or other assets is bound,
except for violations or defaults that individually or in the aggregate have
not had and could not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.  None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered
into any Contract with any Affiliate of the Company that is currently in
effect other than agreements that are disclosed in the Filed Company SEC
Documents. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or
otherwise bound by any agreement or covenant (A) restricting the Companys or
any of its Affiliates ability to compete or by any agreement or covenant
restricting in any respect the research, development, distribution, sale,
supply, license, marketing or manufacturing of products or services of the
Company or any of its Affiliates, (B) containing a right of first refusal,

3.01(n), respectively, and except as set forth in the Filed Company SEC
Documents, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all
applicable Legal Provisions, except for failures to be in compliance that
individually or in the aggregate have not had and could not reasonably be

filings, franchises, licenses, notices and permits of or with
all Governmental Entities (collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary for it to
own, lease or operate its properties and other assets and to carry on its
business and operations as presently conducted and as currently proposed by
its management to be conducted, except where the failure to have such
Permits individually or in the aggregate has not had and could not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred no
default under, or violation

     

   

of, any such Permit, except for any such default or violation that
individually or in the aggregate has not had and could not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The consummation of the
Merger, in and of itself, would not cause the revocation or cancellation of
any such Permit that individually or in the aggregate could reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No material action,
demand, requirement or investigation by any Governmental Entity and
no material suit, action or proceeding by any other person, in each case
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties or other assets under any Legal Provision, is pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

any of its Subsidiaries is in material violation of, or has any material
liability under, any Environmental Law or (z) written request for information
pursuant to any Environmental Law; (B)(y) each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries has obtained and is in compliance in all material respects with

Laws; (D) there have been no Releases (as defined in clause (iii) below) of
any Hazardous Material (as defined in clause (iii) below) that
could reasonably be expected to form the basis of any material Environmental

any Person whose liabilities for such Environmental Claims the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has, or may have, retained or assumed, either
contractually or by operation of law; (E) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of
law, any liabilities or obligations that could reasonably be expected to form
the basis of any material Environmental Claim against or affecting the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (F) none of the operations of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective products requires, or
is reasonably expected to require, a material expenditure in order to comply
with the requirements of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment

(2002/95/ED) or of any similar Environmental Law restricting the manufacture,
sale, distribution, use, handling, disposal or recycling of electrical and
electronic equipment or products containing hazardous substances, and none of
such requirements could reasonably be expected to result in a material
restriction on the operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
currently conducted; (G) there are no facts, circumstances or conditions that
could reasonably be expected

     

   

##### to form the basis for any material Environmental Claim against or

3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete and
accurate list of each Company Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension

herein as a " _Company Pension Plan_ "), each Company Benefit Plan that is an
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) and all
other Company Benefit Plans and each Company Benefit Agreement. The Company
has provided to, or has made available to, Parent complete and accurate
copies of (A) each Company Benefit Plan (or, in the case of any unwritten
Company Benefit Plans, descriptions thereof) and each Company Benefit
Agreement, (B) the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 required to be

each of the Company Benefit Plans is in compliance in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
Legal Provisions, including Legal Provisions of foreign jurisdictions, and
the terms of all collective bargaining agreements.

  

##### (ii) Each Company Pension Plan intended to be tax-qualified has been

a determination letter, to the effect that such Company Pension Plan is
qualified and exempt from Federal income taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code, no such determination letter has been
revoked (nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been
threatened) and no event has occurred since the date of the most
recent determination letter or application therefor relating to any such
Company Pension Plan that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualification of such Company Pension Plan or materially increase the
costs relating thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA. All
Company Pension Plans required to have been approved by any foreign
Governmental Entity have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked
(nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened) and no
event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application
therefor relating to any such Company Pension Plan that could reasonably be
expected to materially affect any such approval relating thereto or
materially increase the costs relating thereto. The Company has delivered to
Parent a complete and accurate copy of the most recent determination letter

as well as a complete and accurate copy of each pending application for a
determination letter, if any. The Company has also provided to Parent a

##### (iv) All reports, returns and similar documents with respect to all
Company Benefit Plans required to be filed with any Governmental Entity or

##### filed or distributed in all material respects. None of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of, and to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no investigations by any Governmental Entity with respect
to, termination proceedings or other claims (except claims for benefits
payable in the normal operation of the Company Benefit Plans), suits or
proceedings against or involving any Company Benefit Plan or asserting any
rights or claims to benefits under any Company Benefit Plan that could give
rise to any material liability, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there
are not any facts that could give rise to any material liability in the event
of any such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.

  

##### (v) All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or in

Company SEC Documents.

  

##### (vi) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, (A) there has not
occurred any prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective employees, or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of such Company
Benefit Plan, or any agent of the foregoing, has engaged that could
reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective employees, or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
a trustee, administrator or other fiduciary of any trust created under
any Company Benefit Plan, to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I
of ERISA and (B) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to
the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary
of any Company Benefit Plan nor any agent of any of the foregoing, has
engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner, or failed to act in a
manner, that could reasonably be expected to subject the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any trustee,
administrator or other fiduciary, to any liability for breach of fiduciary
duty under ERISA or any other applicable law. No Company Benefit Plan or
related trust has been terminated during the last five years, nor has there
been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA) for which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan during the last five years, and no notice
of a reportable event will be required to be filed in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

##### (vii) Section 3.01(l)(vii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule discloses
whether each Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan is
(A) unfunded or self-insured, (B) funded through a "welfare benefit fund", as
such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, or other funding
mechanism or (C) insured. Each such employee welfare benefit plan may be
amended or

     

   

##### terminated (including with respect to benefits provided to retirees
and other former employees) without material liability to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries at any time after the Effective Time. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries complies in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code, Sections 601-609 of ERISA and
any similar state or local law with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that
is a group health plan, as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code or such state or local law. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any material obligations for retiree health or life
insurance benefits under any Company Benefit Plan (other than for
continuation coverage required under Section 4980B(f) of the Code).

  

##### (viii) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
obtaining of the Shareholder Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any termination of
employment on or following the Effective Time will (A) entitle any current or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to severance or termination compensation or benefits, (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding
(through a grantor trust or otherwise), of compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise or (C)
result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. The total amount of all cash compensation
and benefit payments and the fair market value of all non-cash benefits
(other than Company Stock Options) that may become payable or provided to any
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
the Company Benefit Agreements (assuming for such purpose that such
individuals employment were terminated immediately following the Effective
Time as if the Effective Time were the date hereof) will not exceed the
amount set forth in Section 3.01(l)(viii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

  

##### (ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any material
liability or obligations, including under or on account of a Company Benefit
Plan, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and treating such persons as consultants or
independent contractors and not as employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

  

##### (x) No deduction by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect
of any "applicable employee remuneration" (within the meaning of Section
162(m) of the Code) has been disallowed or is subject to disallowance by
reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

  

### (m) _No Excess Parachute Payments; Tax Gross-Ups._  No amount or other
entitlement or economic benefit that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of property) as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Shareholder Approval, the
consummation of the Merger or any other

     

   

### transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
termination of employment on or following the Effective Time) by or for the
benefit of any person who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) with respect to the Company
(each such person, a " _Company Disqualified Individual_ ") under any Company
Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or otherwise would be characterized
as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code).  Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth, calculated as of the date of this Agreement, (i) the "base
amount" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each
Company Disqualified Individual and (ii) the estimated maximum amount of
"parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) that could be

execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the Shareholder
Approval, the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of any termination of
employment on or following the Effective Time). No current or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is entitled to any gross-up, make-whole or other additional
payment from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any tax
(including Federal, state, local and foreign income, excise and other taxes
(including taxes imposed under sections 4999(a) or 409A of the Code))
or interest or penalty related thereto.

  

### (n) _Taxes._ (i) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each
Company Consolidated Group has filed, or has caused to be filed, in a timely
manner (within any applicable extension period) all material tax returns
required to be filed with any taxing authority pursuant to the Code or
applicable state, local or foreign tax laws.  All such tax returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects and have been prepared in
substantial compliance with all applicable Legal Provisions. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and each Company Consolidated Group has paid or
caused to be paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf) in a timely manner
all taxes due and owing, and the most recent financial statements contained
in the Filed Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve (determined in
accordance with GAAP) (excluding any reserves for deferred taxes established
to reflect temporary differences between book and tax income) for all taxes
payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and
portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial statements.

  

##### (ii) No tax return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
Company Consolidated Group is under audit or examination by any taxing
authority, and no notice or threat of such an audit or examination has been
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Consolidated Group. There is no deficiency, refund litigation, proposed
adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to any material amount of
taxes due and owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Consolidated Group. Each deficiency resulting from any completed audit or
examination relating to taxes by any taxing authority has been timely paid or
is being contested in good faith and has been reserved for on the books of
the Company. No issues relating to any material amount of taxes were raised
by the relevant taxing authority in any

     

   

##### completed audit or examination that could reasonably be expected
to recur in a later taxable period. There is no currently effective
agreement or other document extending, or having the effect of extending, the
period of assessment or collection of any taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Company Consolidated Group, nor has any request been made
for any such extension, and no power of attorney (other than powers of
attorney authorizing employees of the Company to act on behalf of
the Company) with respect to any taxes has been executed or filed with any
taxing authority.

to include in a taxable period ending after the Effective Time taxable income
attributable to income that accrued (for purposes of the financial statements
of the Company included in the Filed Company SEC Documents) in a prior
taxable period (or portion of a taxable period) but was not recognized for
tax purposes in any prior taxable period as a result of (A) the installment
method of accounting, (B) the completed contract method of accounting, (C)
the long-term contract method of accounting, (D) the cash method of
accounting or Section 481 of the Code or (E) any comparable provisions of

Code.

related trans­actions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) in
conjunction with the Merger.

  

##### (vi) The Company and its Subsidiaries have fully complied with all
applicable Legal Provisions relating to the payment and withholding of any

would, or that could reasonably be expected to, result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied.

  

### (c) _Advice of Changes; Filings._ The Company and Parent shall promptly
advise the other party orally and in writing of (i) any representation or
warranty made by it (and, in the case of Parent, made by Sub) contained in
this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality becoming untrue or
inaccurate in any respect or any such representation or warranty that is not
so qualified becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect or (ii)
the failure of it (and, in the case of Parent, of Sub) to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it (and, in the case of Parent, of Sub) under
this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall,
to the extent permitted by law, promptly provide the other with copies of all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with

### (d) _Certain Tax Matters._ (i) During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, (A) timely file all tax returns (" _Post-Signing
Returns_ ") required to be filed by or on behalf of each such entity; (B)
timely pay all taxes due and payable; (C) accrue a reserve in the books and
records and financial statements of any such entity in accordance with past
practice for all taxes payable by such entity for which no Post-Signing
Return is due prior to the Effective Time; (D) promptly notify Parent of any
suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit (collectively, "
_Actions_ ") that is or becomes pending against or with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any material amount of tax
and not settle or compromise any such Action without Parents consent; (E)
not make any material tax election or settle or compromise any material tax
liability, other than with Parents consent or other than in the ordinary
course of business; and (F) cause all existing tax sharing agreements, tax
indemnity obligations and similar agreements, arrangements or practices with
respect to taxes to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may be
a party or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may
otherwise be bound to be terminated as of the Closing Date so that after such
date neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any further
rights or liabilities thereunder. Any tax returns described in this Section
4.01(d) shall be complete and accurate in all material respects and shall be
prepared on a basis consistent with the past practice of the Company and in a
manner that does not distort taxable income ( _e.g._ , by deferring income or
accelerating deductions); _provided_ that no Post-Signing Returns shall be
filed with any taxing authority without Parents prior written consent.

   

40   

 

  

##### (ii) The Company shall deliver to Parent at or prior to the Closing a
certificate, in form and substance satisfactory to Parent, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying that the issuance (payment) of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is exempt from
withholding pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act.

  

##### (iii) Each of Parent, Sub and the Company and each of their respective
Affiliates shall not take any actions and shall not fail to take any action
which action or failure to act would prevent, or would be reasonably likely
to prevent, the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  

## SECTION 4.02. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant or other advisor, agent or representative (collectively,
" _Representatives_ ") retained by it or any of its Affiliates to, directly
or indirectly through another person, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage, or
take any other action designed to, or which could reasonably be expected to,
facilitate, any Takeover Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
person any information, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any Takeover
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section
4.02(a) by the Company.  The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any person conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal and request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished to such person(s).
 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to
obtaining the Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide
written Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith by a majority vote of the disinterested members
thereof (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, it being agreed that the financial advisor
may be Needham or PiperJaffray) constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal, and which Takeover Proposal was not solicited
after the date hereof and was made after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.02(a), the Company may, if
its Board of Directors determines in good faith by a majority vote of the
disinterested members thereof (after consultation with outside counsel) that
it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable law, and subject to compliance
with Section 4.02(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the person making such Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement (a copy of
which shall be provided to Parent) not less restrictive of such person than
the Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that all such information has
previously been provided to Parent or is provided to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrent with the time it is provided to such person, and (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover Proposal.

     

   

The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
revenues, net income or the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to
which any person or the shareholders of any person would own 15% or more of
any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
of any resulting parent company of the Company, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide offer made by a third
party that if consummated would result in such person (or its shareholders)
owning, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Company Common
Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger or the direct
or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or more than 50% of
the assets of the Company, which the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith by a majority vote of the disinterested members
thereof (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, it being understood that the financial
advisor may be Needham or PiperJaffray) to be (i) more favorable to the
shareholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger
(taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable
of being completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
other aspects of such proposal.

  

### (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of
Directors or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Takeover
Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend,
or propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal (other than
a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 4.02(a)) (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time
prior to obtaining the Shareholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company receives a Superior Proposal and as a result thereof determines

     

   

### in good faith by a majority vote of the disinterested members of the
Board of Directors (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, it being understood that the
financial advisor may be Needham or PiperJaffray) that it is required to do
so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the
Company under applicable law, the Company may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Adverse
Recommendation Change may be made until after the fourth business day
following Parents receipt of written notice (a " _Notice of Adverse
Recommendation_ ") from the Company advising Parent that the Board of
Directors of the Company intends to take such action and specifying
all material terms and conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action by the Board of Directors (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term
of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Adverse
Recommendation and a new four business day period). In determining whether
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall take into account any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to a Notice of
Adverse Recommendation or otherwise.

  

### In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a)
and (b) of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally
and in writing of any Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of
any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including any material changes
thereto) and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal or
inquiry.  The Company shall (i) keep Parent promptly and reasonably
informed of the status and details (including any material change to the
terms thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to
Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies
of all material correspondence and other written material sent or provided to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from any person that describes any of
the terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal.

  

### (c) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 shall prohibit the Company
from (x) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (y) making
any disclosure to the shareholders of the Company if, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors, as determined by a majority vote of the
disinterested members thereof (after consultation with outside counsel), the
failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations under
applicable law, including the Board of Directors duty of candor to the
shareholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company or its Board of Directors or any committee thereof take, or agree
or resolve to take, any action prohibited by Section 4.02(b).

# ** _Additional Agreements_**

  

## SECTION 5.01. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement;
Shareholders  Meeting._ (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of

## Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of the Company and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto and have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
the shareholders of the Company as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is not now so qualified or filing a general consent to service of process)
required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection
with the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement will be made by the Company,
in each case without providing the other party the opportunity to review and
comment thereon.  If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall supply each other
with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with
respect to the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or mailing the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or
the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, each party shall provide the other
party an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response.

  

### (b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Agreement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Shareholders Meeting solely for the purpose of obtaining the
Shareholder Approval. Subject to Sections 4.02(b) and 4.02(c), the Company
shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders adoption
of this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy
Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and in accordance
with Section 302A.613 of the MBCA, the Companys obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 5.01(b) shall not be affected by (i) the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the

     

   

### Company of any Takeover Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification
by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof of such
Board of Directors or such committees approval or recommendation of this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

### (c) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause to
be delivered to Parent a letter of Grant Thornton LLP and Ernst and Young LLP,
the Companys registered public accountants, dated a date within two business
days before the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective and
addressed to Parent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
and customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by registered
public accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Form S-4.

  

## SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ To the extent
permitted by applicable law, the Company shall afford to Parent, and to
Parents officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other Representatives, reasonable access (including for the purpose
of coordinating integration activities and transition planning with the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries) during normal business hours
and upon reasonable prior notice to the Company during the period prior to
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all its and its
Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts, personnel and records, including
for the purpose of conducting Phase I environmental site assessments and
compliance audits of the Companys properties and operations, and, during
such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state
securities laws, (b) a copy of each correspondence or written communication
with any United States Federal or state Governmental Entity and (c) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request. Except for disclosures expressly
permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of April 19,
2005, as amended from time to time, between Parent and the Company (as it may
be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), Parent
shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information
received from the Company, directly or indirectly, in confidence
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.  No investigation pursuant
to this Section 5.02 or information provided or received by any party hereto
pursuant to this Agreement will affect any of the representations or
warranties of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement or the
conditions hereunder to the obligations of the parties hereto. The Company
agrees that Parent may contact customers, vendors or other persons having
business relationships with the Company after consultation with the Company.

  

## SECTION 5.03. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts._ Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the
parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner
practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by

     

   

## this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following:  (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the
conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, consents, approvals and
waivers from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and
the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver
from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii)
the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third
parties and (iv) obtaining or transferring all Environmental Permits
necessary for operating the business of the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
applicable Environmental Law. In connection with and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall duly file the HSR Filing required
under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as practicable. The HSR Filing shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate
with the other party to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the
preparation of its HSR Filing, to request early termination of the waiting
period required by the HSR Act and, if requested, to promptly amend or
furnish additional information thereunder. The Company and its Board of
Directors shall (1) take all action necessary to ensure that no "control
share acquisitions", "business combinations", "fair price" (including
Sections 302A.671, .673 and .675 of the MBCA) or other state takeover laws or
other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any state takeover laws or other
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, the Company shall take the actions set forth on
Section 5.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent to agree to, or proffer to,
divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

  

## SECTION 5.04. _Company Stock Options._ (a) As soon as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company Stock
Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the following:

  

##### (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options granted
in connection with the performance of services for the Company to any person
who is an employee or officer on the Closing Date (the " _Employee Stock
Options_ "), whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that each
Employee Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, a " _Rolled-Over Option_ ") shall be converted into an option to
acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the
Rolled-Over Option, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down
to the nearest

     

   

##### whole share), determined by multiplying the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Rolled-Over Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time for which such Rolled-Over Option shall not theretofore
have been exercised by the Exchange Ratio at an exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock equal to (A) the per share exercise price for the shares
of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Rolled-Over
Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, an "
_Adjusted Option_ ");  _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded
up to the nearest whole cent; _provided further_ that any Rolled-Over Option
that is intended to be an "incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422
of the Code), and that may not be adjusted in the foregoing manner and remain
an incentive stock option, shall be adjusted in accordance with the
requirements of Section 424 of the Code in a manner that most closely
produces the economic results obtained with respect to other Adjusted Options
(it being understood that it is the intention of the parties that Rolled-Over
Options so assumed by Parent qualify, to the maximum extent permissible
following the Effective Time, as "incentive stock options" (as defined in
Section 422 of the Code), to the extent that such Rolled-Over Options
qualified as "incentive stock options" prior to the Effective Time);

  

##### (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding Company Stock Options that are
not Employee Stock Options (the " _Non-Employee Stock Options_ "), whether
vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that each Non-Employee Stock
Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
as of the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall then become entitled

coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on
the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may (i) substitute
therefor policies of Parent containing terms with respect to coverage

### vesting, benefit levels and accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plans); _provided_ ,  _however_ ,

the employment of any specific person.

to enter into this Agreement, by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 8.11.

  

## SECTION 8.12. _Severability._ If any term or other provision of

incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in
an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

EXHIBIT B 
 TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT

  

 _Form of Affiliate Letter_

  

Dear Sirs:

  

The undersigned, a holder of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (" _Company Common Stock_ "), of PEMSTAR INC., a Minnesota corporation
(the " _Company_ "), acknowledges that the undersigned may be deemed an
"affiliate" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 (" _Rule 145_")
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities
Act_ "), by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ "), although
nothing contained herein should be construed as an admission of such fact.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of October
16, 2006, among BENCHMARK ELECTRONICS, INC., a Texas corporation (" _Parent_
"), AUTOBAHN ACQUISITION CORP., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Sub_ "), and the Company, Sub will be merged with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), and in connection with the Merger,
the undersigned is entitled to receive shares of common stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ")

  

If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the Securities Act,
the undersigneds ability to sell, assign or transfer the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any shares of
Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger may be restricted unless
such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from
such registration is available. The undersigned understands that such
exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained or will obtain advice
of counsel as to the nature and conditions of such exemptions, including
information with respect to the applicability to the sale of such securities
of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under the Securities Act. The
undersigned understands that Parent will not be required to maintain the
effectiveness of any registration statement under the Securities Act for the
purposes of resale of shares of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned.

  

The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with Parent that the
undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for shares of Company
Common Stock in connection with the Merger except (i) pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii) in conformity
with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii) in a transaction
which, in the opinion of counsel to the undersigned, such counsel to be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and such opinion to be in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or as described in a "no-action"
or interpretive letter from the staff of the SEC specifically issued with
respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the undersigned, is not required
to be registered under the Securities Act.  

   

In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply
Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in
the form of Annex I hereto and the opinion of counsel or no-action letter
referred to above. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its
transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock
disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not
prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of
such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to
effectuate the transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock sold
as indicated in such letter.

  

Parent covenants that it will take all such actions as may be reasonably
available to it to permit the sale or other disposition of the shares of
Parent Common Stock by the undersigned under Rule 145 in accordance with the
terms thereof.

  

The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth below will
be placed on certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock
received by the undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a
transferee thereof, which legend will be removed by delivery of substitute
certificates upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Parent from counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the
effect that such legend is no longer required for purposes of the Securities
Act.

  

There will be placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to
the undersigned in connection with the Merger, or any substitutions therefor,
a legend stating in substance:

  

"The shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a
transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933
applies. The shares have not been acquired by the holder with a view to, or
for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933. The shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred except in accordance with an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

  

The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read
this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations
imposed upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement
to Parents obligations to consummate the Merger.

  

Very truly yours,
