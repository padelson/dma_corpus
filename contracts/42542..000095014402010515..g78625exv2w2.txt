                  transfer of TRW's interests in the Spanish Affiliate is not
                  obtained on or prior to October 1, 2002 (or such other date
                  as the parties shall select as the Closing Date), (ii) all
                  the conditions to closing in Article VII are satisfied or
                  waived at or prior to such time, and (iii) CASA has not
                  exercised its pre-emptive rights to purchase TRW's interests
                  in the Spanish Affiliate, pursuant to the terms and
                  conditions of the organizational documents governing the
                  Spanish Affiliate (such rights, the "Pre-Emptive Rights"),
                  then (x) the Closing shall take place on October 1, 2002 (or
                  such other date as the parties shall select as the Closing
                  Date), with a reduction of $3,000,000 (three million dollars)
                  to the Purchase Price (which shall be treated as a decrease
                  to the purchase price for all purposes of this Agreement),
                  and (y) the provisions of Section 6.5(b) will apply to the
                  treatment of TRW's interest in the Spanish Affiliate until
                  the earlier of such time as CASA provides its consent to the
                  transfer of TRW's interests in the Spanish Affiliate to Buyer
                  or CASA exercises its Pre-Emptive Rights. Following the

                  TRW's interests in the Spanish Affiliate to Buyer, TRW


                                       4
<PAGE>
                  shall transfer ownership of TRW's interests in the Spanish
                  Affiliate to Buyer immediately following receipt of such
                  consent, and Buyer shall pay to TRW an amount equal to
                  $3,000,000 (three million dollars) in immediately available
                  funds (which shall be treated as a increase to the purchase
                  price for all purposes of this Agreement), at which time the
                  provisions of Section 6.5(b) as they relate to the treatment
                  of TRW's interests in the Spanish Affiliate shall immediately
                  cease. Following the Closing Date, if CASA exercises its
                  Pre-Emptive Rights, then (i) upon transfer of TRW's interests
                  in the Spanish Affiliate to CASA pursuant to such exercise,
                  the provisions of Section 6.5(b) as they relate to the
                  treatment of TRW's interests in the Spanish Affiliate shall
                  immediately cease and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall use their
                  reasonable best efforts to cooperate and shall negotiate in
                  good faith to determine the value of TRW's interests in the
                  Spanish Affiliate (the "Spanish Affiliate Price"). Buyer and
                  TRW hereby expressly agree and acknowledge that the Spanish
                  Affiliate Price may be different from the amount paid by CASA
                  to TRW for the purchase of TRW's interests in the Spanish
                  Affiliate pursuant to the exercise of CASA's Pre-Emptive
                  Rights. If after ten (10) Business Days following the closing
                  of the transfer of TRW's interests in the Spanish Affiliate
                  to CASA, Buyer and TRW have not agreed on the Spanish
                  Affiliate Price, Buyer and TRW shall appoint a third-party
                  appraisal firm of international repute, reasonably mutually
                  acceptable to Buyer and TRW (the "Spanish Appraiser"), to
                  determine the Spanish Affiliate Price. The Spanish Appraiser
                  shall determine the Spanish Affiliate Price according to
                  commonly accepted valuation techniques and shall deliver its
                  report to Buyer and to TRW within twenty 20 Business Days of
                  its appointment. The Spanish Affiliate Price determined by
                  the Spanish Appraiser shall be final, non-appealable and
                  binding on both Buyer and TRW and may be enforced in any
                  court having competent jurisdiction. The fees and expenses of
                  the Spanish Appraiser shall be borne one-half by Buyer and
                  one-half by TRW. If the Spanish Affiliate Price is greater
                  than $3,000,000 (three million dollars), then TRW shall
                  deliver to Goodrich an amount in immediately available funds
                  equal to such excess (which shall be treated as a decrease to
                  the Purchase Price for all purposes of this Agreement). If
                  the Spanish Affiliate Price is less than $3,000,000 (three
                  million dollars), then Goodrich shall deliver to TRW an
                  amount in immediately available funds equal to such shortfall
                  (which shall be treated as an increase to the Purchase Price
                  for all purposes of this Agreement). The payment referred to
                  in the two preceding sentences shall be made no later than
                  two (2) Business Days after the later of (i) the date on
                  which TRW transfers its interests in the Spanish Affiliate


                                       5
<PAGE>
                  to CASA, (ii) the date on which Buyer and TRW mutually agree
                  the Spanish Affiliate Price or (iii) the date on which the
                  Spanish Appraiser delivers its report to Buyer and TRW. Buyer
                  shall control the process of agreeing with CASA on the
                  appropriate price to be paid pursuant to the exercise of
                  CASA's Pre-Emptive Rights, and TRW shall reasonably cooperate
                  with Buyer in its control of such process.

                  Section 1.5       TRW Thales Aerolec SAS (France). Section
6.5 of the Agreement shall hereby be amended to add the following clause (d) to
such section:

                           (d)      Buyer and TRW hereby agree that if (i) the
                  approval of the French Ministry of Finance to transfer TRW's
                  interests in TRW Thales Aerolec SAS (the "French JV") is not
                  obtained on or prior to October 1, 2002 (or such other date
                  as the parties shall select as the Closing Date), and (ii)
                  all the conditions to closing in Article VII are satisfied or
                  waived at or prior to such time, then (x) the Closing shall
                  take place on October 1, 2002 (or such other date as the
                  parties shall select as the Closing Date), with a reduction
                  of $30,000 (thirty thousand dollars) to the Purchase Price
                  (which shall be treated as a decrease to the Purchase Price
                  for all purposes of this Agreement), and (y) the provisions
                  of Section 6.5(b) will apply to the treatment of TRW's
                  interest in the French JV until the approval of the French
                  Ministry of Finance to transfer TRW's interests in the French
                  JV are obtained. As soon as reasonably practical following
                  receipt of the approval of the French Ministry of Finance to
                  transfer TRW's interests in the French JV, TRW shall transfer
                  such interests in the French JV to Buyer, and Buyer shall pay
                  to TRW an amount equal to $30,000 (thirty thousand dollars)
                  in immediately available funds, which shall be treated as an
                  increase in the Purchase Price for all purposes of this
                  Agreement, and upon such payment, the provisions of Section
                  6.5(b) as they relate to the treatment of TRW's interest in
                  the French JV shall immediately cease.

                  Section 1.6 Certain Consent Issues. Section 6.5 of the
Agreement shall hereby be amended to add the following clause (e) to such
section:

                           (e)      TRW and Buyer shall comply with the
                  procedures set forth in Exhibit D hereto in connection with
                  seeking the consent of Cincom Systems, Inc. to the transfer
                  of the Software License Agreement, dated July 31, 1997,
                  between Cincom Systems, Inc. and TRW Limited, to Buyer.

                  "(ii) At the Closing, or as soon as reasonably practicable
                  thereafter, TRW shall (A) pay the five Australian Transferred
                  Employees engaged in managerial or supervisory duties

                  leave of the Australian Transferred Employees as at Closing

                  (a)      Subsection 6.8(u)(i) of the Agreement shall hereby
be amended to add the following sentence at the end thereof:

                  For the purposes of calculating any Payment under this
                  Section 6.8(u), any on account transfer or excess payment
                  made under paragraph 11 of Schedule 6.8(e)(ii) to the
                  Agreement shall be ignored except that any on account
                  transfer (as adjusted in accordance with Schedule 6.8(e)(ii))
                  shall be deemed to form part of the Transfer Amount (or such
                  lesser amount as is actually transferred from the TRW Pension
                  Scheme to the Buyer UK Pension Scheme

<PAGE>
                  in discharge of the TRW Scheme's liability to provide benefits
                  for the UK Transferred Employees) when the Transfer Amount (or
                  such lesser amount) is actually transferred.

                  (b)      The "TRW Share Sale-Pension Schedule", attached as
Annex 1 to Schedule 6.8(e)(ii) to the Agreement, shall be amended to add the
following as paragraphs 10 and 11 to such TRW Share Sale-Pension Schedule:

                  "10      REDUNDANCIES

                  If on or before 31 December 2002 a Consenting Member is made
                  redundant by the Buyer's Group or in the case of a Consenting
                  Member who was a member of the "Senior Sections" in the TRW
                  Scheme, such a Consenting Member retires at the employer's
                  request and in either case is then aged 50 or over, TRW and
                  the Buyer will co-operate in good faith (Revenue requirements
                  permitting) to arrange for him to be offered the option of
                  transferring the value of the rights he has then accrued or
                  been credited under the Buyer's Scheme to the TRW Scheme, so
                  that the TRW Scheme will provide for him the benefits which
                  he would have received on redundancy or, in the case of a
                  Consenting Member of the "Senior Sections", on retirement at
                  the employer's request, had he remained in active membership
                  of the TRW Scheme after Closing until the date when he was
                  made redundant or, in the case of a Consenting Member of the
                  "Senior Sections", the date when such a Consenting Member
                  retired at the employer's request.

                  Any such transfer value will be calculated by the TRW Actuary
                  (and agreed by the Buyer's Actuary) in accordance with
                  paragraph 4 of this Schedule.

                  If Payment Date takes place after 31 December 2002, the
                  transfer value shall be an amount equal to the sum of (a) and
                  (b) (as defined below). There will be no physical transfer
                  payment from the Buyer's Scheme back to the TRW Scheme but
                  the transfer value will be made by netting off such amount
                  against the Transfer Amount which would otherwise be paid by
                  the TRW Scheme to the Buyer's Scheme under this Schedule (or
                  against such lesser amount as is transferred from the TRW
                  Scheme to the Buyer's Scheme in discharge of the TRW Scheme's
                  liability to provide benefits for the UK Transferred
                  Employees).

                  Where (a) is the part of the Transfer Amount in respect of
                  the member concerned that would have been transferred to the
                  Buyer's Scheme under this Schedule but for the provisions
                  contained in this paragraph (with the proviso that, if the
                  sum otherwise transferred on Payment Date from the TRW Scheme
                  to the Buyer's Scheme is lower than the Transfer Amount, a
                  reduction on that same basis is made to this item (a)); and

                  Where (b) is the value of the Consenting Member's benefits
                  that have accrued on or after Closing under the Buyer's
                  Scheme calculated on the date of termination of service on
                  the TRW PBO basis in accordance with the Actuary's Letter and
                  paragraph 4 (with references to Closing being to the date of
                  termination of service) and then increased or decreased over

                  ending on the end of the day which is 3 days before the
                  Payment Date by the Timing Adjustment and then increased by
                  interest at the Agreed Rate from (and including) the day
                  which is 2 days before the Payment Date to the end of the day
                  before the Payment Date. For the avoidance of doubt when
                  calculating the value of the member's benefits on the TRW PBO
                  basis, Factors A, B & C (as defined in the Actuary's Letter)
                  will not apply.

                  If Payment Date is on or before 31 December 2002, the
                  transfer value shall be an amount in cash equal to the sum of
                  (c) and (d) (as defined below).

                  Where (c) is the part of the unadjusted Transfer Amount (as
                  defined in the Actuary's Letter) in respect of the member
                  concerned as at Closing (with the proviso that, if the sum
                  transferred on Payment Date from the TRW Scheme to the
                  Buyer's Scheme is lower than the Transfer Amount, a reduction
                  on that same basis is made to this item (c)), and then
                  increased or decreased over the period starting on Closing
                  and ending on the end of the day which is 3 days before the
                  day of payment of this transfer value by the Timing
                  Adjustment and then increased by interest at the Agreed Rate
                  from (and including) the day which is 2 days before the day
                  of payment of this transfer value to the end of the day
                  before the day of payment of this transfer value; and

                  Where (d) is the value of the Consenting Member's benefits
                  that have accrued on or after Closing under the Buyer's
                  Scheme calculated on the date of termination of service on

                  to Closing being to the date of termination of service), and
                  then increased or decreased over the period starting on the
                  day of termination of service and ending on the end of the
                  day which is 3 days before the day of payment of this
                  transfer value by the Timing Adjustment and then increased by
                  interest at the Agreed Rate from (and including) the day
                  which is 2 days before the day of payment of this transfer
                  value to the end of the day before the day of payment of this
                  transfer value. For the avoidance of doubt when calculating
                  the value of the member's benefits on the TRW PBO basis,
                  Factors A, B & C (as defined in the Actuary's Letter) will
                  not apply.

                  If a member is reinstated in the TRW Scheme pursuant to this
                  paragraph 10 he will then cease to be treated as a Consenting
                  Member for all other purposes of this Schedule.

                  11       ON ACCOUNT TRANSFER

                  (A)      TRW will procure that, within 6 weeks after the end
                  of the Transfer Consent Period or, if later the date when at
                  least 90 per cent of the Option Forms have been received by
                  TRW, TRW's Actuary will estimate the Transfer Amount and
                  notify that estimate to the Buyer's Actuary.

                  (B)      TRW will use all reasonable endeavours to procure
                  that the TRW Scheme will transfer to the Buyer's Scheme on
                  such date as is agreed by TRW and the Buyer, as a payment on
                  account of the Transfer Amount, an amount equal to 50 per
                  cent. of the estimate so notified.

                  the payment made in accordance with this paragraph 11(B) and

                  Payment Date to the end of the day before the Payment Date.

                  the Buyer for any Tax Benefit received in the same manner and

                  Buyer's Scheme) will procure that the transferring scheme
                  will before the transfer deliver to the receiving scheme a
                  letter of direction supporting the use of Transaction Stamp

                  (E)      If a payment on account is made, Appendix B to the
                  Schedule will be modified to reflect the provisions of this
