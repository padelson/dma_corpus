the Target Financial Statements, or where the failure to own good and marketable title is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, the Target Companies have good and marketable title, free and clear of all Liens, to all of
their respective Assets. All Material tangible properties used in the businesses of the Target Companies are in good condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are usable in the ordinary course of business consistent with Target&#146;s past
practices. All Assets which are Material to Target&#146;s business on a consolidated basis, held under leases or subleases by any of the Target Companies are held under valid Contracts enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors&#146; rights generally and except that the availability of the equitable remedy of specific
performance or injunctive relief is subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought), and each such Contract is in full force and effect. The policies of fire, theft, liability and other insurance maintained with
respect to the Assets or businesses of the Target Companies provide adequate coverage under current industry practices against loss or Liability, and the fidelity and blanket bonds in effect as to which any of the Target Companies is a named insured
are, in the reasonable belief of Target&#146;s management, reasonably sufficient. No Target Company has received notice from any insurance carrier than (i) such insurance will be cancelled or that coverage thereunder will be reduced or eliminated or
(ii) premium costs with respect to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. The Assets of the Target Companies include all assets required to operate the business of the Target Companies as presently conducted. </FONT></P> <P
