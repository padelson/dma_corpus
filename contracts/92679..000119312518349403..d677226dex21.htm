EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

 

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:

(a)  _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $1.25 per
share, of the Company (including any Restricted Shares that fully vest
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(a)_) (each, a " _Share_ ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than (i) the
Cancelled Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.01(b)_, and (ii) the Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated
in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_, shall be converted into the right
to receive $18.50 per Share in cash, without interest thereon (the " _Per
Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Shares shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
such Share, whether represented by a certificate (" _Certificate_ ") or in
non-certificated form and represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_
"), shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_.

 



-3- 

    

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Share that immediately prior to
the Effective Time is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other wholly owned
Subsidiary of Parent and each Share that immediately prior to the Effective
Time is owned by the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
(including as treasury stock) (collectively, the " _Cancelled Shares_ ")
shall at such time automatically cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without
payment of any consideration therefor and cease to exist.

 

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each common share, no par value, of Merger
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
common share, no par value, of the Surviving Corporation, and all such shares
when so converted shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.02. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. With respect to each Share that is
subject to any vesting, forfeiture, repurchase or other lapse restriction
under any Company Equity Award Plan (each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, such vesting,
forfeiture, repurchase or other lapse restriction shall lapse as of the
Effective Time and such Restricted Share shall be fully vested and shall be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_.

 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award in respect of Shares granted under a Company
Equity Award Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(a " _Company_ _RSU_ ") shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted
automatically into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable
(but no later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, from or
on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each Share
underlying such Company RSU.

(c) _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each option award
in respect of Shares granted under a Company Equity Award Plan that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Option_ "),
whether vested or unvested, and has an exercise price per Share that is less
than the Per Share Merger Consideration shall fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but no later than five (5) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, from or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (i) the amount by which the
Per Share Merger Consideration exceeds the exercise price

 



-4- 

    

 per Share of such Company Option and (ii) the total number of Shares subject
to such Company Option. At the Effective Time, each Company Option that has an
exercise price per Share that is greater than or equal to the Per Share
Merger Consideration shall cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and cease to
exist and the holder of any such Company Option shall not be entitled to
payment of any consideration therefor. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no outstanding Company Options.

(d) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Sections 2.02(a)_ through
_2.02(c)_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital
stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Restricted
Shares, Company RSUs, Company Options or any other awards under any Company
Equity Award Plan.

 

(e) _Funding_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall make a cash contribution to the Surviving Corporation in immediately
available funds to permit the Surviving Corporation to make or cause to be
made the payments required under _Sections 2.02(b)_ and _2.02(c)_ to the
extent, if any, the Surviving Corporation does not otherwise have sufficient
funds to make such payments.

Section 2.03. _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") that is reasonably acceptable to the Company
and enter into an agreement with such Paying Agent (the " _Paying Agent
Agreement_ ") in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company
wherein the Paying Agent will act as agent for the Company Shareholders in
connection with the Merger and receive payment of the aggregate Per Share
Merger Consideration to which the Company Shareholders shall become entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in trust
for the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately
available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments required pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)_ upon due surrender of Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_
(such cash amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").
The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Financial Services LLC, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of acquisition or a combination of the

 



-5- 

    

 foregoing and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity
exceeding three (3) months. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.03(c)_, to the extent
that there are losses with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund
diminishes for other reasons below the level required to satisfy Parents
remaining obligations to make prompt cash payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash
in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to
ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all applicable times maintained at a
level sufficient to make such payments. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and
any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_
shall be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
requested by Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_ shall not be used for any purpose other than as
contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.03(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and, in any
event, within four (4) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each Person who was, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares (other
than holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) (A) transmittal
materials, including a letter of transmittal, specifying that delivery of
Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title with respect to Shares
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent, such transmittal
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent.

(ii)  _Payment of Per Share Merger Consideration_. Upon surrender of
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Paying Agent together with the transmittal materials, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions or by
the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive, and Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver promptly after the Effective
Time, a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the product of (A)
the number of Shares represented by such holders properly surrendered
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) and Book-Entry Shares and
(B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and any
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares.

 



-6- 

    

(iii) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to be made to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, a check or wire transfer for any cash to be exchanged upon due
surrender of the Certificate may, in the reasonable discretion of the Paying
Agent, be issued to such transferee or other Person if the Certificate
formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid
or, to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent, are not applicable. For the
avoidance of doubt, payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered.

 

(iv) _Rights of Holders of Shares; Expenses_. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)_, each Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender (together with the transmittal materials, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required pursuant to such instructions or by
the Paying Agent) the Per Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, except for (A) Dissenting Shares, which shall be
deemed to represent the right to receive the consideration due with respect to
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_ and to the
extent provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and (B) Cancelled Shares.
Parent shall pay or cause to be paid all charges and expenses of the Paying
Agent set forth in the Paying Agent Agreement.

 

(c) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand by Parent. Any holders of Shares (other
than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied
with this _ARTICLE II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look only to Parent and
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration
upon surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.03(b)_, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable
for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law)
payment of their claims for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon
due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, the

 



-7- 

    

 Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any Person
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law. If any Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the
related Per Share Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Per Share Merger Consideration shall, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become
the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, acceptable evidence
of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share
(other than a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Share in respect of Dissenting Shares) is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, the holder of such
Shares shall be given a copy of the transmittal materials referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)(i)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions
thereto in order to receive the cash amount to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_.

(e) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, the posting by
such Person of a bond in a reasonable amount as the Paying Agent, Surviving
Corporation or Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate and (ii) delivery of the
other materials provided for in _Section_ __ _ 2.03(b)(ii)_, the Paying
Agent shall pay and deliver promptly after the Effective Time in exchange for
such Certificate a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the
product of (A) the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate and (B) the Per Share Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon.

 

Section 2.04. _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, Restricted Shares, Company RSUs or
Company Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
state, local or foreign Tax Law, taking into account any applicable exemption
under such Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Paying
Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (a) shall be promptly remitted by the Paying Agent, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity
and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made
by the Paying Agent, Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be. For

 Company as United States real property interests, for purposes of Sections
897 and 1445 of the Code if the Company fails to deliver to Parent at the
Closing a certification issued in accordance with the procedures of Section
897 and 1445 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ , to the effect that interests in the Company
are not United States real property interests and that, throughout the period
described in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii)(II) of the Code, the Company has not
been a United States real property holding corporation (as defined in Section
897 of the Code).

 

Section 2.05. _Dissenters_ __ _Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares that are held by any record holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands payment of the fair cash value of such
Shares as a dissenting shareholder pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, the provisions of Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_,
but instead at the Effective Time shall become entitled to receive the fair
cash value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and, at the Effective Time, all such Dissenting
Shares shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and cease to exist, and the holder of such Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except as set forth in this _Section_ __
_ 2.05_ and the OGCL. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if
any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the
right to proceed under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair cash value of such holders Dissenting Shares under Section
1701.85 of the OGCL shall be forfeited and cease, and each of such holders
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective
Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for the fair cash value of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments delivered to the Company pursuant to the
OGCL with respect to a demand for the fair cash value of the Shares, and shall
provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to any demands under Section 1701.85 of the OGCL.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer
to settle, any such demands, or agree to take any such action.

Section 2.06. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the number
of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares issued and outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time shall have been changed into a different number of Shares or securities
or a different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split
(including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar
transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to provide the holders thereof the same economic effect
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such change; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ shall be construed to permit the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other Person to take any action
that is otherwise prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(i) The Company has timely filed or furnished, as applicable, all SEC Reports,
including all schedules, forms, statements and other documents, required to
be filed or furnished by it with the SEC since September 1, 2016 (such SEC
Reports, the " _Applicable SEC Reports_ "). As of their respective effective
dates (in the case of Applicable SEC Reports that are registration statements

respective dates of filing (in the case of all other Applicable SEC Reports)
or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the date of

liabilities, revenues or expenses in any material respect, or that have
identified any "significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as

operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably
likely to adversely affect in any material respect the Companys ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information.

relationship between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and any other Person, including any structured finance, special
purpose, or limited purpose Person, on the other hand); or (B) any "off

circumstances, or developments (changes, effects, events, occurrences, state
of circumstances, and developments being collectively referred to as "

by this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of

Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1 (the " _DOJ Investigation_ "), and directing the
Company to preserve documents and information relating to the DOJ
Investigation. In response to the DOJ Letter, in March 2018, the Company and
the DOJ agreed on the identities of the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that would be subject to the document preservation requirements
in the DOJ Letter. The Company implemented a document preservation plan
consistent with such agreement with the DOJ. Since the date of the DOJ Letter,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have complied with the document preservation
requirements of the DOJ Letter, as such requirements were subsequently
modified by the Companys agreement with the DOJ. Prior to the date hereof,
the Company was informed by the DOJ that the DOJ Investigation is focused on
the future activities of ERAPSCO, the Company and Ultra Electronics Holdings
plc (" _Ultra_ ") as each of the parties to ERAPSCO enhances its ability to
independently develop, produce and sell sonobuoys and over time such parties
work toward the elimination of their use of ERAPSCO for such activities. Prior
to the date of this Agreement, the Company made available to Parent a true and
complete copy of all written communications sent or received since the date
of the DOJ Letter and prior to the date of this Agreement between the DOJ, on
one hand, and the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
advisors, on the other hand, relating to or in connection with the DOJ
Investigation, which written communications are described in Section
3.01(h)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Since the date of the DOJ Letter
and prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective advisors has had any oral
communications with the DOJ relating to or in connection with the DOJ
Investigation that materially alter the representations made in this _Section_
__ _ 3.01(h)(ii)_.

Material Contract or the existence of any event or condition which constitutes
or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a default or

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or would not
otherwise prevent or materially adversely affect the Companys ability to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement. Since September 1, 2016,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has (A) received any written
notice from any Governmental Entity regarding any violation of, or failure to

Entity regarding any violation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
any Law, except, in each case, where such non-compliance or violation has not

obligations under this Agreement. All Permits are valid and in full force and
effect and are not subject to any administrative or judicial Proceeding or
investigation that would reasonably be expected to result in modification,

not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or would not otherwise prevent or
materially adversely affect the Companys ability to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement. The Company is, and each of its Subsidiaries
is, (A) in compliance with the terms and requirements of such Permits, and
(B) has not made any untrue statement or failed to disclose a fact required to
be disclosed to any Governmental Entity in connection with any application
for, or reporting required pursuant to, any Permit, except, in the case of
the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), where such non-compliance, untrue statement
or failure to disclose has

 



-23-

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or would not otherwise prevent or
materially adversely affect the Companys ability to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Since September 1, 2016, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any Permit will be

suspension of the marketing or distribution (including for commercial,

application to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any similar Law.
During the three (3) years prior to the date of this Agreement, each Person
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was or is properly
classified as exempt or non-exempt in accordance with applicable overtime

Company or any of its Subsidiaries should have been properly classified as an

(l) _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 

(i) Section 3.01(l)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
and accurate list of each Company Benefit Plan in effect as of the date of
this Agreement. True and complete copies (or summaries for any Company Benefit

made available to Parent, and the Company has made available to Parent where
applicable (A) the most recently prepared actuarial report or financial
statement, (B) the most recent summary plan description, and all material
modifications thereto, (C) the most recent annual report (Form 5500 Series)
and accompanying schedule, (D) the most recent determination letter or opinion
letter, (E) copies of any material written correspondence with a Governmental

-25- 

    

 documents delivered or made available to Parent, there are no amendments to
any Company Benefit Plan that have been adopted or approved nor have the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or
to adopt or approve any new Company Benefit Plan.

(ii) (A) Each Company Benefit Plan (and any related trust or other funding
vehicle) has been in all material respects established, operated and
administered in accordance with its terms and is in compliance with ERISA, the
Code and all other applicable Law, (B) all contributions or other amounts
payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan in respect of current or prior plan years have been paid or
accrued in accordance with GAAP, the Code, the terms of such plans and
other applicable Laws, (C) each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is in
compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code and all other Laws,
in each case, applicable to Company Benefit Plans and (D) each Company Benefit
Plan (and any related trust) that is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter,
or has pending or has time remaining in which to file an application for such
determination or opinion from the IRS and there are no facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.

individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (A) no
Proceedings (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course of
business) are pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened relating
to or otherwise in connection with any Company Benefit Plan or the assets
thereof and (B) there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened material administrative investigations, audits or other

Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Sections 412 or 4971 of the Code, or is
otherwise a defined benefit plan (as defined in Section 4001 of ERISA). The
fair market value of assets available for benefits under each Company Benefit
Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA exceeds the present value of
accumulated benefit obligations under such Company Benefit Plan, and

 



-26- 

    

 also, on a plan termination basis, exceeds the value of "benefit
liabilities" under such Company Benefit Plan within the meaning of Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA, and the actuarial valuation of each such Company
Benefit Plan for the most recent plan year accurately reflects its actuarial
condition as of the first day of such plan year, and there has been no

(vi) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of
the Company Requisite Vote or the consummation of the Merger (alone or in
conjunction with any other event, including any termination of employment on
or following the Effective Time) would reasonably be expected to (A) entitle
any current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any compensation or material
benefit, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or trigger any payment
or funding, of any compensation or material benefits or trigger any
other material obligation under any Company Benefit Plan, (C) result in any
material breach or violation of, or material default under, or limit the
Companys right to amend, modify, terminate or transfer the assets of, any

Subsidiaries as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
obtaining of the Company Requisite Vote or the consummation of the Merger (in
each case, alone, or in combination with any other event, whether or not
such other event could reasonably be expected to occur) to any of their
respective employees, officers, directors or independent contractors, or
otherwise, could not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
may be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. There is no
agreement, plan or other arrangement to which the Company or any of its

compensate any Person in respect of Taxes imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of
the Code.

agreement, plan or other arrangement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is otherwise bound to
compensate any Person in respect of Taxes imposed pursuant to Section 409A of
the Code.

(ix) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any other Person has engaged in a transaction in connection with
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably be expected to
be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 409 or
502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975 or 4976 of the Code.

(x) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, (A) each Company
Benefit Plan which is for the benefit of any employee or former employee,

Subsidiaries who is located outside or whose principal place of work is
outside the United States but excluding any employee benefit plan that is
statutorily required, government sponsored or not otherwise sponsored,

the assets held in connection with such plan in any material respect.

 



-28- 

    

(m) _Taxes_.

 

(i) (A) All material Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed (taking into

Returns are correct and complete in all material respects, (B) all Taxes of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown on any Tax Return)

bound to, or has any obligation under any Tax allocation or sharing agreement

a lease or a loan or to which the only parties are the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), (B) has been a

 



-29-

Affiliates or as a result of the identity of the Company or any of
its Affiliates and (VII) such other consents, approvals, orders, waivers,
permits, actions, authorizations, registrations, declarations, filings and
notices, the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(c) _Disclosure Documents_. All of the information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries supplied in writing by, or on behalf of, Parent, its
Subsidiaries or its Affiliates to the Company expressly for inclusion in, or
incorporation by reference into, the Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, in each case in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, at the time the Proxy
Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto are first mailed to the
Company Shareholders and at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

(d) _Litigation_. Except as has not prevented, materially delayed or impaired,
and would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair,
the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (i) there is no Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against, or pending or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, threatened material governmental or regulatory
investigation of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) there is no
injunction, order, judgment, ruling, decree or writ of any Governmental
Entity outstanding or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent

advisor or other Person, is entitled to, or will be entitled to, any brokers,
finders or financial advisors fee or commission or similar payments from
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which the Company could have
any liability.

(f) _Ownership and Operation of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists solely of 1,000 common shares, no par value, 1,000 of
which are validly issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub is, and at and immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent. Merger Sub has been
formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time will have engaged in no other
business activities and will have no assets, liabilities or obligations of
any nature other than those incident to its formation pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(g) _Ownership of Shares and Derivatives_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their Subsidiaries beneficially owns (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Exchange Act) any Shares or any securities that are convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Shares, or holds any rights to acquire or vote
any Shares, or any option, warrant, convertible security, stock appreciation
right, swap agreement or other security, contract right or derivative
position, whether or not presently exercisable, that provides Parent, Merger
Sub, or any of their respective Subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion
privilege or a settlement payment or mechanism at a price related to the value
of the Shares or a value determined in whole or part with reference to, or
derived in whole or part from, the value of the Shares, in any case without
regard to whether (i) such derivative conveys any voting rights in such
securities to such Person, (ii) such derivative is required to be, or capable
of being, settled through delivery of securities or (iii) such Person
may have entered into other transactions that hedge the economic effect of
such derivative. None of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries has
beneficially owned during the three (3) years immediately preceding the date
of this Agreement a number of Shares that would make it an "interested
shareholder" (as such term is defined in Section 1704.01(C) of the OGCL) of
the Company.

 

(h) _Financing_. As of the date hereof, Parent has delivered to the Company a
true and complete copy of the executed Equity Commitment Letter pursuant to
which the Guarantor and the other parties thereto have committed, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, to invest the Equity Financing. The Equity
Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect, has
not been terminated or otherwise amended or modified, and the commitments
contained in the Equity Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded, in each case in any respect. The Equity Commitment
Letter constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and the
Guarantor and the other parties thereto, is in full force and effect and is
enforceable against Parent, the Guarantor and the other parties thereto in
accordance with its terms. No event has occurred which, with or without
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under or breach on
the part of Parent, the Guarantor or any other party thereto under the Equity
Commitment Letter and, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, Parent has no reason
to expect that any of the conditions to the Equity Financing contemplated by
the Equity Commitment Letter applicable to Parent or Merger Sub will not be
satisfied on the Closing Date. The Equity Financing, when

 



-55- 

    

 funded in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment
Letter, will provide Parent with funds sufficient to satisfy, or cause to be
satisfied, all of Parents, Merger Subs and the Surviving Corporations
obligations under this Agreement (including all amounts required to be paid
pursuant to _ARTICLE II_ ), repay or refinance the Indebtedness of the Company
and its Subsidiaries required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and pay all fees and expenses of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The obligations to make the
Equity Financing available to Parent pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter are not subject to (i) any conditions precedent other than
as set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter or (ii) any contingencies
that would permit the Guarantor or any other party thereto to reduce the
amount of the Equity Financing, other than as set forth in the Equity
Commitment Letter. Each of Parent and Merger Sub affirms that it is not a
condition to the Closing or any of its other obligations under this Agreement
that Parent or Merger Sub obtain the Equity Financing, the Debt Financing or
any other financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 

(i) _Voting Requirements_. No vote of the holders of any class of capital
stock of Parent is necessary for Parent to approve this Agreement and approve
and consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

(j) _Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent has
delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the Limited Guarantee,
dated as of the date of this Agreement, which has been duly executed and
delivered by the Guarantor. The Limited Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Guarantor, is in full force and effect and is
enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms. As of the date
hereof, there is no default or breach under the Limited Guarantee by the
Guarantor and no event has occurred, which, with or without notice, lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default or breach under the Limited
Guarantee by the Guarantor.

(k) _Solvency_. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Financing, and payment of all fees and expenses of,
and any other amounts payable by, Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the
Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of and immediately after the
Effective Time. Parent is not entering into the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

(l) _Access to Information_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has conducted its
own independent investigation and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, condition and prospects of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and it and its Representatives have received
access to such books, records and facilities, equipment, Contracts and other
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries that it and its Representatives
have requested for such purposes and that

 



-56- 

    

 it and its Representatives have had the opportunity to meet with management
of the Company to discuss the foregoing, and it and its Representatives have
not relied on any representation, warranty, or any other statement by any
Person on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.01_.

 

(m) _Sanctions_. To the Knowledge of Parent, no director, officer or employee
of Parent or Merger Sub is identified on any of the following: (i) the OFAC
list of SDNs; (ii) the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States
Department of Commerce "Denied Persons List," "Entity List" or "Unverified
List"; (iii) the Office of Defense Trade Controls of the United States
Department of State "List of Debarred Parties," including both administrative
and statutory debarments; or (iv) the Bureau of International Security and
Nonproliferation of the United States Department of State listing of
"Nonproliferation Sanctions".

(n) _ITAR and NISPOM Matters_. 

(i) Parent and Merger Sub, and all of Parents Affiliates which would have
direct or indirect ownership or control of the Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time, are organized under the Laws of the United States. None of
Parent, Merger Sub or any of Parents Subsidiaries or Affiliates is registered
for any purpose under the provisions of the ITAR, including 22 CFR parts 122
or 129. The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of
this Agreement dos not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and compliance with
the provisions of this Agreement will not, result in ownership or control of
the Company by or on behalf of one or more foreign persons within the meaning
of the ITAR, including 22 CFR §§ 120.16 and 120.37.

 

(ii) Neither Parent nor Merger Sub intends, nor, to the Knowledge of Parent,
do any of Parents Affiliates intend, to cause or permit any direct or
indirect transfer of any of the articles, software, or technology (including
technical data) of the Company, its Subsidiaries or ERAPSCO to any foreign
Person, whether located in the United States or elsewhere, which transfer
would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of the ITAR or the EAR.

(iii) None of Parent or its Affiliates is or could reasonably be considered
to be under foreign ownership, control, or influence under the NISPOM ("
_FOCI_ "). After the Effective Time, no "foreign interest" (as defined in the
NISPOM) will have the direct or indirect power, whether or not exercised and
whether or not exercisable through the direct or indirect ownership of
Parents or any of its Affiliates securities, through contractual
arrangements or otherwise, to direct or decide matters affecting the
management or operations of Parent or any of its Affiliates in a manner which
may result in unauthorized access to

 



-57- 

    

 classified information or may adversely affect the performance of classified
Contracts. Parent does not have any Knowledge of any information that could
reasonably be expected to result in DSS (or any other Governmental Entity)
preventing, or materially impairing or delaying, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a result of FOCI-related issues
concerning Parent or any of its Affiliates.

 

(o) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in  _Section_ __ _ 3.01_, each of Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledges that neither the Company nor any other Person on behalf of
the Company makes any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries or ERAPSCO or with respect to any
other information provided to Parent or Merger Sub, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to Parent
or Merger Sub or their Representatives in any virtual data room maintained by
or on behalf of the Company or any confidential information package or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including with respect to the completeness, accuracy or
currency of any such information.

Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __ _
4.02_, and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation

agree or resolve to take actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A)
through (D) (any of the actions set forth in the foregoing clauses (A) through
(E), a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 4.02(d)(_ _i_ _)_ , at any time prior to
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, in the event that the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives receives from any
Person, after the date of this Agreement, an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written

Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to take such action would continue to be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 4.02(d)(i_), other than in connection

effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to taking any such action, (A) the Company shall provide Parent with at
least four (4) Business Days prior written notice of the Company Boards

Change would continue to be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

Employees eligibility to participate and vesting in such plan (but not for
accrual of benefits other than determining the level of vacation pay accrual);
_provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be considered to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits

extent employees become covered under any benefit plan of Parent or its

Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, for any employee who becomes covered
under a group health plan of Parent or its Affiliates, recognize the dollar
amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each

Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_, and no

Persons. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a guarantee
of continued employment of any Company Employee, (ii) to limit the right of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any Company
Employee or require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries to provide any such employee compensation or benefits for
any period following any such termination, (iii) to prevent the amendment,
modification or termination of any Company Benefit Plan after the Closing (in
each case in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit
Plan) or (iv) as an amendment or modification of the terms of any Company
Benefit Plan.

 

Section 5.07. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,

Section 5.08. _Indemnification; Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_Insurance_.

(a) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless the Persons listed on Section 5.08(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and each present and former director and officer of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity)
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law from and against any and all costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages and
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding arising out of or
pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
relating to the Indemnified Partys service with, at the request of or for the
benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, advance expenses to any
Indemnified Party claiming indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.08_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such Indemnified Party provides a written
undertaking in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor the provisions, to the extent they are enforceable under
applicable Law, regarding (i) exculpation of directors, (ii) limitation of
liability of directors and officers and (iii) advancement of expenses, in each
case, contained in the Company Articles of Incorporation, Company Code of
Regulations, the comparable organizational documents of any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or any indemnification Contract between the applicable
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to maintain for a period of at least six (6) years following the
Effective Time directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO_ _Insurance_ ") from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with benefits, levels of coverage and terms and
conditions that are at least as favorable as the Companys DandO Insurance
existing immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including for acts or
omissions in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend
for any year of such DandO Insurance coverage an annual premium amount greater
than three hundred percent (300%) of the annual premium paid by the Company
for DandO Insurance for the fiscal year immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "). The Company represents and
warrants that the annual premium paid by the Company for DandO Insurance for
the fiscal year immediately prior to the Effective Time is set forth in
Section 5.08(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the annual premiums of
such DandO Insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for an annual premium not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium.

(d) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_, the Company may in its sole
discretion obtain, prior to the Effective Time, six (6) year pre-paid "tail"
insurance coverage, at an aggregate cost no greater than six (6) times the
Maximum Annual Premium, providing for DandO Insurance not less favorable than
that described in _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_. If the Company has obtained such
policy pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.08(d)_, Parent will cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect for its full term and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation,
and Parent will have no further obligation to purchase or pay for insurance
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 5.08(c)_.

(e) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates or merges with or into any other Person and is not the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provisions to
be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume and comply with all of the obligations set forth in this  _Section_ __
_ 5.08_.

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation in this _Section_ __ _
5.08_ will not be terminated or modified in any manner which could adversely
affect any Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party.

(g) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section_ __ _ 5.08_
shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights such Indemnified
Parties may have under the Company Articles of Incorporation, the Company Code
of Regulations or any of the comparable organizational documents of any of
the Companys Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Law.

resignation of any such director or officer if Parent will have the power,
directly or indirectly, to remove any such Person from his or her position as
a director or officer without cause immediately after the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.15. _Transaction Litigation_. The Company and Parent shall promptly
notify each other of, and shall give each other the opportunity to

Section 8.11. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary

this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, each party hereto shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.01_, it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance

Sub to enforce the obligations under the Limited Guarantee to the extent
reasonably necessary to fund costs and expenses of Parent and/or Merger Sub
incurred and payable prior to Closing, which shall not be limited by this 
_Section_ __ _ 8.11_) shall be subject to the requirements that (x) all the
conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ have been
satisfied (and continue to be satisfied) or validly waived (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing; _provided_
, _however_ , that such conditions are capable of being satisfied at the
Closing) at the time when the Closing would have occurred (not taking into
account the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded) or been required to
occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.02_ and (y) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that it stands ready and willing to effect the Closing if specific
performance is granted and the Equity Financing is funded. Until such time as
this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.01_
and Parent pays or causes to be paid the Parent Termination Fee payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.04_ (and any amounts owed pursuant to

 



-98- 

    

  _Section_ __ _ 7.05_ and the penultimate sentence of _Section_ __ _
5.19(b)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from its right
to obtain specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies
subject to the limitations in this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ to the contrary, although the Company
may pursue both a grant of specific performance and payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive: (i) both (A) a grant of specific performance to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment
Letter (whether in connection with enforcing Parents obligation under this
Agreement to obtain the Equity Financing or enforcing Parents right to cause
the Equity Financing to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Equity
Commitment Letter) and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby to occur or other equitable relief compelling the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, on the one hand, and (B) payment of any
monetary damages whatsoever and/or the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
and any amounts owed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.05_, on the other hand; or
(ii) both (A) payment of any monetary damages whatsoever, on the one hand,
and (B) payment of the Parent Termination Fee and any amounts owed pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.05_, on the other hand.

 

(c) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (i) submits itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Cleveland, Ohio and

arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions

Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement hereof
and thereof, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such

_Section_ __ _ 8.11_ shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manger permitted by Law. Each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons,
notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.04_ shall be effective service of process for any
Proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason other
than the failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
8.11_, that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any
such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, that the Proceeding in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Proceeding is
improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof or thereof, may
not be enforced in or by such

 



-99- 

    

 courts and further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay
the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any party is
entitled pursuant to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each
party hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to
be irrevocable under the Law of the State of Ohio and of the United States of
America; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such partys consent to
jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ is solely for
the purpose referred to in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.11_ and shall not be
deemed to be a general submission to said courts or in the State of Ohio other
than for such purpose. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_
to the contrary, each of the parties agrees (A) that any claim, cross-claim,
suit, action or proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, to which any of the Debt
Financing Related Parties are party arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by the Debt Financing or the performance of services
thereunder shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
principles or rules or conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules
would require or permit the application of Laws of another jurisdiction and
shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of a state or federal court
sitting in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York and the
appellate courts thereof, (B) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates
to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such claim, suit, action or
proceeding in any other courts, other than a state or federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York and (C) to waive and
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which
any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any
such court.

 

Section 8.12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO

AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF OR THEREOF (INCLUDING ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING AGAINST OR INVOLVING ANY
DEBT FINANCING RELATED PARTY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT
UNDERSTANDS

 



-100- 

    

 AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG
OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.12_.

Section 8.13. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner
adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Section 8.15. _Disclosure Letters_. Certain items and matters are listed in
the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter for
informational purposes only and may not be required to be listed therein by
the terms of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter and the information and disclosures contained therein are
intended to qualify the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement. Inclusion
of any item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
(a) shall not be construed as an admission or indication that such item or
matter is material or would constitute a Material Adverse Effect, (b) shall
not be deemed to establish a standard for materiality or Material Adverse
Effect and (c) does not represent an admission or determination by the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub that such item did not arise in the ordinary
course of business or in a manner inconsistent with past practice. Where a
representation or warranty in this Agreement is qualified by a reference to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect, in no event shall the disclosure of
any matter in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter
imply that any other undisclosed matter that has a greater value or could
otherwise be deemed more significant (i) is or is reasonably likely to be
material or (ii) has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Without limiting the foregoing, no reference to, or
disclosure of, a possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law in the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be construed
as an admission or indication that a breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. Disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter shall also be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other Section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
information is relevant to such other Sections or subsections. The information
in the Company Disclosure Letter is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. In disclosing the information set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, expressly does not waive any
attorney-client privilege associated with such information or any protection
afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters
disclosed or discussed in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter, as applicable.

otherwise arise as a result of any actions, undertakings, agreements or
omissions of Deleon acting in its capacity as a general partner of ERAPSCO and

ARTICLE II

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

SECTION 2.1. _Annual Meeting_ _._ An annual meeting of the shareholders shall
be held on such date as may be determined by resolution of the board of
directors of the Corporation (the " _Board of Directors_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if in any year such date is a legal holiday, such meeting
shall be held on the next succeeding business day. At each annual meeting,
the shareholders shall elect directors to hold office for the term provided in
_Section_ __ _ 3.1_ of this Code of Regulations.

 

SECTION 2.2. _Special Meeting_ _._ A special meeting of the shareholders may
be called by the Board of Directors or by such officers or persons as the
Board of Directors may designate.

SECTION 2.3. _Place of Shareholder Meetings_ _._ The Board of Directors
may designate any place, either within or without the State of Ohio, as the
place of meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting. If no such
place is designated by the Board of Directors, the place of meeting will be
the principal business office of the Corporation.

SECTION 2.4. _Notice of Meeting_ _._ Unless waived as herein provided,
whenever shareholders are required or permitted to take any action at a
meeting, written notice of the meeting shall be given stating the place, date
and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or
purposes for which the meeting is called. Such written notice shall be given
not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of
the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting or in the
event of a merger, consolidation, share exchange, dissolution or sale, lease
or exchange of all or substantially all of the Corporations property,
business or assets not less than twenty (20) days before the date of

   

 the meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States
mail, postage prepaid, directed to the shareholder at the shareholders
address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. When a meeting is
adjourned to another time or place in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ of
this Code of Regulations, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if
the time and place thereof are announced at the meeting in which the
adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may conduct any
business which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the
adjournment is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new
record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned
meeting shall be given to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at the
meeting.

 

SECTION 2.5. _Quorum and Adjourned Meetings_ _._ Unless otherwise provided by
law or the Corporations Articles of Incorporation, a majority of the shares
entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. If less than a majority of the shares
entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders is present in person or
represented by proxy at such meeting, a majority of the shares so represented
may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At any
adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present, any business may
be transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting. The
shareholders present at a meeting may continue to transact business until
adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of such number of shareholders as
may leave less than a quorum.

SECTION 2.6. _Fixing of Record Date_ _._

 

(a) For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to
vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor
less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining shareholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of shareholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

 

(b) For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is established by the Board of Directors,
and which date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date on which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of Directors.
If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date
for determining shareholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Ohio, its
principal office, or an

   

 officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which the
proceedings of meetings of shareholders are recorded. Delivery to the
Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by
the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is required
by law, the record date for determining shareholders consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be the close of business on the day
on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

 

(c) For the purpose of determining the shareholders entitled to receive
payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or
the shareholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect to any change,
conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board of Directors may fix the record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date
is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty (60) days prior
to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
the shareholders for any such purpose shall be the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 

SECTION 2.7. _Voting List_ _._ The officer who has charge of the stock ledger
of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before
every meeting of shareholders, a complete list of shareholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address
of each shareholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
shareholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a
place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be
specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place
where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at
the place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected
by any shareholder who is present.

SECTION 2.8. _Voting_ _._ Unless otherwise provided by the Corporations
Articles of Incorporation, each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote for
each share of capital stock held by each shareholder. In all matters other
than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of the majority of
shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled
to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the shareholders. Directors
shall be elected by plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by a proxy at the meeting entitled to vote on the election of
directors.

SECTION 2.9. _Proxies_ _._  Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of
shareholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for him by
proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy
shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as
long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an
irrevocable power. A proxy may remain irrevocable regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the Corporation generally.

   

SECTION 2.10. _Ratification of Acts of Directors and Officers_ _._ Except
as otherwise provided by law or by the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation, any transaction or contract or act of the Corporation or of the
directors or the officers of the Corporation may be ratified by the
affirmative vote of the holders of the number of shares which would have been
necessary to approve such transaction, contract or act at a meeting of
shareholders, or by the written consent of shareholders in lieu of a meeting.

 

SECTION 2.11. _Informal Action of Shareholders_ _._ Any action required to be
taken at any annual or special meeting of shareholders of the Corporation, or
any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such
shareholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without
a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so
taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to
those shareholders who have not consented in writing. In the event that the
action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a
certificate with any governmental body if such action had been voted on by
shareholders at a meeting thereof, the certificate filed shall state, in lieu
of any statement required by law concerning any vote of shareholders, that
written consent had been given in accordance with the provisions of Section
1701.54 of the Ohio General Corporation Law, and that written notice has been
given as provided in such section.

 

SECTION 2.12. _Organization_ _._ Such person as the Board of Directors may
designate or, in the absence of such a designation, the President of the
Corporation, if there shall be one, or, in his or her absence, such person as
may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who
are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the
shareholders and act as chairman of such meeting. In the absence of the
secretary of the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint a
person to serve as secretary at the meeting.

the home or business address of the director.

 

SECTION 3.7. _Quorum_. A majority of the total number of directors then in

SECTION 3.12. _Participation by Conference Telephone_. Members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee thereof, may participate in a meeting of the
Board of Directors, or any committee thereof, by means of conference telephone
or similar communications equipment as long as all persons participating in

person at such meeting.

 

ARTICLE IV

SECTION 4.1. _Written Waiver of Notice_. A written waiver of any required
notice, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the
date stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Neither the
business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special
meeting of shareholders, directors or members of a committee of directors
need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

SECTION 4.2. _Attendance as Waiver of Notice_. Attendance of a person at a

the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because
the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

ARTICLE V

 

COMMITTEES

SECTION 5.1.  _General Provisions_. The Board of Directors may, by resolution
passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of
a member at any meeting of a committee, the member or members thereof present
at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or
members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint any alternate member of
such committee to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member. Any

   

 such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of
Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it.

SECTION 6.2. _Election and Term of Office_. The officers of the Corporation
shall be elected annually by the Board of Directors at the regular meeting of
the Board of Directors held after each annual meeting of the shareholders (or

election shall be held as soon thereafter as may be convenient. New offices of
the Corporation may be created and filled and vacancies in offices may be

Directors. Unless removed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ of this Code of
Regulations, each officer shall hold office until his successor has been duly
elected and qualified, or until his earlier death or resignation. Election or
appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract
rights.

SECTION 6.3. _Removal of Officers_. Any officer or agent elected or appointed
by the Board of Directors may be removed by the Board of Directors whenever,
in its judgment, the best interests of the Corporation would be served
thereby, but such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights,

SECTION 6.4. _The President_. The President, if there shall be one, shall have

Board of Directors, or in the absence of any designation, then in the order
of their election) shall perform the duties of the President, and when so
acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions
upon the President. The Vice Presidents shall perform such other duties and
have such other powers as the Board of Directors may from time to time
prescribe.

   

SECTION 6.6. _The Secretary_. The Secretary shall attend all meetings of
the Board of Directors and all meetings of the shareholders and record all
the proceedings thereof in a book to be kept for that purpose and shall
perform like duties for the standing committees when required. The Secretary
shall give, or cause to be given, notice of all meetings of the shareholders
and special meetings of the Board of Directors, and shall perform such other
duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors, under whose supervision
he shall be. The Secretary shall have custody of the corporate seal of the
Corporation, if any, and the Secretary shall have authority to affix the same
to any instrument requiring it and when so affixed, it may be attested by his
signature. The Board of Directors may give general authority to any other
officer to affix the seal of the Corporation and to attest the affixing by his
signature.

ARTICLE VII

 

CERTIFICATES FOR SHARES

 

SECTION 7.1. _Certificates of Shares_. The shares of the Corporation shall be
represented by certificates, provided that the Board of Directors of the
Corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any
or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such
resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such
certificate is surrendered to the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of
such a resolution by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock represented
by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall
be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the
Corporation by the President or Vice President, and by the Secretary or
Treasurer of the Corporation representing the number of shares registered in
certificate form. Any or all the signatures on the certificate may be a
facsimile.

SECTION 7.2. _Signatures of Former Officer, Transfer Agent or Registrar_.
In case any officer, transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose
facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be
such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued,
it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person or
entity were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 

SECTION 7.3. _Transfer of Shares_. Transfers of shares of the Corporation
shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the holder of record
thereof or by his legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of
authority to transfer, or by his or her attorney thereunto authorized by power
of attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the
Corporation, and on surrender for cancellation of certificate for such
shares. Prior to due presentment of a certificate for shares for registration
of transfer, the Corporation may treat a registered owner of such shares as
the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications and
otherwise have and exercise all of the right and powers of an owner of shares.
No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for any
purposes until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the
Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

SECTION 7.4. _Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Certificates_. Whenever a certificate
representing shares of the Corporation has been lost, destroyed or stolen, the
holder thereof may file in the office of the Corporation an affidavit setting
forth, to the best of his knowledge and belief, the time, place,
and circumstance of such loss, destruction or theft together with a statement
of indemnity sufficient in the opinion of the Board of Directors to indemnify
the Corporation against any claim that may be made against it on account of
the alleged loss of any such certificate. Thereupon, the Corporation shall
issue to such person or such persons legal representative a new certificate
or a duplicate of the certificate alleged to have been lost, destroyed or
stolen. In the exercise of its discretion, the Board of Directors may waive
the indemnification requirements provided herein.

person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (including, without limitation,
any action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or an officer of the Corporation (and the
Corporation, in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, may so
indemnify a person by reason of the fact that such person is or was an
employee of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation in any other capacity for or on behalf of the Corporation) against
any and all costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages and liabilities actually and
reasonably incurred by such person in respect thereof; provided, however, that
the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify any such person
with respect to proceedings, claims or actions initiated or brought
voluntarily by such person and not by way of defense or brought against such
person in response to a proceeding, claim or action by such person against the
Corporation. Requests for indemnification pursuant to this section shall be
made in writing to the Corporation. Such indemnification is not exclusive of
any other right to indemnification provided by law, agreement or otherwise.
The right to indemnification arising under this section shall not be
eliminated or impaired by an amendment to this section after the occurrence of
the act or omission that is the subject of civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification is sought.
Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a person who is or was a
director or an officer of the Corporation in defending any civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding for which such
person may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such
person is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized
under this section.

 

SECTION 11.2. _Determination of Right to Indemnification_. Unless otherwise
provided by the Corporations Articles of Incorporation, this Code of
Regulations, or a written agreement between the Corporation and the director,
officer or other person, the determination as to the right to indemnification
shall be made by a majority vote of the directors not at the time parties to
the same or related proceedings, even though less than a quorum, or by the
shareholders.

SECTION 11.3. _Primacy of Indemnification; Subrogation; Insurance_. The
Corporation and its subsidiaries shall be the indemnitors of first resort
(i.e., their obligations to provide indemnification and/or advance expenses to
any individual serving as a director, manager or officer of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and collectively, the "
_Indemnitees_ ") under their respective organizational documents and/or any
agreement with an Indemnitee are primary, and any obligation of Cerberus
Capital Management, L.P. (" _Cerberus Management_ "), any of its affiliates or
any fund, trust, collective pool, vehicle or entity that is advised or managed
by Cerberus Management or an affiliate of Cerberus Management, including, but
not limited to, Cerberus Institutional Partners VI, L.P. (collectively, the "
_Fund Entities_ "; provided, however, that the "Fund Entities" shall not
include the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof) to provide indemnification
and/or advance expenses for the same liabilities or expenses incurred by an
Indemnitee are secondary). The Corporation and its subsidiaries shall be
required to provide indemnification and advance expenses to the fullest
extent required by the terms of the applicable organizational documents and/or
any agreement

   

 between the Corporation or any subsidiary and an Indemnitee without regard
to any rights Indemnitee may have against the Fund Entities. Each of the
Corporation and its subsidiaries irrevocably waives, relinquishes and
releases the Fund Entities from any and all claims against the Fund Entities
for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect
thereof. No payment or advancement by the Fund Entities on behalf of
an Indemnitee with respect to any claim for which an Indemnitee has sought or
may seek indemnification from the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries shall
affect the foregoing, and the Fund Entities shall have a right of contribution
and/or to be subrogated to the extent of such payment or advancement by a
Fund Entity to all of the rights of recovery an Indemnitee may have against
the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries under the applicable organizational
documents and/or any agreement between the Corporation or any of its
subsidiary and an Indemnitee. All Fund Entities are express intended third
party beneficiaries of this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_. The Corporation shall cause
each of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, whether held as of the date
hereof or acquired or created hereafter, to be bound by substantially similar
terms and conditions to those in this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_. The Corporation
and its subsidiaries shall use their best efforts to cause their insurance
providers, if any, to satisfy any claims against the Indemnitees arising out
of their service as officers, directors, managers, employees and/or
fiduciaries of the Corporation and its subsidiaries to the fullest extent of
the coverage provided, notwithstanding any other indemnities or insurance
available to any Indemnitee from any Fund Entity. Any repeal or modification
of this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_ shall not adversely affect any rights of any
Indemnitee or Fund Entity pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.3_, in each
case, existing at the time of such repeal or modification with respect to any
acts or omissions occurring prior to such repeal or modification.

FIRPTA Certificate

 

Pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(c)(3) and Section
1.897-2(h)

This certificate (" _Certificate_ ") is being delivered Striker Parent 2018,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Buyer_ "), in connection with
the Agreement and Plan of Merger made and entered into as of December 11, 2018
by and among Buyer, Sparton Corporation (the " _U.S. Entity_ ") and the other
parties listed thereto.

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the " _Code_
") provides that a transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold
tax if the transferor is a foreign person. To inform Buyer that withholding of
tax is not required upon the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, the
undersigned, being a duly appointed officer of the U.S. Entity, does hereby
certify, as of the date of this Certificate, as follows:

 

1\. This Certificate is furnished pursuant to and in accordance with Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.897-2(h)(2) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) in respect of the U.S.
Entity, located at 425 North Martingale Road, Suite 1000, Schaumburg, Illinois
60173 whose employer identification number is [].

2\. The U.S. Entity is not, and has not been at any time during the five (5)
years preceding the date hereof (or such shorter period as may be specified
by Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code), a "United States real property
holding corporation" (as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code).
Accordingly, interests in the U.S. Entity are not "U.S. real property
interests" (as defined in Section 897(c)(1) of the Code).

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this certification on
behalf of the U.S. Entity.
