hereinafter set forth, in consideration of the delivery by Seller of the
Acquired Interests, Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available
United States funds, shall pay to Seller at the Closing an amount equal to (i)

adjustment to reflect the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount (whether

(a) The closing of the transactions described in _Section 2.01_ (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Jones Day, counsel to Seller,
at 51 Louisiana Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20001, or at such other place as

2.04 _Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_.

 



 

(a) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the scheduled Closing Date,
Seller will prepare and deliver to Purchaser a worksheet setting forth
Sellers good faith estimate of the Aggregate Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date (the " _Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount_ "), as
well as a computation thereof (which computation shall be prepared in the same
format and on the same basis used to prepare the Aggregate Target Net Working
Capital Amount as set forth on _Exhibit C_ ). If (i) the Estimated Aggregate
Net Working Capital Amount is greater than the Aggregate Target Net Working
Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased
by an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount and the Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount;
and (ii) the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is less than the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount, the Base Purchase Price payable
at Closing will be decreased by an amount equal to difference between the
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount and the Estimated Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount (such amount under either (i) or (ii) is referred to as
the " _Closing Date Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ ").

 



 

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser will prepare (at
Purchasers expense) and deliver to Seller a worksheet setting forth
Purchasers good faith computation of the actual Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount as of the Closing Date (the " _Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital
Amount_ "), which computation shall be prepared in the same format and on the
same basis used to prepare the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount,
together with a reasonably detailed explanation of, and documentation
reasonably sufficient to confirm the accuracy of the computation of, such
Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount. If within thirty (30) days
following delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation, Seller does
not object in writing thereto to Purchaser, then the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount shall constitute the actual Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount as of the Closing Date for purposes of this Agreement (the "
_Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount_ "). If, within thirty (30) days
following delivery of such worksheet and supporting documentation, Seller
objects in writing thereto to Purchaser (describing in reasonable detail the
specific line items and values that are in dispute and the reasons for such
dispute, and proposing alternative values with respect to such specific line
items) such Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to
the objection and resolution provisions set forth in _Section 2.04(e)_ below.

 



 

(c) If the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is not prepared and
delivered by Purchaser within the thirty (30) day period set forth in _Section
2.04(b)_ above, Seller shall be entitled (but not obligated) during the thirty
(30) day period commencing on the thirty-first (31st) day after the Closing
Date to prepare (at Sellers expense) and deliver to Purchaser a worksheet
setting forth Sellers good faith computation of the Proposed Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount, which computation shall be prepared in the same format
and on the same basis used to prepare the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount, and based upon information available to Seller, and
accompanied by the documentation that supports Sellers determinations and
calculations. If within ten (10) days following delivery of such worksheet and
supporting documentation, Purchaser does not object in writing thereto to
Seller,

 



      
 

 



 

then the Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount submitted by Seller
pursuant to this _Section 2.04(c)_ shall constitute the Final Aggregate Net
Working Capital Amount. If, within ten (10) days following delivery of such
worksheet and supporting documentation, Purchaser objects in writing thereto
to Seller (describing in reasonable detail the specific line items and values
that are in dispute and the reasons for such dispute, and proposing
alternative values with respect to such specific line items), such Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount shall be subject to the objection and
resolution provisions set forth in _Section 2.04(e)_ below.

 



 

(d) If neither Purchaser nor Seller prepare and timely deliver a Proposed
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount in accordance with _Section 2.04(b)_ or
_(c)_ , above, the Estimated Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount delivered at
Closing shall become the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for all
purposes hereunder.

 



 

(e) If Seller timely objects to Purchasers Proposed Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount pursuant to _Section 2.04(b)_ or if Purchaser timely objects to
Sellers Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount pursuant to _Section
2.04(c)_ , then Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and attempt
to resolve the particular items and values that are identified in the
applicable written notice of objection over a twenty (20) day period
commencing on delivery of written notice of objection pursuant to _Section
2.04(b)_ or _(c)_ , as the case may be. Should such negotiations not result in
an agreement as to the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount within such
twenty (20) day period (or such longer period as Purchaser and Seller may
mutually agree), then either Party may submit such disputed items and values
to the Neutral Auditor. Each Party agrees to promptly execute a reasonable
engagement letter, if requested to do so by the Neutral Auditor. Purchaser and
Seller, and their respective Representatives, shall cooperate fully with the
Neutral Auditor. The Neutral Auditor, acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator, shall resolve such disputed items and determine the values to be
ascribed thereto, and using those values (together with other items not in
dispute) determine the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount as of the
Closing Date only (prepared on the same basis used to prepare the Estimated
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount). The Parties hereby agree that the
Neutral Auditor shall only decide the specific disputed items, the values
ascribed thereto and using those values (together with the other items
included in the applicable Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount)
determine the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount, and the Neutral
Auditors decision with respect to such disputed items and values must be
within the range of values assigned to each such item in the applicable
Proposed Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and the notice of objection,
respectively. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally by Purchaser and
Seller. The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to resolve the disputed items
and amounts and deliver to Purchaser and Seller a written determination of the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount (such determination to be made
consistent with this _Section 2.04(e)_ , including a worksheet setting forth
all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be
based solely on information provided to the Neutral Auditor by Purchaser and
Seller) within thirty (30) days after being retained, which determination will
be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and their respective
Affiliates and representatives, successors and assigns. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the dispute resolution

 



      
 

 



 

mechanism contained in this _Section 2.04(e)_ shall be the exclusive mechanism
for resolving disputes, if any, regarding the Aggregate Net Working Capital,
if any, and neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Article 11_ for Losses resulting or arising from the amount of
the Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount or the determination of Aggregate Net
Working Capital.

 



 

(f) The " _Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount_ " shall be
calculated by computing the Closing Day Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount in accordance with _Section 2.04(a)_ but substituting Final
Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount for the Estimated Aggregate Net Working
Capital Amount. The " _Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount_ " shall be the amount equal to (i) the Final Aggregate Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount minus (ii) the Closing Date Aggregate Net Working
Capital Adjustment Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, then Purchaser shall pay in cash to
Seller the amount of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment
Amount. If the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount is
a negative amount, then Seller shall pay in cash to Purchaser the amount equal
to the absolute value of the Post-Closing Aggregate Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount. Any such net excess or deficit payment in respect of the
Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount will be due and payable within
fifteen (15) days after the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount is
finally determined as provided in this _Section 2.04_ and will be payable by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as
shall be specified by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable. Any payments made
pursuant to this _Section 2.04(f)_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

(g) Following the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate and provide
each other and, if applicable the Neutral Auditor, and their respective
representatives, reasonable assistance and access to such books, records and
employees (including those of HoldCo and the Subsidiaries) as are reasonably
requested in connection with the matters addressed in this _Section 2.04_.
Consistent with the foregoing, if Purchaser prepares the worksheet in
accordance with _Section 2.04(b)_ , Purchaser shall, at its expense, provide
or provide reasonable access (in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to its
business) to Seller or the Neutral Auditor to review the books and records,
documents and work papers related to the preparation of the worksheet and
computation of the Final Aggregate Net Working Capital Amount and if Seller
prepares the worksheet in accordance with _Section 2.04(c)_ , then Seller
shall, at its expense, provide or provide reasonable access (in a manner not
unreasonably disruptive to its business) to Purchaser or the Neutral Auditor
to review the books and records, documents and work papers related to the

HoldCo and the Subsidiaries in accordance with good industry practice.

 



 

3.24 _Bank Accounts_. _Schedule 3.24_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth
the names and locations of banks, trust companies and other financial
institutions at which HoldCo or the Subsidiaries maintain bank accounts or
safe deposit boxes, in each case listing the type of account, the account
number, and the names of all Persons authorized to draw thereupon or who have
access thereto and lists the locations of all safe deposit boxes used by
HoldCo or the Subsidiaries.

 



 

3.25 _Regulatory Status_. ESEC is an "exempt wholesale generator" under PUCHA
and FERCs implementing regulations. ESEC is authorized by FERC to make sales
of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates pursuant to
Section 205 of the FPA, has blanket authorization from FERC under Section 204
of the FPA to issue securities and assume liabilities, and has all other
blanket authorizations and waivers from FERC that are customarily granted by
FERC to entities with market-based rate authorization. Except for its market-
based rate tariff, ESEC has no other tariff or rate schedule on file with FERC
and is not required to have any other tariffs or rate schedules on file with
FERC. Each of HoldCo and West Holdings is a "holding company" as defined in
PUHCA solely because of its direct or indirect ownership of ESEC and, as such,
is exempt from regulation under PUHCA as set forth in 18 C.F.R. § 366.3(a).

 



 

3.26 _Disclosures_. To the Knowledge of Seller, no representation or warranty
by Seller contained in this Agreement, and no statement contained in the
Disclosure Schedules or any other document, certificate or other instrument
delivered to or to be delivered by or on behalf of Seller, HoldCo or any
Subsidiary contains, or will contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary, in light of the
circumstances under which it was or will be made, in order to make the
statements herein or therein not misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

3.27 _Projections; Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount_. Seller has
prepared the financial projections for HoldCo and the Subsidiaries, including
levered and unlevered pre-tax and after-tax cash flows reflecting the
anticipated cash tax treatment of such cash flows under Purchasers ownership
(the " _Projections_ ") in good faith, and has developed the assumptions on
which such Projections are based. The Projections (i) are based on reasonable
assumptions, and (ii) are consistent in all material respects with Sellers
budget for the Facility and with the provisions of the Company Contracts
relied upon or taken into account in developing such Projections. The
Aggregate Target Net Working Capital Amount is reasonable for the operation of
the Facility and is consistent in all material respects with Sellers budget
for the Facility.

 



 

3.28 _No Other Warranties_. EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN, THE
ACQUIRED INTERESTS ARE BEING SOLD HEREUNDER ON AN "AS IS," "WHERE IS" BASIS.
THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH HEREIN ARE EXCLUSIVE AND ARE IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS OF ANY KIND OR NATURE WHATSOEVER RELATING TO
HOLDCO, THE SUBSIDIARIES, THE ASSETS OF HOLDCO, THE ASSETS OF THE SUBSIDIARIES
OR THE ACQUIRED INTERESTS.

the Closing, Seller shall consult with Purchaser in respect of remediating the
Casualty Loss, including promptly commencing the restoration work with respect
to such Casualty Loss and promptly filing claims with insurance companies
under applicable insurance policies in respect of such Casualty Loss. To the

expenditures in respect of the Restoration Cost, the amounts of such actual
capital expenditures, up to the amount equal to the Restoration Cost by which
the Base Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.04_) was reduced

Price (as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.04_).

Purchaser the Seller Parent Guaranty.

 **ARTICLE 9 _ 
TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

9.01 _Certain Taxes_.

 



 

(a) All real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar obligations
of HoldCo and the Subsidiaries imposed by the State of California or any other
Governmental Authority that are due or become due for Tax periods within which
the Closing Date occurs (collectively, the " _Apportioned Obligations_ ")
shall be apportioned between Seller for the pre-

 



      
 

 



 

Closing Date period, on the one hand, and Purchaser for the post-Closing Date
Period, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date, based upon the actual
number of days of the Tax period that have elapsed before and after the
Closing Date, and all income Taxes and Transfer Taxes imposed on Holdco and
the Subsidiaries shall be allocated between the pre-Closing Date period and
the post-Closing Date period as though a taxable year of HoldCo and each of
the Subsidiaries have ended on the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible
for the portion of such Apportioned Obligations attributable to the period
ending before the Closing Date. Purchaser shall be responsible for the portion
of such Apportioned Obligations attributable to the period beginning on or
after the Closing Date. Each Party shall cooperate in assuring that
Apportioned Obligations that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to the
preceding sentences are paid by Seller, and that Apportioned Obligations that
are the responsibility of Purchaser pursuant to the preceding sentence shall
be paid by Purchaser. If any refund, rebate or similar payment is received by
HoldCo, any of the Subsidiaries and/or Purchaser for any real property Taxes,
personal property Taxes or similar obligations referred to above that are
Apportioned Obligations, such refund shall be apportioned between Seller and
Purchaser as aforesaid on the basis of the obligations of HoldCo and the
Subsidiaries during the applicable Tax period. Any refund, rebate or similar
payment received by HoldCo, any Subsidiary and/or Purchaser for any income Tax
or Transfer Tax attributable to the pre-Closing Date period, as determined
above, shall be for the benefit of Seller; and any such refund, rebate or
similar payment attributable to the post-Closing Date period, as determined
above, shall be for the benefit of Purchaser.

 



 

(b) For any Taxes with respect to which the taxable period of HoldCo or any
Subsidiary ends before the Closing Date, Seller shall timely prepare and file
with the appropriate authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by
HoldCo or applicable Subsidiary. On and after the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall timely prepare and file with the appropriate authorities all other Tax
Returns required to be filed by HoldCo and the Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Seller and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, employees and agents reasonably to cooperate, in
preparing and filing all Tax Returns of HoldCo and the Subsidiaries, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records that are necessary
for the preparation of any Tax Returns that the Party is required to file
under this _Article 9_, and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect
to such Returns.

 



 

(d) All sales, use transfer, controlling interest transfer, recording, stock
transfer, real property transfer, value-added and other similar Taxes and fees
(" _Transfer Taxes_ "), if any, arising out of or in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
shared equally by Purchaser and Seller. Tax Returns that must be filed in
connection with such Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed by the Party
primarily or customarily responsible under applicable local Law for filing
such Tax Returns, and such party will use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such Tax Returns to the other Party at least ten (10) business days
prior to the date such Tax Returns are due to be filed.

 



      
 

 



 

9.02 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. No later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall agree on the allocation of the Purchase
Price and the liabilities of HoldCo and its Subsidiaries (in each case to the
extent treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) among
HoldCos and the Subsidiaries assets consistent with section 1060 of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Seller and Purchaser agree that the
agreed allocation shall be used by Seller and Purchaser as the basis for
reporting asset values and other items for purposes of all federal, state, and
local Tax returns, including, without limitation, Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 and that neither Seller nor Purchaser or their respective Affiliates
will take positions inconsistent with such allocation in notices to any
Governmental Authority, in audits or other proceedings with respect to Taxes,
or in other documents or notices relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

9.03 _Treatment for Tax Purposes_. For federal and applicable state and local
income tax purposes, the Purchaser and Seller shall treat the Purchasers
acquisition of the Acquired Interests as a sale and purchase of the assets of
HoldCo and its Subsidiaries.

11.01 _Indemnification by Seller_. Seller hereby indemnifies and holds
harmless the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of, and holds each of

sustained by any of them or to which any of them become subject, resulting
from, arising out of or related to any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or obligation made by either Seller in this Agreement or

extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser or
its agents, officers, employees or contractors.

 



 

11.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Purchaser hereby indemnifies and holds
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and holds each of them

covenant, agreement or obligation made by Purchaser in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered by Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing indemnity shall not apply to Losses to the
extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or its
agents, officers, employees or contractors.

 



      
 

 



 

11.03 _Period for Making Claims_. No claim under this Agreement (except as
provided below) may be made unless such Party shall have delivered, with
respect to any claim for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation made in this Agreement, a written notice of claim
prior to the date falling twelve (12) months after the Closing Date _provided_
that, the (i) representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.01_

3.09(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(e)_ (HoldCo and the Subsidiaries), _Section 4.01_

after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of limitations and (iii)
the covenants, agreements and obligations in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to be performed shall survive until the date on which they have been
fully performed; _provided_ _further_ that, if written notice for a claim of
indemnification has been provided by the Indemnified Party pursuant to
_Section 11.05(a)_ on or prior to the applicable survival expiration date,
then the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article 11 shall survive with respect to such claim
until such claim is finally resolved. With respect to any claims related to
violations or possible violations of an applicable NERC reliability standard,
no claim under this Agreement may be made unless such Party shall have

warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation made in this Agreement, a written

any WECC compliance audit covering a period prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

11.04 _Limitations on Claims_.

 



 

(a) Neither Party shall have any obligation to indemnify the other Indemnified
Party until the aggregate amount of all Losses incurred by such Party that are
subject to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 11_ equal or exceed one
percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Deductible_ ") in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for Losses only to the extent they are in
excess of the Deductible; _provided_ that, the Deductible shall not apply to
Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) any willful breach of
any representation or warranty or (ii) fraud.

 



 

(b) Neither Party shall have any obligation to indemnify the other Indemnified
Party in connection with any single item or group of related items that result
in Losses that are subject to indemnification in the aggregate of less than
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).

 



 

(c) The aggregate liability of the Indemnifying Parties under this _Article
11_ resulting from breaches of representations or warranties herein and in any
certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall be limited to an amount equal to
twenty percent (20%) of the Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ that,
the Cap shall not apply to Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating
to (i) any willful breach of any representation or warranty or (ii) fraud.

 



       
 

 



 

(d) The amount of any claim pursuant to this Article 11 will be reduced by the
amount of any insurance proceeds actually recovered (less the cost to collect
the proceeds of such insurance and the amount, if any, of any retroactive or
other premium adjustments reasonably attributable thereto) and the amount of
any Tax benefit (which for this purpose means any reduction in cash Taxes
payable that would otherwise be due or the receipt of a refund of Taxes by the
Indemnified Parties, in each case only with respect to the taxable year in
which the Loss was incurred or paid) to the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim or the facts or events giving rise to such indemnity obligation. If
the Indemnified Party realizes such Tax benefit after the date on which an
indemnity payment has been made to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly make payment to the Indemnifying Party in an amount equal
to such Tax benefit; provided, that such payment shall not exceed the amount
of the indemnity payment.

 



 

11.05 _Procedure for Indemnification of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Notice_. Whenever any claim by a third party shall arise for
indemnification under this _Article 11_, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and, when known, the facts
constituting the basis for such claim and, if known, the notice shall specify
the amount or an estimate of the amount of the liability arising therefrom.
The Indemnified Party shall provide to the Indemnifying Party copies of all
material notices and documents (including court papers) received or
transmitted by the Indemnified Party relating to such claim. The failure or
delay of the Indemnified Party to deliver prompt written notice of a claim
shall not affect the indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party was actually
disadvantaged by such failure or delay in delivery of notice of such claim.

 



 

(b) _Settlement of Losses_. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense
of any claim by a third party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder
pursuant to _Section 11.06(d)_, the Indemnified Party shall not settle,
consent to the entry of a judgment of or compromise such claim without the
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

11.06 _Rights of Indemnifying Party in the Defense of Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) _Right to Assume the Defense_. In connection with any claim by a third
party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder, the Indemnifying Party shall
have thirty (30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of
such claim by the Indemnified Party to assume the defense of any such claim,
which defense shall be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Party to a final
conclusion or settlement in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(b) _Procedure_. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
claim, the Indemnifying Party shall (i) select counsel reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnified Party to conduct the defense of such claim and (ii) take
all steps necessary in the defense or settlement thereof, at its sole cost and
expense. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in (but not
control) the defense of any such claim, with its own counsel and at its sole

 



      
 

 



 

cost and expense; _provided_ that, if the claim includes allegations for which
the Indemnifying Party both would and would not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall in
that case jointly assume the defense thereof. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall fully cooperate with each other and their respective
counsel in the defense or settlement of such claim. The Party in charge of the
defense shall keep the other Party appraised at all times as to the status of
the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _Settlement of Losses_. The Indemnifying Party shall not consent to a
settlement of or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such claim or
legal proceeding, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 



 

(d) _Decline to Assume the Defense_. The Indemnified Party may defend against
any such claim, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, in
such manner as it may deem reasonably appropriate, including settling such
claim in accordance with the terms hereof if (i) the Indemnifying Party does
not assume the defense of any such claim resulting therefrom within thirty
(30) days after the date the Indemnifying Party is notified of such claim by
the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes that
the Indemnifying Party is (a) not diligently defending the Indemnified Person,
(b) not contesting such claim in good faith through appropriate proceedings or
(c) has not taken such action (including the posting of a bond, deposit or
other security) as may be necessary to prevent any action to foreclose a Lien
against or attachment of any asset or property of the Indemnified Party for
payment of such claim.

 



 

11.07 _Direct Claims_. In the event that any Indemnified Party has a claim
against any Indemnifying Party which may give rise to indemnity hereunder that
does not involve a claim brought by a third party, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim and the facts constituting
the basis for such claim and, if known, the amount or an estimate of the
amount of the liability arising therefrom. If the Indemnifying Party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days from receipt of such
claim notice that the Indemnifying Party disputes such claim, the amount of
such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party
hereunder; however if the Indemnifying Party does notify the Indemnified Party
that it disputes such claim within the require thirty (30) day period, the
Parties shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
Parties with respect to such claim. If the Parties should so agree, a
memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both
Parties. If such Parties shall not agree, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to take any action in law or in equity as such Indemnified Party
shall deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this Article 11 against the
Indemnifying Party.

 



 

11.08 _Exclusive Remedy_. Absent fraud or willful breach, the indemnities set
forth in this _Article 11_ shall be the exclusive remedies of Purchaser and
Seller and their respective members, officers, directors, employees, agents
and Affiliates due to misrepresentation, breach of warranty, nonfulfillment or
failure to perform any covenant or agreement contained in this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, and the Parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this
Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature
whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the Parties hereto hereby waive.

 



 

11.09 _Indemnity Treatment_. Any amount of indemnification payable pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article 11_ shall to the extent possible, be treated
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 



 

11.10 _Mitigation_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate their respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder.

 



 

(b) Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any indemnification
claim pursuant to this _Article 11_, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights which the Indemnified
Party may have against any third parties with respect to the subject matter
underlying such indemnification claim and the Indemnified Party shall assign
any such rights to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

11.11 _No Solicitation_. Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit
HoldCo, any Subsidiary, any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate,
facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter
into discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any
Person concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any
agreements or other instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an
Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, and shall cause HoldCo, any Subsidiary, any of its Affiliates and
all of its and their Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes hereof, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person concerning (a) a merger,
consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, share exchange or other business
combination transaction involving HoldCo or any Subsidiary; (b) the issuance
or acquisition of equity securities of HoldCo or any Subsidiary; or (c) the
sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any significant portion of
HoldCos or any Subsidiarys properties or assets.

interpreted to broaden Sellers or Purchasers representations, warranties,

Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code (the " ** _Code_** ") provides that
a transferee (buyer) of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the
transferor (seller) is a foreign person. For U.S. tax purposes (including
section 1445), the owner of a disregarded entity (which has legal title to a
U.S. real property interest under local law) will be the transferor of the
property and not the disregarded entity. To inform NRG Yield Operating LLC
that withholding of tax is not required upon the disposition of a U.S. real
property interest by NRG Energy, Inc., the undersigned hereby certifies:

 



 

1. NRG Energy, Inc. is not a foreign corporation, foreign partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as those terms are defined in the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder);

 



 

2. NRG Energy, Inc. is not a disregarded entity as defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii);

 



 

3. NRG Energy, Inc.s U.S employer identification number is [*]; and

 



 

4. NRG Energy, Inc. office address is:

 



 

211 Carnegie Center

 

Princeton, NJ 08540

 



 

NRG Energy, Inc. understands that this certification may be disclosed to the
Internal Revenue Service by NRG Yield Operating LLC and that any false
statement contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

 



 

Under penalties of perjury I declare that I have examined this certification
and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true, correct and complete,
and I further declare that I have authority to sign this document on behalf of
NRG Energy, Inc.

 **EXHIBIT I**

 

 **SELLER PARENT GUARANTY**

 



 

 **NRG ENERGY, INC.**

 



 

THIS GUARANTY (" **Guaranty** "), effective as of May , 2014, by NRG
Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" **Guarantor** "), is to and for the
benefit of NRG Yield Operating LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
**Buyer** ") and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties (collectively, "
**Beneficiary** "). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meaning given such terms in the Contract (as such term is defined below).

 



 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 



 

WHEREAS, NRG Gas Development Company, LLC (" **Obligor** ") and Buyer have of
even date herewith entered into that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement (as
such agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the
" **Contract** ") for the sale by Obligor to Buyer of the Acquired Interests;

 



 

WHEREAS, Obligor is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Guarantor; and

 



 

WHEREAS, _Section 5.07_ of the Contract requires that this Guaranty be
executed and delivered by Guarantor concurrently with the execution of the
Contract;

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration and as an inducement to Buyer to
enter into the Contract, Guarantor covenants with Obligor as follows:

 



 

1. Guarantor hereby unconditionally guarantees to Beneficiary the full and timely performance when due, the payment of all amounts when due and owing, and observance when due of all covenants, terms and agreements to be performed, paid or observed, as applicable, by Obligor under the Contract, all whether presently existing or from time to time hereafter created, incurred or arising (collectively, the "Obligations"). Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall not modify or expand the Obligations under the Contract (which Obligations shall be limited as expressly set forth in the Contract). This Guaranty is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all Obligations whenever arising.

 



 

2. Guarantor covenants to Buyer that if at any time Obligor defaults in the payment or performance when due of any of its Obligations, Guarantor shall, promptly upon written notice by Beneficiary (provided that no notice is required in case of an automatic stay), pay or perform, or cause the payment or performance of, such Obligations.

 



 

3. It is expressly understood and agreed by Guarantor that, to the extent Guarantors obligations hereunder relate to Obligations which require performance other than the payment of 

 



      
 

 



 

money, Beneficiary may proceed against Guarantor to effect specific
performance thereof (to the extent such relief is available) or for payment of
damages (as limited by the Contract) resulting from Obligors nonperformance.
Subject to the provisions of Section 16 hereof, Guarantor hereby covenants to
perform or cause to be performed all of the obligations, terms and conditions
on the part of Obligor to be performed under the Contract for the balance of
the term thereof. Should the Contract be disaffirmed by the trustee in
bankruptcy for Obligor, then (without limiting the provisions of Section 6(h))
at the option of Buyer, and subject to the provisions of Section 16 hereof,
Guarantor shall make and enter into a new agreement to perform or cause to be
performed the balance of the Obligations, which new agreement shall be in form
and substance identical to the Contract.

 



 

4. All payments by Guarantor to Beneficiary shall be made in the United States in United States Dollars and shall be paid within thirty (30) days after receipt by Guarantor from Buyer of written demand for such payment (except in those circumstances where giving such demand is prevented by an automatic stay) and shall not be the subject of any offset against any amounts which may be owed by Beneficiary to Guarantor for any reason unrelated to the Contract. Each and every default or failure by Obligor in making a payment or otherwise discharging or performing any of the Obligations shall give rise to a separate liability of such Obligor to Beneficiary and a separate cause of action hereunder and a separate suit may be brought hereunder as each liability or cause of action arises.

 



 

5. Guarantor agrees to pay all costs, expenses and fees, including all reasonable attorneys fees, which may be incurred by Beneficiary in enforcing this Guaranty, whether by suit or otherwise, but only to the extent payment or performance under this Guaranty is otherwise due and Beneficiary is the prevailing party in its claim against Guarantor.

 



 

6. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional, except to the extent that Obligors payment or performance would be excused by Beneficiarys failure to fulfill its obligations under the Contract, and shall remain in full force and effect until such time as set forth in _Section 16_ hereof. The obligations of Guarantor shall not be affected, modified or impaired or prejudiced (i) by any other security now or hereafter held by Beneficiary as security for the obligations of the Obligor under the Contract; or (ii) upon the happening from time to time of any one or more of the following whether or not with notice to or consent of Obligor (except to the extent that Obligors consent may be required to effectuate a modification of the Contract) or Guarantor:

 



 

(a) the taking of any action by Beneficiary to enforce any Obligation or the
Contract against Obligor;

 



 

(b) the compromise, settlement, release, change, modification, rescission or
termination of any of the Obligations;

 



 

(c) the waiver by Beneficiary of the payment, performance or observance of any
of Obligations;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) the extension of time for payment of any amounts due or of the time for
performance of any of the Obligations;

 



 

(e) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any of
the Obligations;

 



 

(f) the failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of Beneficiary to
enforce, ascertain or exercise any right, power or remedy under or pursuant to
the terms of the Contracts or this Guaranty;

 



 

(g) the fact that Guarantor may at any time in the future dispose of all or
any part of its interest in Obligor, or otherwise alter its investment in
Obligor in any manner;

 



 

(h) the bankruptcy, insolvency, winding up, dissolution, liquidation,
administration, reorganization or other similar or dissimilar failure or
financial disability of Obligor, or any legal limitation, disability,
incapacity or other circumstances relating to Obligor;

 



 

(i) the addition or substitution of any guarantor, maker or other third party
primarily or secondarily liable or responsible for the performance or
observance of any of the Obligations or by any extension, waiver, amendment or
thing whatsoever which may release or discharge (in whole or in part) any such
guarantor, maker or other third party (other than as a result of the
indefeasible payment and performance of the Obligations in full);

 



 

(j) the invalidity, nonbinding effect or unenforceability of (x) the
Obligations or (y) the Contract in its entirety; or

 



 

(k) the taking, variation, renewal, addition, substitution, subordination, or
partial or entire release of any security for the Obligations or the
enforcement or neglect to perfect or enforce any such security.

 



 

7. Guarantor irrevocably and absolutely waives any and all right of subrogation, contribution, indemnification, reimbursement or similar rights against Obligor with respect to the Guaranty, whether such rights arise under an express or implied contract or by operation of law, it being the intention of Guarantor and Buyer that Guarantor shall not be deemed to be a "creditor" (as defined in Section 101 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law) of Obligor by reason of the existence of this Guaranty in the event that Obligor becomes a debtor in any proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law. In addition, Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until all of the Obligations shall have indefeasibly been paid or performed in full. If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all the Obligations shall not have been indefeasibly paid or performed in full, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Beneficiary and shall forthwith be paid to Beneficiary and applied to such liabilities and obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

 



       
 

 



 

8. Beneficiary shall have the right, in its sole judgment and discretion, from time to time, to make demand for payment or performance and to proceed against Guarantor for recovery of the total of any and all amounts due, or for the performance of any nonmonetary obligation owed, to Beneficiary pursuant to this Guaranty, or to proceed from time to time against Guarantor for such portion of any and all such amounts, or for the performance of any and all such nonmonetary obligations, as Beneficiary may determine.

 



 

9. So long as any Obligations are owed to Beneficiary, Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, commence or join with any other Person in commencing, any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding against Obligor. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered, limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the winding up, dissolution, administration, bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement or similar proceeding of Obligor, or by any defense which Obligor may have by reason of any order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

 



 

10. With respect to all Obligations, this is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection, and Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, including without limitation:

 



 

(a) any right to require Beneficiary to proceed against Obligor or any other
person or to proceed against or exhaust any security held by Beneficiary at
any time or to pursue any other remedy in Beneficiarys power before
proceeding against Guarantor;

 



 

(b) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority,
death or disability of any other person or the failure of Beneficiary to file
or enforce a claim against the estate (in administration, bankruptcy or any
other proceeding) of any other person;

 



 

(c) any demand, presentment, protest and notice of any kind except as
otherwise required under this Guaranty, including without limitation (i)
notice of the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional
Obligations, (ii) notice of any breach or default by Obligor under the
Contract or of any action or non-action on the part of Beneficiary, Obligor,
any creditor of Obligor or Guarantor or on the part of any other person under
this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of
indebtedness held by Beneficiary as collateral or in connection with any
Obligations hereby guaranteed;

 



 

(d) any defense based upon an election of remedies by Beneficiary which
destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of Guarantor, the right
of Guarantor to proceed against Obligor for reimbursement, or both;

 



 

(e) any duty on the part of Beneficiary to disclose to Guarantor any facts
Beneficiary may now or hereafter know about Obligor, regardless of whether
Beneficiary has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the
risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to assume, or has reason to believe
that such facts are unknown to Guarantor, or has a

 



      
 

 



 

reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Guarantor, since Guarantor
acknowledges that Guarantor is fully responsible for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of Obligor and of all circumstances
bearing on the risk of non-payment of any Obligations hereby guaranteed; and

 



 

(f) any defense arising because of the exercise of any right or remedy
available to, or election made by, Beneficiary pursuant to the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, whether as an unsecured or undersecured creditor, seeking
adequate protection, or otherwise.

 



 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 10 to the contrary,
Guarantor hereby reserves to itself all rights to which Obligor is or may be
entitled arising from or in connection with each of the Contract and the
Obligations, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency,
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor or the incapacity or lack of authority
of Obligor to enter into or perform its obligations under the Contract, and
all rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors
based on the defense of the statute of limitations related to the
enforceability of this Guaranty in any action hereunder or in any action for
the payment or performance of any Obligations hereby guaranteed.

 



 

11. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that Guarantor may not make an assignment or other transfer of this Guaranty or any interest herein by operation of law or otherwise unless it has obtained the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall be solely within Buyers discretion) to such assignment or other transfer. Buyer may collaterally assign its rights under this Guaranty to any Lender.

 



 

12. All notices to Guarantor required to be served under this Guaranty shall be in writing and shall be served by registered mail and shall be addressed as follows:

or at such other address Guarantor may from time to time designate in writing.

 



 

13. This Guaranty shall in all respects be interpreted, and construed and governed by and in accordance with, the internal, substantive laws of the State of New York and the United States of America. All agreements, instruments and notices referred to herein or supplementary hereto shall be prepared, furnished in, and governed, and controlled by the English language. Guarantor irrevocably consents that any action, suit or proceeding by or among Buyer and Guarantor must be brought in whichever of the state or federal courts located in the County of New York, State of New York, has subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute and waives any objection which Guarantor may now or hereafter have regarding the choice of forum whether on

 



      
 

 



 

personal jurisdiction, venue, forum non conveniens or on any other ground.
Guarantor irrevocably consents that it is subject to the personal jurisdiction
of the state or federal courts located in the County of New York, State of New
York. Guarantor irrevocably consents to the service of process outside of the
territorial jurisdiction of such courts by mailing copies thereof by
registered or certified United States mail, postage prepaid, to Guarantors
last known address as shown in the records of Buyer. In addition, Guarantor
consents to the service of process at 211 Carnegie Center Blvd., Attention:
Chief Risk Officer. Nothing in this Guaranty shall affect the right to service
of process in any other manner permitted by law. Guarantor further agrees that
final judgment against it in any action or proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in any other jurisdiction within or outside the State of New
York by suit on the judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall
be conclusive evidence of the fact and the amount of such judgment. Any
finding of fact by, and any interim or final award or judgment made by an
arbitrator, a court or tribunal with jurisdiction over a claim (in either
case, brought pursuant to Section 13.10 of the Contract) under the Contract
shall be binding on Guarantor to the same extent that it is binding on Seller
for the purposes of this Guaranty.

 



 

14. Guarantor represents, covenants and agrees to and with Buyer that:

 



 

(a) Guarantor (i) is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) is duly
qualified, authorized to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction
where the character of its properties or the nature of its activities makes
such qualification necessary;

 



 

(b) the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and its performance have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Guarantor;

 



 

(c) this Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered by Guarantor and is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Guarantor, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, subject to the application of bankruptcy and
similar laws and of general equitable principles;

 



 

(d) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty will not (i)
conflict with or violate any provision of Guarantors Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) conflict with or violate any law or (iii)
conflict with, violate or constitute a default under, any provision of any
security issued by Guarantor or of any agreement, instrument or undertaking to
which Guarantor is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound (or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration thereunder
with or without the giving of notice, the lapse of time, or both), and do not
require any license, consent or approval of any governmental authority;

 



 

(e) except as disclosed in Guarantors public filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before
any arbitrator or governmental authority or order is pending or, to
Guarantors knowledge, threatened by or against Guarantor or any of its
subsidiaries or against any of such parties properties or revenues which, if
adversely determined, would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on

 



      
 

 



 

the ability on Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder;

 



 

(f) Guarantor is not a party to, nor has it received, written notice of any
pending or, to the knowledge of Guarantor, threatened material action against
Guarantor that would prevent, hinder, modify, delay or challenge the
execution, delivery or performance by Guarantor of this Guaranty or the
validity or enforceability hereof; and

 



 

(g) it has established adequate means of obtaining financial and other
information pertaining to the business, operations and condition (financial or
otherwise) of Obligor and its respective properties on a continuing basis, and
Guarantor is and hereafter will be completely familiar with the business,
operations and condition (financial and otherwise) of Obligor and its
respective properties.

 



 

15. Guarantor agrees that:

 



 

(a) It will maintain in full force and effect all consents of any governmental
or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this
Guaranty and will obtain any that may become necessary in the future for the
payment and performance of the Obligations;

 



 

(b) It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and
orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially
impair its ability to perform the Obligations;

 



 

(c) Guarantor will, or will cause Obligor to, deliver to Buyer from time to
time, such other reasonable information or documents regarding Guarantor
relating to any event that may materially or adversely affect Guarantors
ability to perform the Obligations as Buyer may reasonably request and as may
be available to Guarantor without undue cost or effort; provided, however,
that Guarantor may impose reasonable confidentiality requirements in
connection with the disclosure of such information or documents.

 



 

16. Termination; Reinstatement of Guaranty.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of _Section 16(b)_, this Guaranty shall
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the full satisfaction of all
Obligations of Obligor arising under the Contract (and such satisfaction is
not disputed in good faith by Buyer) and the period for making claims set
forth in Section 10.2 of the Contract has expired; _provided, however,_ that
notwithstanding anything in the Contract to the contrary, for purposes of this
Guaranty such period shall be deemed to expire as of the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the effective date of the Contract, and (ii) the termination of
the Contract (other than a termination by Buyer as a result of a breach of the
Contract by Obligor); _provided_ , _however_ , that Guarantors liability
hereunder shall survive any such termination with respect to any claims made
by Beneficiary hereunder with respect to matters arising prior to such
termination.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 16(a)_, this Guaranty shall be
reinstated if at any time following the termination of this Guaranty under
_Section 16(a)_, any payment by Guarantor or Obligor of the Obligations is
rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Beneficiary upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor, all as
though such payment had not been made. Such period of reinstatement shall
continue until satisfaction of the conditions contained in, and shall continue
to be subject to, the provisions of this _Section 16_.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 16(a)_, this Guaranty shall remain in effect
notwithstanding any assignment of the Contract by Obligor to any affiliate or
subsidiary of such Obligor or Guarantor permitted under the terms of the
Contract. Upon request by Buyer after any such assignment, Guarantor shall
acknowledge the continuing effectiveness of this Guaranty notwithstanding such
assignment.

 



 

17. Any invalid or unenforceable provisions in this Guaranty shall be deemed severed herefrom, and such whole or partial invalidity shall not affect the enforceability or validity of the balance of this Guaranty.

 



 

18. No failure on the part of Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by Beneficiary of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to Beneficiary or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by Beneficiary at any time or from time to time.

 



 

19. This Guaranty may be executed in counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 



 

20. This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between Guarantor and Beneficiary with respect to the subject matter hereof. Neither this Guaranty nor any of the terms hereof may be terminated, amended, supplemented, waived or modified orally, except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which the enforcement of this termination, amendment, supplement, waiver or modification shall be sought.
