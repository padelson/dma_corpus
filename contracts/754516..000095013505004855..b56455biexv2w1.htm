reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Exchange Agent</U>. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and
the Company (the &#147;Exchange Agent&#148;), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent
in accordance with this Section&nbsp;2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.1(d) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock (the &#147;Exchange Fund&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Exchange Procedures</U>. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within
eight Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to
each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a &#147;Certificate&#148;) (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal in
customary form and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to
the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article&nbsp;II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;2.2.

accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving

Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock
who has not previously complied with this Section&nbsp;2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the
Buyer payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such
withheld amounts (i)&nbsp;shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, to the applicable Governmental Entity (as defined below), and (ii)&nbsp;shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the

or equity securities of the Company hereafter acquired by any Stockholder prior to the termination

into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;),
pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, a subsidiary of Buyer will
be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will be the surviving corporation (the
&#147;Merger&#148;); and

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the Merger Agreement, Buyer

Agreement, the Stockholder is willing to enter into this Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements
contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree, severally and
not jointly, as follows:

accordance with the terms hereof, the Stockholder shall (a)&nbsp;appear at the Company Meeting or any
other meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or otherwise cause his, her or
its Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum, (b)&nbsp;vote in favor
of any proposal to adjourn such meeting if necessary to permit the further solicitation of proxies
in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of such meeting to approve the Merger
Agreement, (c)&nbsp;vote, or cause to be voted, all of his, her or its Shares (i)&nbsp;in favor of the
approval of the Merger Agreement, and (ii)&nbsp;against approval of any Alternative Acquisition
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Subject to the last sentence of this Section&nbsp;1(b), the Stockholder hereby irrevocably (to
the extent permitted by law) grants to, and appoints, the Buyer as its proxy and attorney-in-fact
(with full power of substitution), for and in its name, place and stead, to vote his, her or its
Shares, if the Stockholder is unable to perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement,
at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to any of the matters
specified in, and solely in accordance and consistent with, Section&nbsp;1(a). The Stockholder hereby
affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 1(b) is given in connection with the
execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the
performance of the obligations of the Stockholder under this Agreement. Except as otherwise
provided for herein, the Stockholder hereby affirms that the appointment of the proxy is coupled
with an interest and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section&nbsp;7.22
of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, the irrevocable proxy granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the
termination of this Agreement.

the Stockholder is bound, or (ii)&nbsp;any law applicable to the Stockholder or by which the Stockholder
is bound. Except as expressly contemplated hereby, the Stockholder is not a party to, and the
Shares are not subject to or bound in any manner by, any contract or agreement relating to the
Shares, including without limitation, any voting agreement, option agreement, purchase agreement,
stockholders&#146; agreement, partnership agreement or voting trust.
</DIV>
