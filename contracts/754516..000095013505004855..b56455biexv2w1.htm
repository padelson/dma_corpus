AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is entered into as of August 18, 2005, by and among EAS Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), XL Acquisition Corp., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the "Transitory Subsidiary"), and Brooktrout, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the Agreement and voted to recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve the Agreement, the Merger (as defined below) and the other transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Buyer has approved the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and the Board of Directors of the Transitory Subsidiary has adopted the Agreement and voted to recommend that the Buyer approve the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 WHEREAS, the acquisition of the Company shall be effected through a merger (the "Merger") of the Transitory Subsidiary with and into the Company in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (the "MBCA"), as a result of which the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer; and 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and as a condition and inducement to the Buyers willingness to enter into this Agreement, the stockholders of the Company listed on _Schedule A_ have entered into Stockholder Voting Agreements, dated as of the date of this Agreement, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (the "Company Stockholder Agreements"), pursuant to which such stockholders have, among other things, agreed to vote, or give the Buyer a proxy to vote, all of the shares of capital stock of the Company that such stockholders own in favor of the Company Voting Proposal (as defined below); 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I. THE MERGER 

   

 1.1 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, prior to the Closing, the Buyer and the Company shall jointly prepare, and immediately following the Closing the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be filed with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, articles of merger (the "Articles of Merger") in such form as is required by, and executed by the Transitory Subsidiary and the Company in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the MBCA and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at such later time as is established by the Buyer and the Company and set forth in the Articles of Merger (the "Effective Time"). 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the Company (the "Closing Date"), which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, 60 State Street, Boston, Massachusetts, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Business Day" shall be any day other than (a) a Saturday or Sunday or (b) a day on which banking institutions located in Boston, Massachusetts are permitted or required by law, executive order or governmental decree to remain closed. 

  

 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time the separate existence of the Transitory Subsidiary shall cease and the Transitory Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company (the Company following the Effective Time is sometimes referred to herein as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Company, each as amended and in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall be the Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 11.07 of the MBCA. 

  

ARTICLE II. CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

 2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Transitory Subsidiary: 

  

 (a) _Capital Stock of the Transitory Subsidiary_. Each share of the common stock of the Transitory Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that are owned by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $13.00 in cash per share (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with 

    ##### 

  

 

respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.2, without interest. 

   

 (d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows: 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(d) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the "Exchange Fund"). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable (and in any event within eight Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2. 

   

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were 

    ##### 

  

 

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in
this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for two hundred seventy (270) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its claim for Merger Consideration. 

   

 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

   

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity (as defined below), and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be. 

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 2.3 _Company Stock Plans_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any option to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") under any stock option plans or other equity-related plans of the Company (the "Company Stock Plans"), each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (i) shall be canceled and terminated and (ii) (A) in the case of Company Stock Options that would have been vested or exercisable as of the Effective Time but for such cancellation and termination (giving effect to the terms of any applicable Company Stock Plan or agreement with the Company relating to such Company Stock Option providing for the acceleration of the vesting or exercisability of such Company Stock Option at or prior to the Effective Time) ("Vested Options"), shall represent the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Option Consideration (as defined below) for each share of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option as of the Effective Time 

    ##### 

  

 

and (B) in the case of Company Stock Options that would not have been vested
or exercisable as of the Effective Time even without giving effect to such
cancellation and termination, shall be replaced with an incentive plan to be
determined by the Board of Directors of the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation following the Closing. 

   

 (b) Each holder of a Vested Option shall receive from the Buyer, in respect and in consideration of each Vested Option canceled and terminated pursuant to clause (a) above, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time (and in any event within eight Business Days), an amount (net of applicable taxes) equal to the product of (i) the amount, if any, by which (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock exceeds (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Option, without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise price of any Vested Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Vested Option shall be canceled and have no further effect, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to participate in an incentive plan to be determined by the Board of Directors of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation following the Closing. 

   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options. The Buyer shall at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3. If requested by the Buyer not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall coordinate with the Buyer and the Exchange Agent to have the Option Consideration paid through the Companys payroll system. 

   

 (d) The Company shall terminate its Second Amended and Restated 1992 Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the "Company ESPP"), in accordance with its terms as of or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. 

  

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who has made a demand for appraisal of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the MBCA (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the MBCA with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the MBCA to a holder of Dissenting Shares. 

   

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive 

    ##### 

  

 

Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon,
upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares. 

   

 (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the MBCA, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the MBCA that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

All of the outstanding shares of capital stock and other equity securities or interests of each Subsidiary of the Company are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and all such shares (other than directors qualifying shares in the case of non-U.S. Subsidiaries, all of which the Company has the power to cause to be transferred for no or nominal consideration to the Company or the Companys designee) are owned, of record and beneficially, by the Company or another of its Subsidiaries free and clear of all security interests, liens, claims, pledges, agreements, limitations in the Companys voting rights, charges or other encumbrances.

 3.5 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Information Provided_. 

  

 (a) The Company has filed all registration statements, forms, reports and other documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2003.

The Company SEC Reports (i) were or will be filed on a timely basis, (ii) at the time filed, complied, or will comply when filed, as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports, and (iii) did not or will not at the time they were or are filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated in such Company SEC Reports or necessary in order to make the statements in such Company SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any related notes and schedules) contained or to be contained in the Company SEC Reports at the time filed (i) complied or will comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) were or will be prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case of unaudited interim 

    ##### 

  

    

financial statements, as permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q under the Exchange
Act), and (iii) fairly presented or will fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of its
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that the unaudited
interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments in immaterial amounts. The consolidated, unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of June 30, 2005 is referred to herein as the
"Company Balance Sheet." The principal executive officer of Company and
the principal financial officer of Company (and each former principal
executive officer or principal financial officer of Company) have made the
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"), and the rules and regulations of the
SEC promulgated thereunder, with respect to the Company SEC Reports filed
since such certifications have been required. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial officer"
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since
December 31, 2004, to the Companys Knowledge, no former or current employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any member of the Companys
public auditing firm, has alleged in writing to any of the executive officers
of the Company that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in
questionable accounting or auditing practices. 

   

 (c) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion in the proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company (the "Proxy Statement") in connection with the Company Meeting shall not, on the date the Proxy Statement is first mailed to stockholders of the Company, at the time of the Company Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any statement that, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it shall be made, is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the Proxy Statement not false or misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were or shall be made; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the Company Meeting that has become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Company Meeting any fact or event relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that should be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement should be discovered by the Company or should occur, the Company shall, promptly after becoming aware thereof, inform the Buyer of such fact or event. 

   

 (d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning the Company is made known on a timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company is in compliance with the applicable listing and other rules and regulations of The NASDAQ National Market.

Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in the Company Balance Sheet and except for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent in all material respects with past practice (the "Ordinary Course of Business") after the date of the Company Balance Sheet, the Company and its Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities of any nature required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company that, individually or in the aggregate, 

   ##### 

  

 

are reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in the Companys SEC Reports or set forth in Section 3.6 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is obligated to guaranty or assume any dividend or any material debt or other
obligation of any person, corporation, association, partnership or other
entity. 

   

 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, since the date of the Company Balance Sheet, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the Ordinary Course of Business and (b) there has not been (i) a Company Material Adverse Effect or (ii) any other action or event that would have required the consent of the Buyer under Section 5.1 (other than paragraphs (b), (f) and (g) of Section 5.1) had such action or event occurred after the date of this Agreement. 

  

 3.8 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have filed all Tax Returns that it was required to file, and all such Tax Returns were correct and complete, except for any failure to file or errors or omissions that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid on a timely basis all Taxes that are shown to be due on any such Tax Returns. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods through the date of the Company Balance Sheet do not exceed the accruals and reserves for Taxes set forth on the Company Balance Sheet exclusive of any accruals and reserves for "deferred taxes" or similar items that reflect timing differences between Tax and financial accounting principles. All liabilities for Taxes that arose since the date of the Company Balance Sheet arose in the Ordinary Course of Business. All Taxes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or was required by law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid to the proper Governmental Entity. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Taxes" means all taxes, charges, fees, levies or other similar assessments or liabilities, including income, gross receipts, ad valorem, premium, value-added, excise, real property, personal property, sales, use, services, transfer, withholding, employment, payroll and franchise taxes imposed by the United States of America or any state, local or foreign government, or any agency thereof, or other political subdivision of the United States or any such government, and any interest, fines, penalties, assessments or additions to tax resulting from, attributable to or incurred in connection with any tax or any contest or dispute thereof and (ii) "Tax Returns" means all reports, returns, declarations, statements or other information required to be supplied to a taxing authority in connection with Taxes. 

   

 (b) The Company has made available to the Buyer correct and complete copies of all federal income Tax Returns, examination reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by the Company since January 1, 2001. The federal income Tax Returns of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been audited by the Internal Revenue Service or are closed by the applicable statute of limitations for all taxable years through the taxable year specified in Section 3.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company has made available to the Buyer correct and complete copies of all other Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries together with all related examination reports and statements of 

     ##### 

 

   

deficiency for all periods from and after January 1, 2001. No examination or
audit of any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any
Governmental Entity is currently in progress or, to the actual knowledge as
of the date hereof of the individuals identified in the Preamble to the
Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Companys Knowledge"), threatened or
contemplated and which is reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has been informed by any Governmental Entity that the
Governmental Entity believes that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was
required to file any Tax Return that was not filed. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has waived any statute of limitations with respect to
Taxes or agreed to an extension of time with respect to a Tax assessment or
deficiency. 

   

 (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) has made any payments, is obligated to make any payments, or is a party to any agreement that could obligate it to make any payments that will be treated as an "excess parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code; or (ii) has any actual or potential liability for any Taxes of any person (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of law in any jurisdiction), or as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. 

   

 (d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is or has ever been a member of a group of corporations with which it has filed (or been required to file) consolidated, combined or unitary Tax Returns, other than a group of which only the Company and its Subsidiaries are or were members or (ii) is a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax sharing or Tax allocation agreement. 

   

 (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have effected reduction in force of its employees or taken any other action that is likely to increase materially unemployment Taxes, charges or assessments to the Company or its Subsidiaries from current rates. 

   

 (f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the approval of this Agreement at the Company Meeting (the "Specified Time"),
the Company may, to the extent failure to do so could reasonably constitute a
breach of fiduciary obligations of the Company Board under applicable law, as
determined in good faith by the Company Board after 

    ##### 

  

    

consultation with outside counsel, (A) in response to a Superior Proposal or a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal made or received after
the date of this Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith
after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, in each case that did not
result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1, and subject to
compliance with Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not, in the
aggregate, less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations (including
solicitation of a revised Superior Proposal or Acquisition Proposal)
with such person and its Representatives regarding any Superior Proposal or
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) in response to a Superior Proposal or an
inquiry that is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, in each
case that did not result from a breach by the Company of this Section 6.1,

release under, any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any
Company Common Stock. 

   

 (b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company Board shall not:

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may (x) withdraw or modify the recommendation by the Company
Board with respect to the Company Voting Proposal, and (y) in the event the
withdrawal or modification is in response to a Superior Proposal, approve or
recommend such Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement, if, in the
case of clauses (x) and (y), the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so could
reasonably constitute a breach of its fiduciary obligations under applicable
law; but in the event the withdrawal or modification is in response to a
Superior Proposal, such withdrawal or modification shall occur only (A) at a
time that is after the third Business Day following Buyers receipt of
written notice advising the Buyer that the Company Board desires to withdraw
or modify the recommendation due to the existence of a Superior Proposal or
an Acquisition Proposal reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and

binding, written and complete (including 

     ##### 

 

   

schedules and exhibits) offer (a "New Offer") to amend the terms of this
Agreement to include terms that are, as determined in good faith by the
Company Board, at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as
such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that the Company shall not
enter into a binding agreement in respect of such Superior Proposal during
such three Business Day period). The Company agrees that, during the period
of three Business Days prior to terminating this Agreement to enter into an
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board shall
consider in good faith the revisions to the terms of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by Buyer.
Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed to (A) permit the Company to take
any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this
Section 6.1(b), or (B) affect any obligation of the Company under this
Agreement or (C) limit the Companys obligation to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Meeting, regardless of whether the Company Board

 (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_.

 (e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

provide the Buyers officers and employees reasonable access to the Companys
customers and suppliers, provided that such access shall at all times be
granted only if such access is scheduled in advance with the Company and only

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with the Buyer, may adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Companys stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Meeting. 

  

 6.6 _Legal Conditions to the Merger_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms hereof, including Section 6.1 and Section 6.6(b), the Company and the Buyer shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, (ii) as promptly as practicable, obtain from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company or the Buyer or any of their Subsidiaries in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the HSR Act and any related governmental request thereunder, and (C) any other applicable law, and (iv) execute or deliver any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing to be made pursuant to the rules and regulations of any applicable law

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Buyer and the Company agree that nothing contained in
this Section 6.6(a) shall modify or affect their respective rights and
responsibilities under Section 6.6(b). 

   

 (b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Buyer and the Company agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for Closing under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively "Antitrust Laws"), to respond to any government requests for information under any Antitrust Law, and to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Antitrust Order") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. 

   

 (c) Each of the Company and the Buyer shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third party consents required in connection with the Merger that are (i) necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) disclosed or required to be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, or (iii) required to prevent the occurrence of an event that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect prior to or after the Effective Time, it being understood that neither the Company nor the Buyer shall be required to make materially burdensome payments in connection with the fulfillment of its obligations under this Section 6.6. 

   

 6.7 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by law or stock market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Company shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement. 

  

 6.8 _Indemnification_.

Each Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable law, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor. 

   

 (b) The Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Buyer shall cause the Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Articles of Organization and By-laws of the Company. 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). The Company or the Buyer may, prior to the Effective Time, satisfy the obligations of the Buyer under this Section 6.8(c) by purchasing a "tail" policy under the Companys current policies of the directors and officers liability insurance that has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time and that contains terms and conditions (including coverage amounts) that are no less advantageous than those applicable to the Indemnified Parties. 

   

 (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.8. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by law, charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives. 

   

 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is 

   ##### 

  

 

reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and the
Transitory Subsidiary or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to
such partys obligation to consummate the Merger. 

   

 6.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and the Buyer shall keep the other reasonably informed of any stockholder litigation or claim pending against the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, and its directors or officers, relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, further, that all obligations of the Company and the Buyer in this Section 6.10 shall be subject to the ability of such party under applicable laws to preserve attorney-client communication and privilege. 

  

 6.11 _Employee Compensation_. For a twelve-month period following the Effective Time, the Buyer will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide generally to those of its employees and employees of the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"), a total compensation package (including benefits) that, in the aggregate, is no less favorable to the total compensation package (including benefits) provided to those employees immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 6.12 _Service Credit_. Following the Effective Time, the Buyer will give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Buyer Employee Plans (as defined below), (b) determination of benefits levels under any Buyer Employee Plan or policy relating to vacation or severance and (c) determination of "retiree" status under any Buyer Employee Plan, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such crediting would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable plan of the Company and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Buyer Employee Plan" means any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, phantom stock, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement compensation and all unexpired severance agreements, for the benefit of, or relating to, any current or former employee of the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any entity that is a member of (A) a controlled group of corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), (B) a group of trades or businesses under common control (as defined in Section 414(c) of the Code) or (C) an affiliated service group (as defined in 

   ##### 

  

 

Section 414(m) of the Code or the regulations under Section 414(o) of the
Code), any of which includes or included the Buyer or a Subsidiary of the
Buyer. 

   

 6.13 _Notification to Company Option Holders_. Within ten (10) Business Days of the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall send a written notice to each holder of a Company Stock Option under a Company Stock Plan which informs such holder that the Company, through its Board of Directors, has determined that the Merger shall constitute a "Sale Event" under the terms of such Company Stock Plan, and informing such holder of the results of such determination.

 Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger service, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth. 

  

 9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms. 

  

 9.4 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 6.8 (with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party beneficiaries) and Sections 6.12 and 6.13 (with respect to which the Continuing Employees shall be third party beneficiaries), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto. 

  

 9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

  

 9.6 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission. 

  

 9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. The terms "material," "materially" or "materiality" as used in this Agreement with an initial lower case "m" are agreed to have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to Company Material Adverse Effect in Section 3.1 or Buyer Material Adverse Effect in Section 4.1. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 

  

 9.10 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. 

  

 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Boston, Massachusetts in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such 

   ##### 

  

 

action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to
bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing
in this Section 9.11, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by law. 

   

 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE TRANSITORY SUBSIDIARY OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT. 

  

 9.13 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in Article III, in the case of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or Article IV, in the case of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, and the disclosure in any Section shall qualify (a) the corresponding Section in Article III or Article IV, as the case may be, and (b) the other Sections in Article III or Article IV, as the case may be, to the extent that it is readily apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other Sections. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, or in any update thereto, shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the Ordinary Course of Business.

STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT 

   

 STOCKHOLDER VOTING AGREEMENT, dated as of August 18, 2005 (this "Agreement"), between the stockholder identified on the signature page hereto (the "Stockholder"), and EAS Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement referred to below. 

  

 WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, the Stockholder owns of record and beneficially shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and owns of record or beneficially options and other rights to acquire shares of common stock, of Brooktrout, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Company"), as set forth on the signature page hereto (such shares and options, or any other voting or equity securities of the Company hereafter acquired by any Stockholder prior to the termination of this Agreement, being referred to herein collectively as the "Shares"); 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer and the Company are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, a subsidiary of Buyer will be merged with and into the Company, and the Company will be the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); and 

  

 WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Buyer to enter into the Merger Agreement, Buyer has required that the Stockholder agree, and in order to induce Buyer to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Stockholder is willing to enter into this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereby agree, severally and not jointly, as follows: 

  

 Section 1\. _Voting of Shares_. 

  

 (a) The Stockholder covenants and agrees that until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, the Stockholder shall (a) appear at the Company Meeting or any other meeting of the stockholders of the Company, however called, or otherwise cause his, her or its Shares to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum, (b) vote in favor of any proposal to adjourn such meeting if necessary to permit the further solicitation of proxies in the event that there are not sufficient votes at the time of such meeting to approve the Merger Agreement, (c) vote, or cause to be voted, all of his, her or its Shares (i) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, and (ii) against approval of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. 

  

 (b) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 1(b), the Stockholder hereby irrevocably (to the extent permitted by law) grants to, and appoints, the Buyer as its proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in its name, place and stead, to vote his, her or its Shares, if the Stockholder is unable to perform his, her or its obligations under this Agreement, at any meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to any of the matters specified in, and solely in accordance and consistent with, Section 1(a). The Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this Section 1(b) is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the obligations of the Stockholder under this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided for herein, the Stockholder hereby affirms that the appointment of the proxy is coupled with an interest and intended to be irrevocable in accordance with the provisions of Section 7.22 of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the irrevocable proxy granted hereunder shall automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2\. _Transfer of Shares_. The Stockholder covenants and agrees that, prior to the conclusion of the Company Meeting, the Stockholder will not directly or indirectly (i) sell, assign, transfer, 

   ##### 

  

    

pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares, (ii) deposit any
of the Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or
arrangement with respect to the Shares or grant any proxy or power of
attorney with respect thereto which is inconsistent with this Agreement or
(iii) enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or undertaking with
respect to the direct or indirect sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition of any Shares prior to the conclusion of the Company Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder may make (i) transfers by
will, or by operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the
transferee, (ii) transfers in connection with estate and charitable planning
purposes, including transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable
organizations, subject to the transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by
the terms of, and perform the obligations of the Stockholder under, this
Agreement and (iii) as the Buyer may otherwise agree in writing. 

  

 Section 3\. _Representations and Warranties_. The Stockholder represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof as follows: 

  

 (a) _Ownership of Shares_. The Stockholder beneficially owns all of the Shares and options to acquire Shares as set forth on the signature page hereto. The Stockholder owns no shares of Company Common Stock other than the Shares as set forth on the signature page hereto. The Stockholder has sole voting power with respect to all of the Shares. 

  

 (b) _Power, Binding Agreement_. The Stockholder has the legal capacity and all requisite power and authority to enter into and perform all of its obligations under this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Stockholder and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. 

  

 (c) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Stockholder will not, conflict with or violate (i) any contract, agreement, license, instrument or permit to which the Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder is bound, or (ii) any law applicable to the Stockholder or by which the Stockholder is bound. Except as expressly contemplated hereby, the Stockholder is not a party to, and the Shares are not subject to or bound in any manner by, any contract or agreement relating to the Shares, including without limitation, any voting agreement, option agreement, purchase agreement, stockholders agreement, partnership agreement or voting trust. 

  

 (d) _No Restraints_. As of the date hereof, there is no suit, action investigation or proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the Stockholder before or by any governmental entity or person that could impair the ability of the Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on a timely basis 

  

 Section 4\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) any termination of the Merger Agreement. 

  

 Section 5\. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity. 

  

 Section 6\. _Fiduciary Duties_. The Stockholder is signing this Agreement solely in such Stockholders capacity as an owner of his, her or its respective Shares, and nothing herein shall prohibit, prevent or preclude such Stockholder from taking or not taking any action in his or her capacity as an officer or director of the Company, to the extent permitted by the Merger Agreement. Subject to the foregoing sentence, the Stockholder agrees, solely in his, her or its capacity as a Stockholder to comply with Section 6.1 of the Merger Agreement 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7\. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect thereto. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or rescinded except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties hereto. 

  

 (b) _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the terms of this Agreement remain as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
