AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   

 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 23, 2003 (this "Agreement"), is entered into by and among Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc., a federal corporation ("Parent"), SBU Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and majority owned subsidiary of Parent ("SBU Bank"), Wicked Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SBU Bank ("Newco"), Partners Trust, MHC, a federally-chartered mutual holding company ("MHC"), and BSB Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").  

 WHEREAS, each of Parent, SBU Bank, Newco, MHC and Company desire to consummate the business combination transaction as provided for in this Agreement, subject to and following the Conversion (as defined below), in which (i) Company will merge (the "Merger") with and into Newco, with Newco being the Surviving Corporation (as defined in _Section 1.1_), upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, and each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined in  _Section 2.1(b)_ hereof); (ii) immediately following the Merger, BSB Bank and Trust Company, a New York-chartered commercial bank and trust company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Company ("BSB Bank"), will merge with and into SBU Bank, with SBU Bank being the Surviving Bank (as defined in _Section 1.1(b)_);  

 WHEREAS, in connection with the Merger, it is intended that MHC will convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization pursuant to certain transactions (the "Conversion") as the result of which, _inter alia_ , SBU Bank will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco, and that in connection with such Conversion, Newco will conduct a subscription offering of its common stock, and if necessary a community and/or syndicated community offering, and an exchange offering to the existing public stockholders of Parent, all pursuant to a plan of conversion and reorganization, substantially in the Form attached at _Exhibit A_ hereto and subject to regulatory review and amendment in connection with such review as provided therein (the "Plan of Conversion");  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, SBU Bank, Newco and MHC (collectively, the "Parent Parties") and the Board of Directors of the Company have each approved this Agreement and the Merger in accordance with the provisions of applicable law, including without limitation, the rules and regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") and the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the "DGCL"), and have each determined that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders; and  

 WHEREAS, for Federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this Agreement be, and it hereby is, adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:   ##### 

 

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER   

 1.1 _The Merger_.  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Company shall be merged with and into Newco at the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.3_). Following the Effective Time, Newco shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of Company in accordance with the DGCL. Upon consummation of the Merger, the corporate existence of Company shall cease and the Surviving Corporation shall continue to exist as a Delaware corporation.   

 (b) Immediately following the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Bank Merger Agreement (as defined in _Section 5.3(c)_), and in accordance with applicable law, BSB Bank shall merge with and into SBU Bank, with SBU Bank being the surviving bank (hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Bank"). Upon consummation of the Bank Combination (as defined in  _Section 5.3_), the separate existence of BSB Bank shall cease and the Surviving Bank shall continue to exist as a federal savings bank.   

 1.2 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to closing contained in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place on the date of the closing of the Conversion (the "Closing Date"), immediately following the completion of the Conversion, unless another time or date is agreed to by the parties hereto.  

 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger in accordance with the DGCL (the "Certificate of Merger ") and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the parties shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time") filed by the parties with the Office of the Delaware Secretary of State.  

 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL.  

 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation_. The certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of Newco, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.  

 1.6 _Directors and Officers_.  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Newco shall consist of the directors of Newco in office immediately prior to the Effective Time _,_ together with three directors designated by Company (the "Company Designees"), one of whom shall be William Craine, who will also be appointed to serve as Chairman of Newcos Board of Directors, as provided in _Section 5.14_, and the remaining two of whom shall be non-management directors of Company as of the date hereof, until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of Newco. Each of the Company Designees shall be nominated and elected to serve in a class of directors of Newco whose terms expire not less than two years from the date of the Effective Time.     ##### 

    

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, except as provided in paragraph (a) of this _Section 1.6_ with respect to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the officers of Newco shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected, appointed or qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.   

 1.7 _Possible Alternative Structures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Parent or Newco shall be entitled to revise the structure of the Merger, the Bank Combination or the Conversion, provided that (i) there are no adverse federal or state income tax consequences to Company stockholders as a result of the modification; (ii) the consideration to be paid to the holders of Company Common Stock (as defined below) under this Agreement is not thereby changed in kind or value or reduced in amount as a result of such change in structure and, in the case of any revision to the structure of the Conversion, the pro forma capitalization of Newco (or the corporation issuing its capital stock to Company shareholders giving effect to such revision) shall not be materially different than that contemplated by the Plan of Conversion); and (iii) such modification will not materially delay or jeopardize receipt of any required regulatory approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the consummation of the Merger. Each of the parties hereto agree to appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to reflect any such revised structure.  

 1.8 _The Conversion_. Contemporaneous with the adoption of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of MHC is adopting the Plan of Conversion to convert into the capital stock form of organization. Newco is being organized to become the parent of SBU Bank and to offer for sale shares of common stock to the Participants (as defined in the Plan of Conversion) in the Conversion, based on the Independent Valuation (as defined in _Section 8.3_). The price per share of the shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of Newco (the "Newco Common Stock") to be issued in the Conversion is referred to as the "Conversion Price Per Share." The Conversion Price Per Share is expected to be $10.00. The shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger may be either shares unsubscribed for in the Conversion subscription or community offerings, or to the extent such shares are unavailable, authorized but unissued shares of Newco Common Stock, which shares shall be issued immediately following completion of the Conversion.  

ARTICLE II 
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK 
 OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; 
 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES   

 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:  

 (a) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock; Conversion of Share Owned by Subsidiaries_. Each share of Company capital stock (including the Company Common Stock) that is owned by Company (other than shares held in a fiduciary or agency capacity or in satisfaction of debts previously contracted) or by Newco shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by any Subsidiary (as defined in _Section 8.3_ ) of Company or Newco shall be converted into a number of shares of Newco Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined in _Section 2.1(b)(ii)_).   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled and retired or converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 2.6_)) shall be converted, at the election of the     ##### 

    

holder thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in _Section 2.4_
and subject to _Sections 2.2_ and _2.5_ , into the right to receive the
following, without interest:  

 (i) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive cash has been effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (a "Cash Election" and collectively, the "Cash Election Shares"), the right to receive in cash from Newco, without interest, the amount of $36.00 (the "Cash Consideration");   

 (ii) for each share of Company Common Stock with respect to which an election to receive Newco Common Stock has been effectively made and not revoked or lost, pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (a "Stock Election" and collectively, the "Stock Election Shares"), the right to receive from Newco 3.6 shares, or if the Conversion Price Per Share is not $10.00 then such other number of shares as is equal to 36 divided by the Conversion Price Per Share (the "Exchange Ratio"), of Newco Common Stock (the "Stock Consideration"); and   

 (iii) for each share of Company Common Stock other than shares as to which a Cash Election or a Stock Election has been effectively made and not revoked, pursuant to _Section 2.4_ (collectively, "Non-Election Shares"), the right to receive from Newco such Stock Consideration or Cash Consideration, as determined in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_. The Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the "Merger Consideration".   

For purposes of this Agreement, references to Company Common Stock shall
be deemed to include, where appropriate, references to the right to receive
shares of Company Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock pursuant to
the Rights Agreement, dated as of May 24, 1999, as amended between Company
and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company ("AST") (the "Company Rights
Agreement").  

 2.2 _Proration_.  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Stock Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)_ (the "Stock Conversion Number") shall be equal (subject to rounding in the discretion of Newco) to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) .60, _it being understood_ that all of the other shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into Cash Consideration (in each case, excluding shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ and Dissenting Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event counsel for Newco reasonably determines that the Merger may not satisfy the continuity of interest requirements applicable to reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, Newco shall reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Cash Consideration and correspondingly increase the number of shares of Company Common Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration by the minimum amount necessary to enable the Merger to satisfy such continuity of interest requirements.   

 (b) Within five business days after the Effective Time (as defined in  _Section 1.3_), Newco shall cause the Exchange Agent (as defined in _Section 2.4_) to effect among holders of Company Common Stock the allocation of rights to receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:   

 (i) If the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which Stock Elections shall have been made (the "Stock Election Number") exceeds the Stock Conversion Number, then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and Stock Election Shares     ##### 

    

of each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Stock Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Stock
Conversion Number and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number,
with the remaining number of such holders Stock Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; and  

 (ii) If the Stock Election Number is less than the Stock Conversion Number (the amount by which the Stock Conversion Number exceeds the Stock Election Number being referred to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and the Non-Election Shares and Cash Election Shares shall be treated in the following manner:   

 (A) If the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and the Non-Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration; or   

 (B) If the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares, then all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration and Cash Election Shares of each holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Stock Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total number of Non-Election Shares and the denominator of which is the total number of Cash Election Shares, with the remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration.   

 2.3 _Company Stock Options_. (a) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option (as defined in _Section 3.1(c)_) representing a right to receive Company Common Stock upon exercise of such Company Stock Option outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive from Newco replacement stock options in accordance with this _Section 2.3_: At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Newco Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of Companys 1996 Long Term Incentive and Capital Accumulation Plan, as amended, or the Directors Stock Option Plan, as applicable, and the stock option agreements granted thereunder (the "Company Option Plans"));  

 (i) The number of shares of Newco Common Stock to be subject to the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the option immediately before the Effective Time, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares of Newco Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest share; and   

 (ii) The exercise price per share of Newco Common Stock under the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the option immediately before the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest cent.     ##### 

    

The adjustment provided herein shall be and is intended to be effected in
a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration
and other terms of the option immediately after the Effective Time shall be
the same as the corresponding terms in effect immediately before the
Effective Time, except that all references to Company or BSB Bank in the
Company Stock Plan (and the corresponding references in the option agreement
documenting such option) shall be deemed to be references to Newco or SBU
Bank. Nothing herein shall be construed as preventing option or warrant
holders from exercising the same prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms thereof.  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take any and all actions necessary to effectuate this _Section 2.3_. Parent, Newco or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall take, or shall cause to be taken, the necessary action to reserve and continue to reserve adequate shares of Newco Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of any converted options. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent, Newco or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall file, or shall cause to be filed, a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms), with respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock subject to converted options and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain, or shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be maintained, the effectiveness of such registration statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such converted options remain outstanding.   

 2.4 _Election and Exchange Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) ("Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article II, to submit an election in accordance with the following procedures:  

 (a) Each Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.4_ (herein called an "Election") (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Stock Election, in which case such Holder shall be deemed to have made a Stock Election with respect to such shares and a Cash Election with respect to the balance, or (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which such Holder desires to make a Cash Election, in which case such Holder shall be deemed to have made a Cash Election with respect to such shares and a Stock Election with respect to the balance.   

 (b) Newco shall prepare an election form reasonably acceptable to Company (the "Form of Election") which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificate(s) (as defined below) theretofore representing Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to such bank or trust company designated by Newco and reasonably satisfactory to Company (the "Exchange Agent"). The Election Form shall be mailed to Companys stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting of the stockholders of Company at which the stockholders of Company consider and vote on this Agreement (the "Company Stockholders Meeting") so as to permit Companys stockholders to exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in _Section 2.4(d)_).   

 (c) Newco shall mail the Form of Election on or about the time that the Proxy Statement (as defined herein) is mailed to the stockholders of Company, to such stockholders, and shall use all reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as possible a Form of Election to any stockholder of Company who requests such Form of Election following the initial mailing of the Forms of Election and prior to the Election Deadline. In no event shall the Form of Election be made available less than 20 business days prior to the Election Deadline.   

 (d) Any Election shall have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by 5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such Exchange Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of Election properly completed and signed and     ##### 

    

accompanied by certificates of the shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Company Stock Certificates") to which such Form of Election relates or by an
appropriate customary guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from a member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank or trust company in the United
States; _provided_ , that such certificates are in fact delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of delivery. Failure to
deliver shares of Company Stock Certificates covered by such a guarantee of
delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless otherwise determined
by Newco, in its sole discretion. As used herein, "Election Deadline" means
5:00 p.m. on the date that, as reasonably determined by Newco, is as close as
possible to the fifth business day prior to date on which the Effective Time
occurs. Company and Newco shall cooperate to issue a press release reasonably
satisfactory to each of them announcing the date of the Election Deadline not
more than 10 business days before, and at least five business days prior to,
the Election Deadline.  

 (e) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, change or revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and signed, revised Form of Election. If Newco shall determine in its reasonable discretion that any Election is not properly made with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock, such Election shall be deemed to be not in effect, and the shares of Company Common Stock covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely made.   

 (f) Any Company stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election Deadline, revoke his, her or its Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his or her Company Stock Certificate or of the guarantee of delivery of such certificates previously deposited with the Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by Newco or Company, upon exercise by Newco or Company of its respective or their mutual rights to terminate this Agreement to the extent provided under Article VII, that this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Article VII.   

 (g) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name a Company Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Company Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Taxes (as defined in _Section 3.1(j)(xvii)_) required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company Stock Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Time, Newco) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration (including cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent or Newco, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Newco, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Newco, as the case may be.   

 (h) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration or transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

 (i) At any time following the twelve-month anniversary of the Effective Time, Newco shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Newco any remaining portion of the Merger Consideration not distributed to Holders of shares of Company Common Stock that was deposited with the Exchange Agent at the Effective Time (the "Exchange Fund") (including any interest received with respect thereto and other income resulting from investments by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Newco), and Holders shall be entitled to look only to Newco (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to Newco Common Stock payable upon due surrender of their Company Stock Certificates, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Newco nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Holder of a Company Stock Certificate for Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   

 (j) In the event any Company Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Newco or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such sum as Newco may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate(s), the Exchange Agent will issue the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificates.   

 (k) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Newco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Newco Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (l) below, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock shall be paid by Newco to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with subsection (l) below. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender of any such Company Stock Certificate there shall be paid to the holder of a certificate for Newco Common Stock (a "Newco Stock Certificate") representing whole shares of Newco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Newco Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Newco Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to subsection (l), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Newco Common Stock. Newco shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes, if necessary.   

 (l) No Newco Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of Newco Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company Stock Certificates; no dividend or distribution by Newco shall relate to such fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of Newco. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each Holder of a Company Stock Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share interest in exchange for such Company Stock Certificate shall receive from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash determined by multiplying the price for which the Newco Common Stock is sold in the Exchange Offering by the fraction of a share of Newco Common Stock which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(b)(ii)_ above. No interest will be paid on the cash that the Holders of such fractional shares shall be entitled to receive upon such delivery.     ##### 

    

 (m) Newco, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (A) the validity of the Forms of Election and compliance by any stockholder of Company with the Election procedures set forth herein, (B) the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into account in making the determinations prescribed by _Section 2.4_, (C) the issuance and delivery of Newco Stock Certificates into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (D) the method of payment of cash for shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Newco Common Stock.   

 (n) Prior to the Effective Time, Newco will deposit with the Exchange Agent certificates representing shares of Newco Common Stock sufficient to pay in a timely manner, and Newco shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Stock Consideration. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, Newco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent sufficient cash to permit prompt payment of the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock, and Newco shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock where the holder of the applicable Company Stock Certificate has no right to receive whole shares of Newco Common Stock.   

 (o) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any case within 10 business days, after the Effective Time, Newco shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor who did not complete an Election Form, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Company Stock Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon delivery of Company Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such certificates)) (the "Letter of Transmittal") to the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be determined by Newco and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Company Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.4(k)_ and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(j)_.   

 (p) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Company Stock Certificate(s), accompanied by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (elected or deemed elected by the Holder, subject to _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ) in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by the Holders Company Stock Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such Company Stock Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Newco Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with  _Section 2.4(l)_ and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(k)_.   

 2.5 _Certain Adjustments._ If after the date hereof and on or prior to the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Newco Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization or combination, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall occur (any such event, a "Newco Adjustment Event"), the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such Newco Adjustment Event.  

 2.6 _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to   ##### 

 

the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who
has properly exercised appraisal rights under the DGCL (the "Dissenting
Shares ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration unless and until the holder shall have failed to perfect, or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, the right to dissent from
the Merger under the DGCL and to receive such consideration as may be
determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and
subject to the requirements of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have so
failed to perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such right after the
Election Deadline, each share of such holders Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as of the
Effective Time, the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Stock
Election Consideration or the Cash Election Consideration, or a combination
thereof, as determined by Newco, in its sole discretion. Company shall give
Newco (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for
shares of Company Common Stock received by Company and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demands or notices. Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Newco, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands.

No Company Title IV Plan or any trust established thereunder has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA of Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal year, except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.   

 (ix) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for benefits), except for claims which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company.   

 (x) No Company Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan.

Each of Company and its Subsidiaries has good title free and clear of all Liens to all Owned Properties, except for Company Permitted Liens.   

 (ii) _Section 3.1(y)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each agreement pursuant to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases any real property (such agreements, together with any amendments, modifications and other supplements thereto, collectively, the "Leases"), other than the Leases for which the subject property is identified in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002 filed by Company with the SEC on March 28, 2003.

There are no defaults by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, under any of the Leases, which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Leases and a Material Adverse Effect on Company. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause defaults under the Leases, except for any such default that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company.   

 (iii) The Owned Properties and the properties leased pursuant to the Leases (the "Leased Properties") constitute all of the real estate on which Company and its Subsidiaries maintain their facilities or conduct their business as of the date of this Agreement, except for locations the loss of which would not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Company. The Owned Properties and the Leased Properties are in compliance with all laws, except where non-compliance would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Neither any agreement relating to the Owned Properties nor any of the Leases requires consent of any third party for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby except for (i) such consents which will be obtained prior to Closing and are listed in _Section 3.1(y)(iii)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule or (ii) such consents the failure of which to obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company.

To the knowledge of Company, there are no existing defaults by the tenant under any Third Party Lease, which, in the aggregate, would result in the termination of such Third Party Leases except for any such default that would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not cause     ##### 

    

defaults under the Third Party Leases, except for any such default
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on Company.  

 (z) _Administration of Accounts_. Company and each of its Subsidiaries has properly administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary or agent, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law, except where the failure to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their directors, officers, agents or Employees, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary or agency account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary or agency account, except for such breaches and failures to be true, correct and accurate which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Company.   

 (aa) _Internal Controls_. None of Company or its Subsidiaries records, systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not) which (including all means of access thereto and therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of it or its Subsidiaries or accountants except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a materially adverse effect on the system of internal accounting controls described in the next sentence. Company and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.   

 (bb) _Reserves for Losses_. All reserves or other allowances for possible losses reflected in Companys financial statements referred to in _Section 3.1(e)_ as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September 30, 2003, as of the dates of such financial statements complied with the standards established by applicable Governmental Entities and were adequate under GAAP. Neither Company nor BSB Bank has been notified by the Federal Reserve, NYSBD, the FDIC or Companys independent auditor, in writing or otherwise, that such reserves are inadequate or that the practices and policies of Company or BSB Bank, as the case may be, in establishing its reserves for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September 30, 2003, and in accounting for delinquent and classified assets generally fail to comply with applicable accounting or regulatory requirements, or that the Federal Reserve, NYSBD, the FDIC or Companys independent auditor believes such reserves to be inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of Company. Company has previously furnished Newco with a complete list of all extensions of credit and other real estate owned ("OREO") that have been classified by any bank or trust examiner (regulatory or internal) as other loans specially mentioned, special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss, classified or criticized, credit risk assets, concerned loans or words of similar import. Company agrees to update such list at the request of Parent (but no more frequently than monthly) after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. All OREO held by Company is being carried net of reserves at the lower of cost or net realizable value.

There is no labor strike, labor dispute (other than routine Employee grievances that are not related to union Employees), work slowdown, stoppage or lockout pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against any Parent Party. There is no unfair labor practice or labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened against any Parent Party (other than routine Employee grievances that are not related to union Employees) which would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The Parent Parties are in compliance with all applicable laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and are not engaged in any unfair labor practice, except insofar as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   

 (p) _Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments_. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, all Derivative Transactions entered into by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries were entered into in accordance with applicable rules, regulations and policies of all regulatory authorities, and in accordance with the investment, securities, commodities, risk management and other Policies, Practices and Procedures employed by such Parent Party, and were entered into with counter-parties believed at the time to be financially responsible and able to understand (either alone or in consultation with their advisers) and to bear the risks of such Derivative Transactions; and each such Parent Party has duly performed their obligations under the Derivative Transactions to the extent that such obligations to perform have accrued, and, to such Parent Partys knowledge, there are no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of such by any party thereunder.

 (ii) All loans owned by any of the Parent Parties, or in which any of the Parent Parties has an interest, have been made or acquired by Parent in accordance with board of director-approved loan policies. As of the date hereof, each of the Parent Parties holds mortgages contained in its loan portfolio for its own benefit to the extent of its interest shown therein; such mortgages evidence liens having the priority indicated by the terms of such mortgages, including the associated loan documents, subject, as of the date of recordation or filing of applicable security instruments, only to such exceptions as are discussed in attorneys opinions regarding title or in title insurance policies in the mortgage files relating to the loans secured by real property or are not material as to the collectability of such loans; and all loans owned by each of the Parent Parties are with full recourse to the borrowers, and each of the Parent Parties has taken no action which would result in a waiver or negation of any rights or remedies available against the borrower or guarantor, if any, on any loan. All applicable remedies against all borrowers and guarantors are enforceable except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar applicable laws affecting creditors rights and except as may be limited by the exercise of judicial discretion in applying principles of equity. All loans purchased or originated by any of the Parent Parties and subsequently sold by any of the Parent Parties have been sold without recourse to any of the Parent Parties and without any liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation. True, correct and complete copies of loan delinquency reports as of September 30, 2003 prepared by each of the Parent Parties, which reports include all loans delinquent or otherwise in default, have been furnished to Company. True, correct and complete copies of the currently effective lending policies and practices of each of the Parent Parties also have been furnished or made available to Company.

None of the Parent Parties, nor any of their directors, officers, agents or Employees, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary or agency account, and the accountings for each such fiduciary or agency account are true and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary or agency account, except for such breaches and failures to be true, correct and accurate which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.   

 (s) _Reserves for Losses_. All reserves or other allowances for possible losses reflected in Parents financial statements referred to in  _Section 3.2(d)_ as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September 30, 2003, as of the date of such financial statements, complied with the standards established by applicable Governmental Entities and were adequate under GAAP. Parent has not been notified by the OTS, the FDIC or Parents independent auditor, in writing or otherwise, that such reserves are inadequate or that the practices and policies of Parent in establishing its reserves for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the quarter ended September 30, 2003 and in accounting for delinquent and classified assets generally fail to comply with applicable accounting or regulatory requirements, or that the OTS, the FDIC or Parents independent auditor believes such reserves to be inadequate or inconsistent with the historical loss experience of Parent. Parent has made available to Company a true and complete list of all extensions of credit and OREO that have been classified by any bank or trust examiner (regulatory or internal) as other loans specially mentioned, special mention, substandard, doubtful, loss, classified or criticized, credit risk assets, concerned loans or words of similar import.

 5.4 _Rule 16B-3 Actions._ Newco and Company agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain Company Insiders (as defined below) in connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in connection with the conversion of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options in connection with the Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this _Section 5.4_.

PLAN OF CONVERSION AND REORGANIZATION OF PARTNERS TRUST, MHC   

    1.  |   | INTRODUCTION  
---|---|--- 
  

 This Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the "Plan") provides for the conversion of Partners Trust, MHC, a federal mutual holding company (the "Mutual Holding Company"), into the capital stock form of organization. The Mutual Holding Company currently owns a majority of the common stock of Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc., a federally chartered stock corporation (the "Mid-Tier Holding Company") that owns 100% of the common stock of SBU Bank, a federally chartered savings bank that is headquartered in Utica, New York. A new Delaware stock holding company (the "Holding Company") will be established as part of the Conversion and will succeed to all the rights and obligations of the Mutual Holding Company and issue Holding Company Common Stock in the Conversion and Merger. The purpose of the Conversion is to convert the Mutual Holding Company to the capital stock form of organization. The Holding Company will offer its Common Stock in the Offering upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. The subscription rights granted to participants in the Subscription Offering are set forth in Sections 8 through 11 hereof. All sales of Holding Company Common Stock in the Community Offering, Syndicated Community Offering or Underwritten Public Offering will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors of the Bank and the Holding Company. As part of the Conversion and the Exchange Offering, each Minority Stockholder will receive Holding Company Common Stock in exchange for Minority Shares. The Conversion will have no impact on depositors, borrowers or customers of the Bank. After the Conversion, the Banks insured deposits will continue to be insured by the FDIC to the extent provided by applicable law.   

This Plan has been adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Mutual
Holding Company, Mid-Tier Holding Company and the Bank. This Plan must also
be approved by (i) a majority of the total number of votes entitled to be
cast by Voting Depositors at a Special Meeting of Depositors to be called for
that purpose, and (ii) at least two-thirds of the outstanding common stock of
the Mid-Tier Holding Company at the Special Meeting of Stockholders,
including at least a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, by
Minority Stockholders. The OTS must approve this Plan before it is presented
to Voting Depositors and stockholders of the Mid-Tier Holding Company for
their approval.

    3.  |   | PROCEDURES FOR CONVERSION  
---|---|--- 
  

 A. After approval of the Plan by the Board of Directors of the Bank and the Board of Directors of the Mutual Holding Company, the Plan together with all other requisite material shall be submitted to the OTS for approval. Notice of the adoption of the Plan by the Board of Directors of the Bank and the Board of Directors of the Mutual Holding Company and the submission of the Plan to the OTS for approval will be published in a newspaper having general circulation in each community in which an office of the Bank is located, and copies of the Plan will be made available at each office of     ##### 

    

the Bank for inspection by depositors. The Mutual Holding Company also
will publish a notice of the filing with the OTS of an application to convert
in accordance with the provisions of the Plan.  

 B. Promptly following approval by the OTS, the Plan will be submitted to a vote of (i) Voting Depositors at the Special Meeting of Depositors, and (ii) the Stockholders of the Mid-Tier Holding Company at the Special Meeting of Stockholders. The Mutual Holding Company will mail to all Voting Depositors, at their last known address appearing on the records of the Bank, a proxy statement in either long or summary form describing the Plan, which will be submitted to a vote of Voting Depositors at the Special Meeting of Depositors. The Holding Company also will mail to all Participants either a Prospectus and Order Form for the purchase of Subscription Shares or a letter informing them of their right to receive a Prospectus and Order Form and a postage prepaid card to request such materials, subject to other provisions of this Plan. In addition, all Participants will receive, or be given the opportunity to request by either returning a postage prepaid card which will be distributed with the proxy statement or by letter addressed to the Banks Secretary, a copy of the Plan as well as the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the Holding Company. Upon approval of the Plan by at least (i) a majority of the total number of votes entitled to be cast by Voting Depositors, (ii) two-thirds of the outstanding common stock of the Mid-Tier Holding Company, and (iii) a majority vote of Minority Stockholders present in person or by proxy, the Mutual Holding Company, the Holding Company and the Bank will take all other necessary steps pursuant to applicable laws and regulations to consummate the Conversion and Offering. The Conversion must be completed within 24 months of the approval of the Plan by Voting Depositors, unless a longer time period is permitted by governing laws and regulations.   

 C. The Conversion will be effected as follows, or in any other manner that is consistent with the purposes of this Plan and applicable laws and regulations, including a merger of the Mutual Holding Company into the Mid-Tier Holding Company followed immediately by the Offering. The choice of which method to use to effect the Conversion will be made by the Board of Directors of the Mutual Holding Company immediately prior to the closing of the Conversion. Each of the steps set forth below shall be deemed to occur in such order as is necessary to consummate the Conversion pursuant to the Plan, the intent of the Board of Directors of the Mutual Holding Company and the Board of Directors of the Bank, and applicable federal and state regulations and policy. Approval of the Plan by Voting Depositors and stockholders of the Mid-Tier Holding Company also shall constitute approval of each of the transactions necessary to implement the Plan.   

 (1) The Bank will establish the Holding Company as a first-tier Delaware-chartered stock holding company subsidiary.   

 (2) Holding Company will charter Interim.   

 (3) The Mid-Tier Holding Company will convert to an interim stock savings bank (which shall continue to be referred to as the "Mid-Tier Holding Company") and merge with and into the Bank (the "Mid-Tier Merger") with the Bank as the resulting entity pursuant to the Agreement of Merger attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ between the Mid-Tier Holding Company and the Bank, whereby the Mutual Holding Company will receive, and Minority Stockholders will constructively receive, shares of Bank common stock in exchange for their Mid-Tier Holding Company common stock.   

 (4) Contemporaneously with the Mid-Tier Merger, the Mutual Holding Company will convert to an interim stock savings bank and will merge with and into the Bank (the "MHC Merger") pursuant to the Agreement of Merger attached hereto as  _Exhibit B_ between the Mutual Holding Company and the Bank, whereby the shares of Bank common stock held by the Mutual Holding Company will be canceled and each Eligible Account Holder and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder will receive an interest in a Liquidation Account of the Bank in exchange for such persons interest in the Mutual Holding Company.     ##### 

    

 (5) Immediately after the MHC Merger and the Mid-Tier Merger, Interim will merge with and into the Bank with the Bank as the surviving entity (the "Bank Merger") pursuant to the Agreement of Merger between the Bank and Interim attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. Constructive shareholders of the Bank (i.e., Minority Stockholders immediately prior to the Conversion) will exchange the shares of Bank common stock that they constructively received in the Mid-Tier Merger for Holding Company Common Stock.   

 (6) Immediately after the Bank Merger, the Holding Company will sell the Subscription Shares in the Offering.   

 D. As part of the Conversion, each of the Minority Shares shall automatically, without further action of the holder thereof, be converted into and become the right to receive Holding Company Common Stock based upon the Exchange Ratio. The basis for exchange of Minority Shares for Holding Company Common Stock shall be fair and reasonable. Options to purchase shares of Mid-Tier Holding Company common stock which are outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Conversion shall be converted into options to purchase shares of Holding Company Common Stock, with the number of shares subject to the option and the exercise price per share to be adjusted based upon the Exchange Ratio so that the aggregate exercise price remains unchanged, and with the duration of the option remaining unchanged.   

 E. The Holding Company shall register the Conversion Stock with the SEC and any appropriate state securities authorities. In addition, the Mid-Tier Holding Company shall prepare preliminary proxy materials as well as other applications and information for review by the SEC in connection with the solicitation of stockholder approval of the Plan.   

 F. All assets, rights, interests, privileges, powers, franchises and property (real, personal and mixed) of the Mid-Tier Holding Company shall be automatically transferred to and vested in the Holding Company by virtue of the Conversion without any deed or other document of transfer. The Holding Company, without any order or action on the part of any court or otherwise and without any documents of assumption or assignment, shall hold and enjoy all of the properties, franchises and interests, including appointments, powers, designations, nominations and all other rights and interests as the agent or other fiduciary in the same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises, and interests and powers were held or enjoyed by the Mid-Tier Holding Company. The Holding Company shall be responsible for all of the liabilities, restrictions and duties of every kind and description of the Mid-Tier Holding Company immediately prior to the Conversion, including liabilities for all debts, obligations and contracts of the Mid-Tier Holding Company, matured or unmatured, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise and whether or not reflected or reserved against on balance sheets, books or accounts or records of the Mid-Tier Holding Company.   

 G. The Certificate of Incorporation of the Holding Company (the "Certificate") shall read in the form of _Exhibit D_.   

 H. The home office and branch offices of the Bank shall be unaffected by the Conversion. The executive offices of the Holding Company shall be located at the current offices of the Mutual Holding Company and Mid-Tier Holding Company.     ##### 

    

    4.  |   | HOLDING COMPANY APPLICATIONS AND APPROVALS  
---|---|--- 
  

 The Board of Directors of the Mutual Holding Company, the Holding Company and the Bank will take all necessary steps to convert the Mutual Holding Company to stock form, form the Holding Company and complete the Offering. The Holding Company shall make timely applications to the OTS for any requisite regulatory approvals to complete the Conversion.   

    5.  |   | SALE OF SUBSCRIPTION SHARES  
---|---|--- 
  

 The Subscription Shares will be offered simultaneously in the Subscription Offering to the Participants in the respective priorities set forth in this Plan. The Subscription Offering may begin as early as the mailing of the Proxy Statement for the Special Meeting of Depositors. The Holding Company Common Stock will not be insured by the FDIC. The Bank will not knowingly lend funds or otherwise extend credit to any Person to purchase shares of Holding Company Common Stock.   

 Any shares of Holding Company Common Stock for which subscriptions have not been received in the Subscription Offering may be issued in the Community Offering. The Subscription Offering may begin prior to the Special Meeting of Depositors and, in that event, the Community Offering also may begin prior to the Special Meeting of Depositors. The offer and sale of Holding Company Common Stock prior to the Special Meeting of Depositors, however, is subject to the approval of the Plan by Voting Depositors and stockholders of the Mid-Tier Holding Company.   

 If feasible, any shares of Holding Company Common Stock remaining after the Subscription Offering, and the Community Offering should one be conducted, will be sold in a Syndicated Community Offering or Underwritten Public Offering, or in any manner that will achieve the widest distribution of the Holding Company Common Stock. The Syndicated Community Offering and/or Underwritten Public Offering may be conducted in addition to, or instead of, a Community Offering. The issuance of Holding Company Common Stock in any Subscription Offering and any Community Offering will be consummated simultaneously on the date the sale of Holding Company Common Stock in the Syndicated Community Offering or Underwritten Public Offering is consummated and only if the required minimum number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock has been issued.   

    6.  |   | PURCHASE PRICE AND NUMBER OF SUBSCRIPTION SHARES  
---|---|--- 
  

 The total number of shares (or a range thereof) of Conversion Stock to be offered in the Conversion will be determined jointly by the Boards of Directors of the Mutual Holding Company, the Mid-Tier Holding Company and the Holding Company immediately prior to the commencement of the Subscription and Community Offerings, and will be based on the Appraised Value Range and the Subscription Price. The Offering Range will be equal to the Appraised Value Range multiplied by the Majority Ownership Percentage. The estimated pro forma consolidated market value of the Holding Company will be subject to adjustment within the Appraised Value Range if necessitated by market or financial conditions, with the receipt of any required approvals of the OTS, and the maximum of the Appraised Value Range may be increased by up to 15% subsequent to the commencement of the Subscription Offering to reflect changes in market and financial conditions or demand for the shares. The number of shares of Conversion Stock issued in the Conversion will be equal to the estimated pro forma consolidated market value of the Holding Company, as may be amended, divided by the Subscription Price, and the number of Subscription Shares issued in the Offering will be equal to the product of (i) the estimated pro forma consolidated market value of the Holding Company, as may be amended, divided by the Subscription Price, and (ii) the Majority Ownership Interest.   

 In the event that the Subscription Price multiplied by the number of shares of Conversion Stock to be issued in the Conversion is below the minimum of the Appraised Value Range, or materially above the maximum of the Appraised Value Range, a resolicitation of purchasers may be     ##### 

    

 required, provided that up to a 15% increase above the maximum of the
Appraised Value Range will not be deemed material so as to require a
resolicitation. Any such resolicitation shall be effected in such manner and
within such time as the Bank and the Mutual Holding Company shall establish,
if all required regulatory approvals are obtained.  

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares of Conversion Stock will not be issued unless, prior to the consummation of the Conversion, the Independent Appraiser confirms to the Bank, the Mutual Holding Company, the Holding Company, and the OTS, that, to the best knowledge of the Independent Appraiser, nothing of a material nature has occurred which, taking into account all relevant factors, would cause the Independent Appraiser to conclude that the number of shares of Conversion Stock issued in the Conversion multiplied by the Subscription Price is incompatible with its estimate of the aggregate consolidated pro forma market value of the Holding Company. If such confirmation is not received, the Holding Company may cancel the Offering, extend the Conversion and establish a new Subscription Price and/or Appraised Value Range, extend, reopen or hold a new Offering, or take such other action as the OTS may permit.   

 The Holding Company Common Stock to be issued in the Conversion shall be fully paid and nonassessable.   

    7.  |   | RETENTION OF CONVERSION PROCEEDS BY THE HOLDING COMPANY  
---|---|--- 
  

 The Holding Company may retain substantially all of the proceeds of the Offering. The Holding Company believes that the Offering proceeds will provide economic strength to the Holding Company and the Bank for the future in a highly competitive and regulated financial services environment and would facilitate the continued expansion through acquisitions of financial service organizations, continued diversification into other related businesses and for other business and investment purposes, including the possible payment of dividends and possible future repurchases of the Holding Company Common Stock as permitted by applicable federal and state regulations and policy.   

    8.  |   | SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS OF ELIGIBLE ACCOUNT HOLDERS (FIRST
PRIORITY)  
---|---|--- 
  

 A. Each Eligible Account Holder shall have nontransferable subscription rights to subscribe for in the Subscription Offering up to the greater of 100,000 shares of Holding Company Common Stock, 0.10% of the total number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock issued in the Offering, or fifteen times the product (rounded down to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying the number of Subscription Shares offered in the Offering by a fraction of which the numerator is the amount of the Eligible Account Holders Qualifying Deposit and the denominator is the total amount of Qualifying Deposits of all Eligible Account Holders, in each case on the Eligibility Record Date, subject to the provisions of Section 14.   

 B. In the event that Eligible Account Holders exercise subscription rights for a number of Subscription Shares in excess of the total number of such shares eligible for subscription, the Subscription Shares shall be allocated among the subscribing Eligible Account Holders so as to permit each subscribing Eligible Account Holder to purchase a number of shares sufficient to make his or her total allocation of Subscription Shares equal to the lesser of 100 shares or the number of shares for which such Eligible Account Holder has subscribed. Any remaining shares will be allocated among the subscribing Eligible Account Holders whose subscriptions remain unsatisfied in the proportion that the amount of the Qualifying Deposit of each Eligible Account Holder whose subscription remains unsatisfied bears to the total amount of the Qualifying Deposits of all Eligible Account Holders whose subscriptions remain unsatisfied. If the amount so allocated exceeds the amount subscribed for by any one or more Eligible Account Holders, the excess shall be reallocated (one or more times as necessary)     ##### 

    

among those Eligible Account Holders whose subscriptions are still not
fully satisfied on the same principle until all available shares have been
allocated.  

 C. Subscription rights as Eligible Account Holders received by Directors and Officers and their Associates which are based on deposits made by such persons during the 12 months preceding the Eligibility Record Date shall be subordinated to the subscription rights of all other Eligible Account Holders.   

    9.  |   | SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEE PLANS (SECOND PRIORITY)  
---|---|--- 
  

 The Employee Plans of the Holding Company and the Banks shall have subscription rights to purchase in the aggregate up to 10% of the Subscription Shares issued in the Offering, including any Subscription Shares to be issued as a result of an increase in the maximum of the Offering Range after commencement of the Subscription Offering and prior to completion of the Conversion. Consistent with applicable laws and regulations and practices and policies, the Employee Plans may use funds contributed by the Holding Company or the Banks and/or borrowed from an independent financial institution to exercise such subscription rights, and the Holding Company and the Banks may make scheduled discretionary contributions thereto, provided that such contributions do not cause the Holding Company or the Banks to fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirements. The Employee Plans shall not be deemed to be Associates or Affiliates of or Persons Acting in Concert with any Director or Officer of the Holding Company or the Banks. Alternatively, if permitted by the OTS, the Employee Plans may purchase all or a portion of such shares in the open market.   

    10.  |   | SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS OF SUPPLEMENTAL ELIGIBLE ACCOUNT
HOLDERS (THIRD PRIORITY)  
---|---|--- 
  

 A. Each Supplemental Eligible Account Holder shall have nontransferable subscription rights to subscribe for in the Subscription Offering up to the greater of 100,000 shares of Holding Company Common Stock, 0.10% of the total number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock issued in the Offering, or fifteen times the product (rounded down to the next whole number) obtained by multiplying the number of shares Subscription Shares offered in the Offering by a fraction of which the numerator is the amount of the Supplemental Eligible Account Holders Qualifying Deposit and the denominator is the total amount of Qualifying Deposits of all Supplemental Eligible Account Holders, in each case on the Supplemental Eligibility Record Date, subject to the availability of sufficient shares after filling in full all subscription orders of the Eligible Account Holders and Employee Plans and to the purchase limitations specified in Section 14.   

 B. In the event that Supplemental Eligible Account Holders exercise subscription rights for a number of Subscription Shares in excess of the total number of such shares eligible for subscription, the Subscription Shares shall be allocated among the subscribing Supplemental Eligible Account Holders so as to permit each such subscribing Supplemental Eligible Account Holder, to the extent possible, to purchase a number of shares sufficient to make his or her total allocation of Subscription Shares equal to the lesser of 100 shares or the number of shares for which each such Supplemental Eligible Account Holder has subscribed. Any remaining shares will be allocated among the subscribing Supplemental Eligible Account Holders whose subscriptions remain unsatisfied in the proportion that the amount of the Qualifying Deposit of each such Supplemental Eligible Account Holder bears to the total amount of the Qualifying Deposits of all Supplemental Eligible Account Holders whose subscriptions remain unsatisfied. If the amount so allocated exceeds the amount subscribed for by any one or more Supplemental Eligible Account Holders, the excess shall be reallocated (one or more times as necessary) among those Supplemental Eligible Account Holders whose subscriptions are still not fully satisfied on the same principle until all available shares have been allocated.     ##### 

    

    11.  |   | SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS OF OTHER DEPOSITORS (FOURTH
PRIORITY)  
---|---|--- 
  

 A. Each Other Depositor shall have nontransferable subscription rights to subscribe for in the Subscription Offering up to 100,000 shares of Holding Company Common Stock subject to the availability of sufficient shares after filling in full all subscription orders of Eligible Account Holders, Employee Plans and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders and to the purchase limitations specified in Section 14.   

 B. In the event that such Other Depositors subscribe for a number of Subscription Shares which, when added to the Subscription Shares subscribed for by the Eligible Account Holders, Employee Plans and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders, is in excess of the total number of Subscription Shares to be issued, the available shares will be allocated to Other Depositors so as to permit each such subscribing Other Depositor, to the extent possible, to purchase a number of shares sufficient to make his or her total allocation of Subscription Shares equal to the lesser of 100 shares or the number of shares for which each such Other Depositor has subscribed. Any remaining shares will be allocated among the subscribing Other Depositors whose subscriptions remain unsatisfied in the proportion that the amount of the Qualifying Deposit of each such Other Depositor bears to the total amount of the Qualifying Deposits of all Other Depositor whose subscriptions remain unsatisfied.   

    12.  |   | COMMUNITY OFFERING AND MERGER SHARES  
---|---|--- 
  

 A. If subscriptions are not received for all Subscription Shares offered for sale in the Subscription Offering, shares for which subscriptions have not been received may be issued for sale in the Community Offering through a direct community marketing program which may use a broker, dealer, consultant or investment banking firm experienced and expert in the sale of savings institutions securities. Such entities may be compensated on a fixed fee basis or on a commission basis, or a combination thereof. In the event orders for Holding Company Common Stock in the Community Offering exceed the number of shares available for sale, shares shall be allocated (to the extent shares remain available) first to cover orders of Minority Stockholders as of the Voting Record Date, next to cover orders of any Person who holds a Deposit Account at the Acquiree Bank on November 30, 2003 and who resides in the Community, next to cover orders of natural persons residing in the Community, and thereafter to cover orders of other members of the general public. In the event orders for Holding Company Common Stock in any of these categories exceed the number of shares available for sale, shares any be allocated on a pro rata basis within a category based on the amount of the respective orders. The Holding Company shall use its best efforts consistent with this Plan to distribute Holding Company Common Stock sold in the Community Offering in such a manner as to promote the widest distribution practicable of such stock. The Holding Company reserves the right to reject any or all orders in whole or in part, which are received in the Community Offering. Any Person may purchase up to 100,000 shares of Holding Company Common Stock in the Community Offering, subject to the purchase limitations specified in Section 14\. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, up to 20% of the shares of Holding Company Common Stock to be sold in the Offering may be offered on a first-priority basis to "qualified institutional buyers" (as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).   

 B. Notwithstanding A above, if subscriptions totaling at least the adjusted maximum of the Offering Range are not received in the Subscription Offering in the categories described in Sections 8 through 11 herein, then unsubscribed Subscription Shares may be issued to stockholders of the Acquiree Corporation in exchange for their shares of the Acquiree Corporation or in any other manner that facilitates the completion of the Merger, provided that total Merger Shares, including Merger Shares issued pursuant to this Section 12B, are less than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock of the Holding Company immediately after the closing of the Conversion and Merger.     ##### 

    

    13.  |   | SYNDICATED COMMUNITY OFFERING/UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC
OFFERING  
---|---|--- 
  

 If feasible, the Board of Directors may determine to offer Subscription Shares not issued in the Subscription Offering, in a Syndicated Community Offering and/or through an Underwriter in an Underwritten Public Offering, all subject to such terms, conditions and procedures as may be determined by the Holding Company, in a manner that will achieve the widest distribution of the Holding Company Common Stock, subject to the right of the Holding Company to accept or reject in whole or in part any subscriptions in the Syndicated Community Offering. In the case of an Underwritten Public Offering, Subscription Shares will be sold to an Underwriter for resale in an Underwritten Public Offering. The price to be paid by the Underwriter for Subscription Shares will be equal to the aggregate price at which such shares were offered in the Subscription Offering, less the amount of an underwriting discount, which will be negotiated by the Holding Company and the Underwriter. In the Syndicated Community Offering and/or Underwritten Public Offering, any Person may purchase up to 100,000 shares of Holding Company Common Stock, subject to the purchase limitations specified in Section 14.   

 Provided that the Subscription Offering has begun, the Holding Company may begin the Syndicated Community Offering or Underwritten Public Offering at any time, provided that the completion of the offer and sale of the Holding Company Common Stock will be conditioned upon the approval of the Plan by Voting Depositors. If the Syndicated Community Offering or Underwritten Public Offering does not begin pursuant to the provisions of the preceding sentence, such offering will begin as soon as practicable following the date upon which the Subscription and Community Offerings terminate. The provisions of Section 14 shall not be applicable to sales to Underwriters in an Underwritten Public Offering for purposes of such an offering, but shall be applicable to the sales by the Underwriters to the public.   

 If for any reason a Syndicated Community Offering or an Underwritten Public Offering of shares of Holding Company Common Stock not sold in the Subscription and Community Offerings cannot be effected, or in the event that any insignificant residue of shares of Holding Company Common Stock is not sold in the Subscription and Community Offerings or in the Syndicated Community or Underwritten Public Offering, if possible, the Holding Company will make other arrangements for the disposition of unsubscribed shares aggregating at least the minimum of the Offering Range. Such other purchase arrangements will be subject to receipt of any required approval of the OTS.   

    14.  |   | LIMITATION ON PURCHASES  
---|---|--- 
  

 The following limitations shall apply to all purchases and issuances of shares of Conversion Stock:   

 A. The maximum number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock which may be subscribed for or purchased in all categories in the Offering by any Person or Participant together with any Associate or group of Persons Acting in Concert shall not exceed 200,000 shares of Holding Company Common Stock, except that the Employee Plans may subscribe for up to 10% of the Holding Company Common Stock issued in the Offering (including shares issued in the event of an increase in the maximum of the Offering Range of 15%).   

 B. The maximum number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock which may be issued to or purchased in all categories of the Offering by Officers and Directors and their Associates in the aggregate, when combined with Exchange Shares received by such persons, shall not exceed 25% of the shares of Holding Company Common Stock issued in the Conversion.     ##### 

    

 C. A minimum of 25 shares of Holding Company Common Stock must be purchased by each Person purchasing shares in the Offering to the extent those shares are available; provided, however, that in the event the minimum number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock purchased times the price per share exceeds $500, then such minimum purchase requirement shall be reduced to such maximum number of shares which when multiplied by the price per share shall not exceed $500, as determined by the Board.   

 D. The maximum number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock that may be subscribed for or purchased in the Offering by any Person or Participant together with any Associate or group of Persons Acting in Concert, combined with Exchange Shares received by any such Person or Participant together with any Associate or group of Persons Acting in Concert, shall not exceed 5.0% of the shares of Holding Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the completion of the Conversion, except that this limitation shall not apply to the Employee Plans.   

 If the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock otherwise allocable pursuant to Sections 8 through 13, inclusive, to any Person or that Persons Associates would be in excess of the maximum number of shares permitted as set forth above, the number of shares of Holding Company Common Stock allocated to each such person shall be reduced to the lowest limitation applicable to that Person, and then the number of shares allocated to each group consisting of a Person and that Persons Associates shall be reduced so that the aggregate allocation to that Person and his or her Associates complies with the above limits.   

 Depending upon market or financial conditions, the Board of Directors of the Holding Company, with the receipt of any required approvals of the OTS and without further approval of Voting Depositors, may decrease or increase the purchase limitations in this Plan, provided that the maximum purchase limitations may not be increased to a percentage in excess of 5% of the shares issued in the Offering except as provided below. If the Holding Company increases the maximum purchase limitations, the Holding Company is only required to resolicit Persons who subscribed for the maximum purchase amount in the Subscription Offering and may, in the sole discretion of the Holding Company resolicit certain other large subscribers. In the event that the maximum purchase limitation is increased to 5% of the shares issued in the Offering, such limitation may be further increased to 9.99%, provided that orders for Holding Company Common Stock exceeding 5% of the shares of Holding Company Common Stock issued in the Offering shall not exceed in the aggregate 10% of the total shares of Holding Company Common Stock issued in the Offering. Requests to purchase additional shares of the Conversion Stock in the event that the purchase limitation is so increased will be determined by the Board of Directors of the Holding Company in its sole discretion.   

 In the event of an increase in the total number of shares offered in the Subscription Offering due to an increase in the maximum of the Offering Range of up to 15% (the "Adjusted Maximum"), the additional shares will be used to fill the Employee Plans orders and then will be allocated in accordance with the priorities set forth in this Plan.   

 For purposes of this Section 14, the Directors of the Bank, the Mid-Tier Holding Company and the Holding Company shall not be deemed to be Associates or a group affiliated with each other or otherwise Acting in Concert solely as a result of their being Directors of the Bank, the Mid-Tier Holding Company or the Holding Company.   

 Each Person purchasing Holding Company Common Stock in the Conversion shall be deemed to confirm that such purchase does not conflict with the above purchase limitations contained in this Plan.   

    15.  |   | PAYMENT FOR SUBSCRIPTION SHARES  
---|---|--- ##### 

     

 All payments for Holding Company Common Stock subscribed for in the Subscription Offering and Community Offering must be delivered in full to the Bank or Holding Company, together with a properly completed and executed Order Form, on or prior to the expiration date of the Offering; provided, however, that if the Employee Plans subscribe for shares in the Subscription Offering, such plans will not be required to pay for the shares at the time they subscribe but rather may pay for such shares of Holding Company Common Stock subscribed for by such plans at the Subscription Price upon consummation of the Conversion.   

 Payment for Holding Company Common Stock subscribed for shall be made by check, money order or bank draft. Alternatively, subscribers in the Subscription and Community Offerings may pay for the shares for which they have subscribed by authorizing the Bank on the Order Form to make a withdrawal from the designated types of Deposit Accounts at the Bank in an amount equal to the aggregate Subscription Price of such shares. Such authorized withdrawal, shall be without penalty as to premature withdrawal. If the authorized withdrawal is from a certificate account, and the remaining balance does not meet the applicable minimum balance requirement, the certificate shall be canceled at the time of withdrawal, without penalty, and the remaining balance will earn interest at the passbook rate. Funds for which a withdrawal is authorized will remain in the subscribers Deposit Account but may not be used by the subscriber during the Subscription and Community Offerings. Thereafter, the withdrawal will be given effect only to the extent necessary to satisfy the subscription (to the extent it can be filled) at the Subscription Price per share. Interest will continue to be earned on any amounts authorized for withdrawal until such withdrawal is given effect. Interest on funds received will be paid by the Bank at not less than the passbook rate on payments for Holding Company Common Stock. Such interest will be paid from the date payment is received by the Bank until consummation or termination of the Conversion. If for any reason the Conversion is not consummated, all payments made by subscribers in the Subscription and Community Offerings will be refunded to them with interest. In case of amounts authorized for withdrawal from Deposit Accounts, refunds will be made by canceling the authorization for withdrawal. The Bank is prohibited by regulation from knowingly making any loans or granting any lines of credit for the purchase of stock in the Conversion, and therefore, will not do so.   

    16.  |   | MANNER OF EXERCISING SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS THROUGH ORDER
FORMS  
---|---|--- 
  

 As soon as practicable after the Prospectus prepared by the Holding Company and Bank has been declared effective by the SEC, Order Forms will be distributed to the Eligible Account Holders, Employee Plans, Supplemental Eligible Account Holders and Other Depositors at their last known addresses appearing on the records of the Bank for the purpose of subscribing for shares of Holding Company Common Stock in the Subscription Offering and will be made available for use by those Persons to whom a Prospectus is delivered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holding Company may elect to send Order Forms only to those Persons who request them after receipt of such notice in a form approved by the OTS and which is adequate to apprise the Eligible Account Holders, Employee Plans, Supplemental Eligible Account Holders and Other Depositors of the pendency of the Subscription Offering. Such notice may be included with the proxy statement for the Special Meeting of Depositors and also may be included in the notice of the pendency of the Conversion and the Special Meeting of Depositors sent to all Eligible Account Holders in accordance with regulations and policy of the OTS.   

 Each Order Form will be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus describing the Holding Company, the Bank, the Holding Company Common Stock and the Offering. Each Order Form will contain, among other things, the following:   

 A. A specified date by which all Order Forms must be received by the Bank or the Holding Company, which date shall be not less than 20, nor more than 45 days, following the date on which the Order Forms are mailed by the Holding Company, and which date will constitute the termination of the Subscription Offering unless extended;     ##### 

    

 B. The Subscription Price per share for shares of Holding Company Common Stock to be sold in the Offering;   

 C. A description of the minimum and maximum number of Subscription Shares which may be subscribed for pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights or otherwise purchased in the Subscription and Community Offering;   

 D. Instructions as to how the recipient of the Order Form is to indicate thereon the number of Subscription Shares for which such person elects to subscribe and the available alternative methods of payment therefor;   

 E. An acknowledgment that the recipient of the Order Form has received a final copy of the prospectus prior to execution of the Order Form;   

 F. A statement to the effect that all subscription rights are nontransferable, will be void at the end of the Subscription Offering, and can only be exercised by delivering to the Holding Company within the subscription period such properly completed and executed Order Form, together with payment in the full amount of the aggregate purchase price as specified in the Order Form for the shares of Holding Company Common Stock for which the recipient elects to subscribe in the Subscription Offering (or by authorizing on the Order Form that the Bank withdraw said amount from the subscribers Deposit Account at the Bank); and   

 G. A statement to the effect that the executed Order Form, once received by the Holding Company, may not be modified or amended by the subscriber without the consent of the Holding Company.   

 Notwithstanding the above, the Holding Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to accept or reject orders received on photocopied or facsimilied order forms.   

    17.  |   | UNDELIVERED, DEFECTIVE OR LATE ORDER FORM; INSUFFICIENT
PAYMENT  
---|---|--- 
  

 In the event Order Forms (a) are not delivered and are returned, or notice of nondelivery is given, to the Holding Company or the Bank by the United States Postal Service, (b) are not received back by the Holding Company or are received by the Holding Company after the expiration date specified thereon, (c) are defectively filled out or executed, (d) are not accompanied by the full required payment, unless waived by the Holding Company, for the shares of Holding Company Common Stock subscribed for (including cases in which deposit accounts from which withdrawals are authorized are insufficient to cover the amount of the required payment), or (e) are not mailed pursuant to a "no mail" order placed in effect by the account holder, the subscription rights of the Person to whom such rights have been granted will lapse as though such Person failed to return the completed Order Form within the time period specified thereon; provided, however, that the Holding Company may, but will not be required to, waive any immaterial irregularity on any Order Form or require the submission of corrected Order Forms or the remittance of full payment for subscribed shares by such date as the Holding Company may specify. The interpretation of the Holding Company of terms and conditions of this Plan and of the Order Forms will be final, subject to the authority of the OTS.   

    18.  |   | RESIDENTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND CERTAIN STATES  
---|---|--- 
  

 The Holding Company will make reasonable efforts to comply with the securities laws of all States in the United States in which Persons entitled to subscribe for shares of Holding Company Common Stock pursuant to this Plan reside. However, no such Person will be issued subscription rights or be permitted to purchase shares of Holding Company Common Stock in the Subscription     ##### 

    

Offering if such Person resides in a foreign country; or in a State of
the United States with respect to which all of the following apply: (A) a
small number of Persons otherwise eligible to subscribe for shares under the
Plan reside in such state; (B) the issuance of subscription rights or the
offer or sale of shares of Holding Company Common Stock to such Persons would
require the Holding Company under the securities laws of such state, to
register as a broker, dealer, salesman or agent or to register or otherwise
qualify its securities for sale in such state; and (C) such registration or
qualification would be impracticable for reasons of cost or otherwise.  

    19.  |   | ESTABLISHMENT OF LIQUIDATION ACCOUNT  
---|---|--- 
  

 The Bank shall establish at the time of the MHC Merger, a Liquidation Account in an amount equal to the greater of: (a) the percentage of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the Mid-Tier Holding Company owned by the Mutual Holding Company multiplied by the Mid-Tier Holding Companys total stockholders equity as reflected in the latest statement of financial condition contained in the final Prospectus used in the Conversion, or (b) the retained earnings of the Bank as of the latest financial statements set forth in the prospectus used in connection with the Banks initial mutual holding company reorganization and minority stock offering. Following the Conversion, the Liquidation Account will be maintained by the Bank for the benefit of the Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Eligible Account Holders who continue to maintain their Deposit Accounts at the Bank. Each Eligible Account Holder and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder shall, with respect to his Deposit Account, hold a related inchoate interest in a portion of the Liquidation Account balance, in relation to his Deposit Account balance at the Eligibility Record Date or Supplemental Eligibility Record Date, respectively, or to such balance as it may be subsequently reduced, as hereinafter provided.   

 In the event of a complete liquidation of the Bank (and only in such event), following all liquidation payments to creditors (including those to Account Holders to the extent of their Deposit Accounts) each Eligible Account Holder and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder shall be entitled to receive a liquidating distribution from the Liquidation Account, in the amount of the then adjusted subaccount balance for his Deposit Account then held, before any liquidation distribution may be made to any holders of the Banks capital stock. No merger, consolidation, purchase of bulk assets with assumption of Deposit Accounts and other liabilities, or similar transactions with an FDIC-insured institution, in which the Bank is not the surviving institution, shall be deemed to be a complete liquidation for this purpose. In such transactions, the Liquidation Account shall be assumed by the surviving institution.   

 The initial subaccount balance for a Deposit Account held by an Eligible Account Holder and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder shall be determined by multiplying the opening balance in the Liquidation Account by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the Qualifying Deposits of such account holder and the denominator of which is the total amount of all Qualifying Deposits of all Eligible Account Holders and Supplemental Account Holders. Such initial subaccount balance shall not be increased, but shall be subject to downward adjustment as described below.   

 If, at the close of business on any December 31 annual closing date, commencing on or after the effective date of the Conversion, the deposit balance in the Deposit Account of an Eligible Account Holder or Supplemental Eligible Account Holder is less than the lesser of (i) the balance in the Deposit Account at the close of business on any other annual closing date subsequent to the Eligibility Record Date or Supplemental Eligibility Record Date, or (ii) the amount of the Qualifying Deposit in such Deposit Account as of the Eligibility Record Date or Supplemental Eligibility Record Date, the subaccount balance for such Deposit Account shall be adjusted by reducing such subaccount balance in an amount proportionate to the reduction in such deposit balance. In the event of such downward adjustment, the subaccount balance shall not be subsequently increased, notwithstanding any    

A-17      

* * *

 

##### 

  

subsequent increase in the deposit balance of the related Deposit Account.
If any such Deposit Account is closed, the related subaccount shall be
reduced to zero.  

 The creation and maintenance of the Liquidation Account shall not operate to restrict the use or application of any of the equity accounts of the Bank, except that the Bank shall not declare or pay a cash dividend on, or repurchase any of, its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause its equity to be reduced below (i) the amount required for the Liquidation Account; or (ii) the regulatory capital requirements of the Bank.  

    20.  |   | VOTING RIGHTS OF STOCKHOLDERS  
---|---|--- 
  

 Following consummation of the Conversion, the holders of the voting capital stock of the Holding Company shall have the exclusive voting rights with respect to the Holding Company.  

    21.  |   | RESTRICTIONS ON RESALE OR SUBSEQUENT DISPOSITION  
---|---|--- 
  

 A. All Subscription Shares purchased by Directors or Officers of the Holding Company or the Bank in the Offering shall be subject to the restriction that, except as provided in this Section or as may be approved by the OTS, no interest in such shares may be sold or otherwise disposed of for value for a period of one year following the date of purchase in the Offering.  

 B. The restriction on disposition of Subscription Shares set forth above in this Section shall not apply to the following:  

 (1) Any exchange of such shares in connection with a merger or acquisition involving the Bank or the Holding Company, as the case may be, which has been approved by the appropriate federal regulatory agency; and   

 (2) Any disposition of such shares following the death of the person to whom such shares were initially sold under the terms of the Plan.   

 C. With respect to all Subscription Shares subject to restrictions on resale or subsequent disposition, each of the following provisions shall apply:  

 (1) Each certificate representing shares restricted by this section shall bear a legend prominently stamped on its face giving notice of the restriction;   

 (2) Instructions shall be issued to the stock transfer agent for the Holding Company not to recognize or effect any transfer of any certificate or record of ownership of any such shares in violation of the restriction on transfer; and   

 (3) Any shares of capital stock of the Holding Company issued with respect to a stock dividend, stock split, or otherwise with respect to ownership of outstanding Subscription Shares subject to the restriction on transfer hereunder shall be subject to the same restriction as is applicable to such Conversion Stock.   

    22.  |   | REQUIREMENTS FOR STOCK PURCHASES BY DIRECTORS AND
OFFICERS FOLLOWING THE CONVERSION  
---|---|--- 
  

 For a period of three years following the Conversion, no Officer, Director or their Associates shall purchase, without the prior written approval of the OTS, any outstanding shares of Holding Company Common Stock except from a broker-dealer registered with the SEC. This provision shall not apply to negotiated transactions involving more than 1% of the outstanding shares of Holding   ##### 

    

Company Common Stock, the exercise of any options pursuant to a stock
option plan or purchases of Holding Company Common Stock made by or held by
any Tax-Qualified Employee Stock Benefit Plan or Non-Tax-Qualified Employee
Stock Benefit Plan of the Bank or the Holding Company (including the Employee
Plans) which may be attributable to any Officer or Director. As used herein,
the term "negotiated transaction" means a transaction in which the securities
are offered and the terms and arrangements relating to any sale are arrived
at through direct communications between the seller or any person acting on
its behalf and the purchaser or his investment representative. The term
"investment representative" shall mean a professional investment advisor
acting as agent for the purchaser and independent of the seller and not
acting on behalf of the seller in connection with the transaction.  

    23.  |   | TRANSFER OF DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS  
---|---|--- 
  

 Each person holding a Deposit Account at the Bank at the time of Conversion shall retain an identical Deposit Account at the Bank following Conversion in the same amount and subject to the same terms and conditions (except as to voting and liquidation rights).

 Within the time period required by applicable laws and regulations, the Holding Company will register the securities issued in connection with the Conversion pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and will not deregister such securities for a period of at least three years thereafter, except that the maintenance of registration for three years requirement may be fulfilled by any successor to the Holding Company. In addition, the Holding Company will use its best efforts to encourage and assist a market-maker to establish and maintain a market for the Conversion Stock and to list those securities on a national or regional securities exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market.  

    25.  |   | TAX OPINIONS  
---|---|--- 
  

 Consummation of the Conversion is expressly conditioned upon prior receipt by the Mutual Holding Company, the Mid-Tier Holding Company and the Bank of an opinion of counsel with respect to federal and state tax laws, and either an opinion of counsel or a letter of advice from their tax advisor with respect to applicable state tax laws, to the effect that consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Conversion and this Plan will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of the applicable codes and will not otherwise result in any material adverse tax consequences to the Mutual Holding Company, the Mid-Tier Holding Company, the Holding Company or the Bank, or the account holders receiving subscription rights before or after the Conversion, except in each case to the extent, if any, that subscription rights or interests in the Liquidation Account are deemed to have value on the date such rights are issued.

---|---|--- 
  

 A. The Holding Company and the Bank are authorized to adopt Tax-Qualified Employee Stock Benefit Plans in connection with the Conversion, including without limitation, an ESOP. Existing as well as any newly created Tax-Qualified Employee Stock Benefit Plans may purchase shares of Holding Company Common Stock in the Offering, to the extent permitted by the terms of such benefit plans and this Plan.

thereof or under such plan or program of the Bank, and (ii) rights
outstanding under all stock option plans shall be assumed by the Holding
Company and thereafter shall be rights only for shares of Holding Company
Common Stock, with each such right being for a number of shares of Holding
Company Common Stock based upon the Exchange Ratio and the number of shares
of Mid-Tier Holding Company common stock that were available thereunder
immediately prior to consummation of the Conversion, with the price adjusted
to reflect the Exchange Ratio but with no change in any other term
or condition of such right.  

 C. The Holding Company and the Bank are authorized to enter into employment agreements with their executive officers.

 A. The Holding Company shall comply with any applicable regulation in the repurchase of any shares of its capital stock following consummation of the Conversion.

 _EXHIBIT B_    

FORM OF AFFILIATE AGREEMENT   

See attached.   ##### 

 

AFFILIATES AGREEMENT   

 This AFFILIATES AGREEMENT, dated as of December____, 2003, is entered into by and between Wicked Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Newco"), and the stockholders of BSB Bancorp, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company"), identified on _Schedule I_ hereto (collectively, the "Stockholders").   

 WHEREAS, Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc., a federal corporation ("Parent"), SBU Bank, a federally chartered savings bank and majority owned subsidiary of Parent ("SBU Bank"), Newco, Partners Trust, MHC ("MHC"), and Company have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 23, 2003 (the "Agreement"), which is conditioned upon the execution of this Affiliates Agreement and which provides for, among other things, the merger of Company with and into Newco, with Newco being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"); and   

 WHEREAS, in order to induce Newco to enter into and consummate the Agreement, each of the Stockholders agrees to, among other things, vote in favor of the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Company;   

 NOW, THEREFORE in consideration of the premises, the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

 1. _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Each Stockholder represents and warrants, severally as to such Stockholder only and not jointly, that the number of shares of Company common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), set forth opposite such Stockholders name on _Schedule I_ hereto is the total number of shares of Company Common Stock over which such person has "beneficial ownership" within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except that the provisions of Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) shall be considered without any limit as to time.  

 2. _Agreements of the Stockholders_. Each Stockholder covenants and agrees that:  

 (a) Such Stockholder shall, at any meeting of the holders of any or all classes or series of Company Common Stock called for the purpose (or in connection with any action taken by written consent), vote or cause to be voted all shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which such Stockholder has voting power (including the power to vote or to direct the voting of) whether owned as of the date hereof or hereafter acquired (the "Shares") (i) in favor of the Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement and (ii) against any plan or proposal pursuant to which Company is to be acquired by or merged with, or pursuant to which Company proposes to sell all or substantially all of its assets and liabilities to, any person, entity or group (other than Newco or any affiliate thereof) or any other action that is inconsistent with the Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or any other provision of this Affiliates Agreement, Newco shall have no agreement, arrangement or understanding with any Stockholder as to directing the voting of any shares of Company Common Stock to the extent it would result in Newco, individually or with any of their Affiliates (as defined in the next sentence) or Associates (as defined in the next sentence) becoming the Beneficial Owner (as defined in the next sentence) of five percent or more of the Voting Stock (as defined in the next sentence) of Company. The terms "Affiliates", "Associates", "Beneficial Owner", and "Voting Stock" are as defined or referenced in Article 14 of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company. In determining which, if any, Stockholder with whom Newco shall have no agreement, arrangement or understanding as to directing the voting of any shares of Company Common Stock, reference shall be    ##### 

    

made to the Stockholders in order of the amount of Company Common Stock set
forth opposite such Stockholders name on _Schedule I_ hereto, beginning
with the Stockholder who reports the fewest number of shares, and continuing
in ascending order therefrom.  

 (b) Each Stockholder hereby grants to Newco a proxy to vote such Stockholders Shares as indicated Section 2(a) above. Such Stockholder intends this proxy to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest and will take such further action or execute such other instruments as may be reasonably necessary to effect the intent of this proxy. Such Stockholder hereby revokes any proxy previously granted by him or her with respect to the Shares.   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time (as defined in the Agreement), except as otherwise expressly permitted hereby, such Stockholder shall not sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock.   

 (d) Such Stockholder shall not in his or her capacity as a stockholder of Company directly or indirectly encourage or solicit, initiate or hold discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any person, entity or group (other than Newco or an affiliate thereof) concerning any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or liabilities not in the ordinary course of business, sale of shares of capital stock or similar transaction involving Company or otherwise inconsistent with the Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby. Nothing in this document shall impair such Stockholders ability to act or omit to act in accordance with such Stockholders fiduciary obligations, or to act or omit to act in any manner permitted by the Agreement, as a director of Company.   

 (e) Such Stockholder shall not, prior to the public release by Newco of an earnings report to its stockholders covering at least one month of operations after consummation of the Merger (the "Restricted Period"), sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (the "Newco Common Stock"), of Newco.   

 (f) Such Stockholder shall comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws in connection with any sale of Newco Common Stock received in exchange for Company Common Stock in the Merger, including the trading and volume limitations as to sales by affiliates contained in Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   

 3. _Successors and Assigns_. A Stockholder may sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of his or her shares of Company Common Stock only with the prior written consent of Newco and if the acquirer of such Company Common Stock agrees in writing to be bound by this Affiliates Agreement.  

 4. _Termination_. The parties agree and intend that this Affiliates Agreement be a valid and binding agreement enforceable against the parties hereto and that damages and other remedies at law for the breach of this Affiliates Agreement are inadequate. This Affiliates Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger by the written consent of the parties hereto and shall be automatically terminated in the event that the Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.  

 5. _Notices_. Notices may be provided to Newco and the Stockholders in the manner specified in the Agreement, with all notices to the Stockholders being provided to them at the addresses set forth at _Schedule I_.  

 6. _Governing Law_. This Affiliates Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.   ##### 

    

 7. _Counterparts_. This Affiliates Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same and each of which shall be deemed an original.  

 8. _Headings_. The Section headings contained herein are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Affiliates Agreement.  

 9. _Regulatory Approval_. If any provision of this Affiliates Agreement requires the approval of any regulatory authority in order to be enforceable, then such provision shall not be effective until such approval is obtained;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not affect the enforceability of any other provision of this Affiliates Agreement.
