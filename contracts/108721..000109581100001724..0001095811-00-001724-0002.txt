AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 13, 2000 (this
"AGREEMENT"), among Wynn\'s International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"COMPANY"), Parker-Hannifin Corporation, an Ohio corporation (the
"PURCHASER"), and WI Holding Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Purchaser ("MERGER SUB").   W I T N E S S E T H:  
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Purchaser have determined that it
is in the best interests of its shareholders for the Purchaser to acquire
the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
and   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it
is in the best interests of its stockholders for the Purchaser to acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;
and   WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that the Purchaser
will cause Merger Sub to make a cash tender offer (the "OFFER") to purchase
all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (the "SHARES"), for $23.00 per Share, or such higher
price as may be paid in the Offer (the "PER SHARE AMOUNT"), net to the seller
in cash; and   WHEREAS, also in furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors
of the Purchaser, the Company and Merger Sub have each approved the merger
(the "MERGER") of Merger Sub with and into the Company following the Offer
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
("DELAWARE LAW") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein; and   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY
BOARD OF DIRECTORS") has unanimously resolved to recommend that holders of
Shares accept the Offer and approve this Agreement and the Merger and has
determined that the Offer and the Merger are fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements herein
contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, the
Purchaser and Merger Sub hereby agree as follows:    6   ARTICLE I  THE
TENDER OFFER   Section 1.1 THE OFFER.   (a) Provided that this Agreement
shall not have been terminated in accordance with SECTION 8.1 hereof and none
of the events set forth in paragraphs (a) - (g) of ANNEX I hereto shall have
occurred and be continuing, the Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub to commence
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the "EXCHANGE ACT")) the Offer as promptly as practicable, but in no event
later than June 23, 2000, and, subject to the conditions of the Offer, shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Offer. The
obligation of the Purchaser to cause Merger Sub to consummate the Offer and
to accept for payment any Shares tendered pursuant thereto shall be subject
to the satisfaction of those conditions set forth in ANNEX I. The Purchaser
and Merger Sub expressly reserve the right to waive any such condition or to
increase the Per Share Amount. The Per Share Amount shall be net to the
seller in cash, without interest, subject to reduction only for any
applicable federal back-up withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by the
seller. The Company agrees that no Shares held by the Company will be
tendered pursuant to the Offer.   (b) Without the prior written consent of
the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and the Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub
not to, (i) decrease the Per Share Amount or change the form of consideration
payable in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought, (iii) amend
or waive satisfaction of the Minimum Condition (as defined in ANNEX I) or
(iv) impose additional conditions to the Offer or amend any other term of the
Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares; provided, however, that
if on the initial expiration date of the Offer, which shall be 20 Business
Days following commencement of the Offer (together with any extensions
thereof, if any, the "EXPIRATION DATE"), all conditions to the Offer shall
not have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub may extend the Expiration Date
for such additional period or periods as it may determine to permit such
conditions to be satisfied; provided, further, however, that the Expiration
Date may not be extended beyond August 15, 2000, except with the written
consent of the Company. In addition, the Purchaser may cause Merger Sub,
without the consent of the Company, to elect to provide a subsequent offering
period for the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act. The
Purchaser shall cause Merger Sub, on the terms and subject to the
prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer, to accept for
payment and purchase, as soon as permitted under the terms of the Offer, all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date.  
(c) The Purchaser and Merger Sub agree that if at any scheduled Expiration
Date of the Offer, the Competition Laws Condition (as defined in ANNEX I)
shall have not been satisfied, Merger Sub shall extend the Offer from time to
time (each such extension not to exceed ten Business Days after
the previously scheduled expiration date, unless the parties otherwise
agree), subject to any right of the Purchaser, Merger Sub or the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms hereof.   (d) The Offer
shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "OFFER TO PURCHASE")
having only the conditions set forth in ANNEX I hereto. As soon as
practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, the Purchaser shall file with
the Securities and Exchange    2  7  Commission (the "SEC") a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "SCHEDULE TO") with respect to the Offer that will comply in all
material respects with the provisions of, and satisfy in all material
respects the requirements of, such Schedule TO and all applicable federal
securities laws, and will contain (including as an exhibit) or incorporate by
reference the Offer to Purchase and forms of the related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement (which documents, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto, and any other SEC schedule or form that is
filed in connection with the Offer and related transactions, are referred
to collectively herein as the "OFFER DOCUMENTS"). Each of the Purchaser,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information
provided by it for use in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents if and to
the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect and to supplement the information provided by it specifically for use
in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the
Purchaser and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC
and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any Offer Documents
before they are filed with the SEC.   Section 1.2 COMPANY ACTION.   (a)
The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and
warrants that (i) the Company Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called
and held on June 13, 2000, unanimously and duly approved and adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer
and the Merger (such approval being sufficient to render each of (y) Section
203 of Delaware Law and (z) Article Ninth of the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation inapplicable to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger), recommended that
the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares
pursuant to the Offer and approve this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and determined that this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger,
are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company and
(ii) J.P. Morgan and Co., Incorporated, the Company\'s financial advisor, has
rendered to the Company Board of Directors its written opinion that the
consideration to be received by the holders of Shares and Options of the
Company pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to such holders from a
financial point of view. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the
Offer Documents of the recommendation referred to in this SECTION 1.2,
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may withdraw or modify such
recommendation to the extent, and only to the extent and on the conditions,
specified in SECTION 5.2(b).   (b) The Company shall file with the SEC,
simultaneously with (or at such later date as may be mutually agreed between
the Company and the Purchaser) the filing by the Purchaser and Merger Sub of
the Schedule TO with respect to the Offer, a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "SCHEDULE 14D-9") that will comply in all material respects with
the    3  8  provisions of all applicable federal securities laws. The
Company shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company
along with the Offer Documents promptly after the commencement of the Offer.
The Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall contain the recommendations
of the Company Board of Directors described in SECTION 1.2(a) hereof. The
Company agrees promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall become false or misleading in any material respect (and the
Purchaser and Merger Sub, with respect to written information supplied by it
specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company
of any required corrections of such information and cooperate with the
Company with respect to correcting such information) and to supplement the
information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to include any information that
shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the
Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as
so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company\'s stockholders to the extent required by applicable federal
securities laws. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed
with the SEC.   (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly
upon execution of this Agreement furnish the Purchaser, Merger Sub or their
agents with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record
holders of Shares and security position listings of Shares held in stock
depositories, each as of a recent date, and shall promptly furnish the
Purchaser, Merger Sub or their agents with such additional information,
including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and security position
listings, and such other information and assistance as the Purchaser, Merger
Sub or their respective agents may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.  
Section 1.3 DIRECTORS.   (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Merger Sub of any
Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time thereafter as Shares are
acquired by Merger Sub, the Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company
Board of Directors as will give the Purchaser, subject to compliance with
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, representation on the Company Board of
Directors equal to at least that number of directors which equals the product
of the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (giving
effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to this sentence and
including current directors serving as officers of the Company) multiplied by
the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by the
Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser (including for purposes of this
SECTION 1.3 such Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer,
but excluding Shares held by the Company) bears to the number of Shares
outstanding. At such times, if requested by the Purchaser, the Company shall
also cause each committee of the Company Board of Directors to include
persons designated by the Purchaser constituting the same percentage of each
such committee as the Purchaser\'s designees are of the Company Board of
Directors. The Company shall, upon request by the Purchaser, promptly
increase the size of the Company Board of Directors or exercise its best
efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as
is necessary to enable the Purchaser designees to be elected to the Company
Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of this SECTION 1.3 and shall
cause the Purchaser\'s designees to be so elected; provided, however, that,
in the event that    4  9  the Purchaser\'s designees are appointed or
elected to the Company Board of Directors, until the Effective Time (as
defined in SECTION 2.2) the Company Board of Directors shall have at least
two directors who are directors on the date hereof and who are neither
officers of the Company nor designees, stockholders, affiliates or associates
(within the meaning of the federal securities laws) of the Purchaser (one or
more of such directors, the "INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS"); provided, further, that
if no Independent Directors remain, the other directors shall designate one
person to fill one of the vacancies who shall not be either an officer of the
Company or a designee, stockholder, affiliate or associate of the Purchaser,
and such person shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of
this Agreement.   (b) Subject to applicable Law (as defined in SECTION
4.18), the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in
order to fulfill its obligations under this SECTION 1.3 and shall include in
the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders promptly after the commencement of
the Offer (or an amendment thereof or an information statement pursuant to
Rule 14f-1 if the Purchaser has not theretofore designated directors) such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is
required under such Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this SECTION 1.3. The Purchaser will supply the Company and
be solely responsible for any information with respect to itself and its
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1.   (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, prior to the Effective Time, the affirmative vote of a majority of
the Independent Directors shall be required to (i) amend or terminate this
Agreement on behalf of the Company, (ii) exercise or waive any of the
Company\'s rights or remedies hereunder, (iii) extend the time for
performance of the Purchaser\'s or Merger Sub\'s obligations hereunder, or
(iv) take any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement
required to be taken by the Company\'s Board of Directors.   ARTICLE II 
THE MERGER   Section 2.1 THE MERGER. At the Effective Time and subject to
and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
Delaware Law, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, the

corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"SURVIVING CORPORATION."   Section 2.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. On or as promptly as
practicable after the Closing Date (as defined in SECTION 2.3), the parties
hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware ("CERTIFICATE OF
MERGER"), in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of Delaware Law. The Merger will become effective at such
time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware, or at such subsequent date or time as the Company
and Merger Sub agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time of
such filing being the "EFFECTIVE TIME").    5  10   Section 2.3 EFFECT
OF THE MERGER; CLOSING. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time
all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at a time and on a date (the "CLOSING
DATE") to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third
Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the latest to occur of the
conditions precedent set forth in ARTICLE VII, at the offices of Jones, Day,
Reavis and Pogue, North Point, 901 Lakeside Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio,
unless another time, date or location is agreed to in writing by the parties.
"BUSINESS DAY" means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or a federal
holiday.   Section 2.4 SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or
Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to
take and do, in the name and on behalf of such corporation or otherwise, all
such other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest,
perfect or confirm any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise
to carry out the provisions of this Agreement.   Section 2.5 CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION; BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS.   (a) Unless otherwise
determined by the Purchaser before the Effective Time, at the Effective Time,
the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended to be in the
form of the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time and will be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by Law and such amended Certificate of Incorporation.   (b) The
Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately before the Effective Time,
will be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.   (c) The directors of Merger Sub
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time will be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case until the earlier of their death, resignation or until their
successors are elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be. If, at
the Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on the board of directors of the
Surviving Corporation or in any office of the Surviving Corporation, such
vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner provided by applicable
Law.    6  11   Section 2.6 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of, the
Merger Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:   (a) Each
Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other
than any Shares to be canceled pursuant to SECTION 2.6(b) and any Dissenting
Shares (as defined in SECTION 2.7(a)) shall be canceled and extinguished and
be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Amount in cash payable
to the holder thereof, without interest, upon surrender of the certificate
formerly representing such Share in the manner provided in SECTION 2.8. All
such Shares, when so converted, will no longer be outstanding and
will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate formerly representing any such Share will cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Per
Share Amount therefor, without interest, upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with SECTION 2.8. Any payment made pursuant to this
SECTION 2.6(a) will be made net of applicable withholding taxes to the extent
such withholding is required by Law.   (b) Each Share held in the treasury
of the Company and each Share owned by the Purchaser or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser immediately before the
Effective Time (other than Shares in trust accounts, managed accounts,
custodial accounts and the like that are beneficially owned by third parties)
shall be canceled and extinguished and no payment or other consideration
shall be made with respect thereto.   (c) Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time shall thereafter represent one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.   Section 2.7 DISSENTING SHARES.  
(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Shares held by a holder that has demanded and perfected his demand for
appraisal of his Shares in accordance with Delaware Law (including but
not limited to Section 262 thereof) and as of the Effective Time has
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his right to such appraisal
("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive cash pursuant to SECTION 2.6, but the holder thereof shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Delaware Law.   (b)
Notwithstanding the provisions of SECTION 2.7(a), if any holder of Shares
that demands appraisal of his Shares under Delaware Law shall effectively
withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) his right to
appraisal, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such
event, whichever later occurs, such holder\'s Shares shall automatically be
converted into and represent only the right to receive cash as provided in
SECTION 2.6(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate
or certificates formerly representing such Shares in accordance with SECTION
2.8.   (c) The Company shall give the Purchaser (i) prompt notice of
any written demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any
Shares, withdrawals of such demands,    7  12  and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law received by the Company and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under Delaware Law. The Company shall not voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal and shall not,
except with the prior written consent of the Purchaser, settle or offer
to settle any such demands.   Section 2.8 SURRENDER OF SHARES; STOCK
TRANSFER BOOKS.   (a) Before the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent for the holders of Shares in connection with the Merger (the
"PAYMENT AGENT") to receive the funds necessary to make the payments
contemplated by SECTION 2.6. When and as needed, the Purchaser shall make
available to the Payment Agent for the benefit of holders of Shares the
aggregate consideration to which such holders shall be entitled at the
Effective Time pursuant to SECTION 2.6.   (b) Each holder of a certificate
or certificates representing any Shares canceled upon the Merger pursuant to
SECTION 2.6(a) (each, a "CERTIFICATE") may thereafter surrender such
Certificate or Certificates to the Payment Agent, as agent for such holder,
to effect the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates on such holder\'s
behalf for a period ending twelve months after the Effective Time. The
Purchaser agrees that promptly after the Effective Time it shall cause the
distribution to holders of record of Shares as of the Effective Time of
appropriate materials to facilitate such surrender. Upon the surrender of
Certificates for cancellation, together with such materials, the Purchaser
shall cause the Payment Agent to pay the holder of such Certificates in
exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied
by the number of Shares represented by such Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each such Certificate (other than Certificates
representing Dissenting Shares and Certificates representing Shares held by
the Purchaser or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the
Purchaser or in the treasury of the Company) shall represent solely the right
to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto.   (c) If
payment of cash in respect of canceled Shares is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name a surrendered Certificate or instrument is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the Certificate or
instrument so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of such payment in
a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
or instrument surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Purchaser and the Payment Agent that such tax either has been paid or is
not payable.   (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further registration of
transfers of Shares or any other shares of capital stock of the Company
thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in SECTION 2.6(a) and SECTION
2.8(b). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon the
surrender of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately before the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares.    8  13   (e) Promptly
following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, the
Payment Agent shall deliver to the Purchaser all cash, certificates and other
documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated hereby,
and the Payment Agent\'s duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and
Certificates representing Shares held by the Purchaser or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Purchaser or in the treasury of
the Company) may surrender such Certificate to the Purchaser and (subject
to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar Laws) receive
in consideration thereof the aggregate Per Share Amount relating thereto,
without any interest or dividends thereon.   (f) The Per Share Amount paid
in the Merger shall be net to the holder of Shares in cash, subject to
reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or, as set
forth in SECTION 2.8(c), stock transfer taxes payable by such holder.   (g)
In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Per Share Amount deliverable
in respect thereof as determined in accordance with SECTION 2.6; provided
that the Person to whom the Per Share Amount is paid shall, as a condition

directors named on SCHEDULE 2.9 hereto, the Company shall cause each then
outstanding option to purchase Shares (the "OPTIONS") granted under any of
the Company\'s stock option plans referred to in SECTION 4.2, each as amended

the time of such payment such Option is canceled and the holder of such
Option, if required by the terms of the Option, has executed and delivered a
release of any and all rights the holder had or may have had in respect of
such Option. As promptly as practicable following Merger Sub\'s purchase of a
majority of the outstanding Shares on a fully diluted basis pursuant to the

with respect to such restricted shares and Performance Shares.   (d) No
options shall be offered to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
the Plan Year commencing on January 1, 2001 under the Company\'s Employee

shall be deemed fully vested with respect to the number of
shares attributable to employee deductions through the last payroll period
ending before the Offer Completion Date. The Company shall then cancel such

order, judgment, injunction or decree that has had or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or could reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially delay the Company\'s ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.8 ASBESTOS
RELATED LITIGATION AND CLAIMS. SCHEDULE 4.8 of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a general description of the litigation and claims (and the process for
handling and settling such litigation and claims to date) to which Dynamic
Seals, Inc. and/or Wynn\'s Precision, Inc. is or are presently a party
relating to Dynamic Seals, Inc.\'s ownership of the assets that were
purchased by Dynamic Seals, Inc. pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated November 22, 1985, by and between the Company, Dynamic
Seals, Inc. and Hercules Products, Inc.   Section 4.9 ERISA COMPLIANCE.  
(a) SCHEDULE 4.9 (a) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of (i) United States bonus, pension, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock
purchase, stock option, phantom stock, retirement, vacation, employment,
disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical, life, severance or other
employee benefit plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries contributes or is obligated to contribute, and (ii) each change
of control agreement providing benefits to any current or former employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound (collectively, the "COMPANY BENEFIT PLANS"). For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "FOREIGN PLAN" refers to each plan,
agreement, arrangement or understanding that is subject to or governed by the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States and that would have
been treated as a Company Benefit Plan had it been a United States plan,
agreement, arrangement or understanding. With respect to each Company Benefit
Plan and Foreign Plan, no event has occurred and there exists no condition or
set of circumstances in connection with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability
with respect to any plan, agreement, arrangement or understanding of the type
described in this paragraph other than the Company Benefit Plans and the
Foreign Plans.   (b) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9 (b) of the
Disclosure Schedule, each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in
accordance with its terms, all applicable Laws, including the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and the terms of all
applicable collective bargaining agreements, except for any failures so to
administer any Company Benefit Plan that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
The Company, its Subsidiaries and all Company Benefit Plans are in compliance
with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
Laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining agreements, except
for any failures to be in such    19  24  compliance that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a), 401(k) or 4975(e)(7) of the Code is so
qualified and each trust established in connection with any Company Benefit
Plan that is intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section
501(a) of the Code is so exempt, except for such failures to qualify or to be
exempt that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No fact or event has
occurred which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the qualified status
of any such Company Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any such
trust, except for any occurrence that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
All contributions to, and payments from, the Company Benefit Plans that are
required to be made in accordance with such Company Benefit Plans, ERISA or
the Code have been timely made other than any failures that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. All trusts providing funding for Company Benefit Plans that
are intended to comply with Section 501(c)(9) of the Code are exempt from
federal income taxation and, together with any other welfare benefit funds
(as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in connection with
any of the Company Benefit Plans, have been operated and administered in
compliance with all applicable requirements such that neither the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, any Company Benefit Plan nor such trust or fund is
subject to any taxes, penalties or other liabilities imposed as a consequence
of failure to comply with such requirements other than any taxes, penalties
or other liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No welfare
benefit fund (as defined in Section 419(e)(1) of the Code) maintained in
connection with any of the Company Benefit Plans has provided any
"disqualified benefit" (as defined in Section 4976(b)(1) of the Code) for
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or had any liability for the
excise tax imposed by Section 4976 of the Code which has not been paid in
full other than liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (c)
Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated, which, together with the Company, or together
with any of its Subsidiaries, would be deemed to be a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b) of ERISA (an "ERISA
AFFILIATE") has incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than
for premiums pursuant to Section 4007 of ERISA which have been timely paid)
or Section 4971 of the Code, and no condition exists that presents a risk to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates of incurring any such liability or failure other than liabilities
or failures that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No Company Benefit Plan
has or has incurred an accumulated funding deficiency within the meaning of
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, nor has any waiver of the
minimum funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code
been requested of or granted by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan, nor has any lien in favor of any Company Benefit
Plan arisen under Section 412(n) of the Code or Section 302(f) of ERISA,
other than for an accumulated funding deficiency or those liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company, nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has been required
to provide security to any defined benefit pension plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code. To the    20  25  Company\'s knowledge, except
as disclosed on actuarial reports previously provided to the Purchaser, with
respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section
302 of ERISA or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code, the fair market value of the
assets of such Company Benefit Plan as of the date of such actuarial report
equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of all accumulated benefit
obligations under such Company Benefit Plan (whether or not vested), based
upon the actuarial assumptions used to prepare the most recent actuarial
report for such Company Benefit Plan. There has been no "reportable event"
within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder
which has not been reported in a timely fashion, as required, or which,
whether or not reported, would constitute grounds for the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") to institute termination proceedings
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan.   (d) Except for Company Benefit
Plans set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9(d) of the Disclosure Schedule and as
otherwise set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9(d) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Company
Benefit Plan provides medical or life insurance benefits (whether or not
insured) with respect to current or former employees or officers or directors
after retirement or other termination of service, other than any such
coverage required by Law.   (e) Except for Company Benefit Plans set forth
on SCHEDULE 4.9(e) of the Disclosure Schedule and except for Foreign Plans,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or
former employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to material severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (ii)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount
of compensation due any such employee, officer or director.   (f) Except as
set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each
Company Benefit Plan that is a bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase, stock
option, phantom stock, retirement or severance plan, the Company has
delivered or made available to the Purchaser a true and complete copy of: (i)
each writing constituting a part of such Company Benefit Plan, including,
without limitation, all Company Benefit Plan documents and trust agreements;
(ii) with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a qualified plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent annual financial report, if any;
and (iii) with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is a qualified plan
under Section 401(a) of the Code and is a pension plan, the most
recent actuarial report, if any.   (g) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE
4.9(g) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Company Benefit Plan is a multiemployer
plan (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or
a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a
"MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"). Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9(g) of the
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan. None of the Company, its Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any material withdrawal
liability under a Multiemployer Plan that has not been satisfied in
full.    21  26   (h) Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 4.9(h) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no pending or threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that
have been asserted or instituted, or to the knowledge of the Company, no set
of circumstances exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or
lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of
the trusts under any of the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be
expected to result in any liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
other than liabilities that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (i)
There have been no prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties
imposed on "fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by
ERISA with respect to the Company Benefit Plans that could result in any
liability or excise tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than liabilities or taxes that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (j) All contributions, transfers and
payments in respect of any Company Benefit Plan, other than transfers
incident to an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of Section 422
of the Code, have been or are fully deductible under the Code, except those
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (k) With respect to any insurance
policy that has, or does, provide funding for benefits under any Company
Benefit Plan, no insurance company issuing any such policy is in
receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such proceedings with respect to any insurer are
imminent other than proceedings that, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (l)
Except as could not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, with respect to each Foreign Plan:
(i) all amounts required to be reserved under each book reserved Foreign Plan
have been so reserved in accordance with reasonable accounting practices
prevailing in the country where such Foreign Plan is established; (ii) each
Foreign Plan required to be registered with a Governmental Authority
(as defined in SECTION 4.14) has been registered, has been maintained in
good standing with the appropriate Governmental Authorities, and has been
maintained and operated in accordance with its terms and applicable Law;
(iii) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Foreign Plan that is
a defined benefit pension plan (or termination indemnity plan), and the
liability of each insurer for each Foreign Plan that is a defined benefit
pension plan (or termination indemnity plan) and is funded through insurance
or the book reserve established for each Foreign Plan that is a defined
benefit pension plan (or termination indemnity plan) that utilizes book
reserves, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure
or provide for the liability for accrued benefits with respect to those
current and former employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries that
participate in such Foreign Plan according to the reasonable actuarial or
other applicable assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to or the funded status or book reserve of such
Foreign Plans; (iv) each    22  27  Foreign Plan complies with all
applicable Law; (v) all contributions required to be made to such Foreign
Plan have been timely made; and (vi) there are no actions, suits or claims
pending or threatened.   (m) For purposes of this SECTION 4.9, the term
"employee" will be considered to include individuals rendering personal
services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as independent
contractors.   Section 4.10 OFFER DOCUMENTS; PROXY STATEMENT. The proxy
statement to be sent to the stockholders of the Company in connection with

state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No representation or warranty is made
by the Company with respect to any information supplied by the Purchaser or
Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
14D-9.   Section 4.11 BROKERS. Except for J.P. Morgan and Co., Incorporated,
no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage,

contemplated hereby. Section 2115 of the California General Corporation Law
does not apply to the Company or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger.    23  28   Section 4.13
CONDUCT OF BUSINESS.   (a) Except as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof or on SCHEDULE 4.13 of the Disclosure Schedule, the
business of the Company and its Significant Subsidiaries is not being
conducted in default or violation of any term, condition or provision of (i)
its respective Certificate of Incorporation or Articles of Incorporation, as
applicable, or its respective By-Laws or Code of Regulations, as applicable,
or (ii) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease or
other instrument or agreement of any kind to which the Company or any of its
Significant Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company, any of its
Significant Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets may
be bound, or (iii) any federal, state, local or foreign statute, Law,
ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, concession, grant,
franchise, permit or license or other governmental authorization or approval
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries other than environmental
authorizations, which are handled exclusively in SECTION 4.18, and except in
the case of clause (ii) or (iii) above, any default or violation that would
not (A) have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) be reasonably expected
to have a materially adverse effect on the business, financial condition or
results of operations of Wynn Oil and the Wynn Oil Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole (an "OIL MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice, or has knowledge of any claim, alleging
any such violation, which is reasonably likely to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or, with respect to Wynn Oil and the Wynn
Oil Subsidiaries, an Oil Material Adverse Effect.   (b) The Company and its
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits, variances, consents, authorizations,
waivers, grants, franchises, concessions, exemptions, orders, registrations
and approvals of any governmental authority, domestic or foreign, or other
Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing, operation, occupancy and use of
their respective property and assets and the conduct of their respective
businesses as currently conducted (collectively, "PERMITS"). Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice that any Permit will
be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary course of
business, and the Company has no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any
such termination, modification or nonrenewal, except for Permits for which
the failure to have would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, or with
respect to Wynn Oil and the Wynn Oil Subsidiaries, an Oil Material Adverse
Effect. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not violate any Permit, or result in any termination, modification or
nonrenewals thereof, except for Permits for which the failure to have would
not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or, with respect to Wynn Oil and
the Wynn Oil Subsidiaries, an Oil Material Adverse Effect.   Section 4.14

behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "RETURNS")
have, to the extent required to be filed on or before the date hereof, been

its Subsidiaries for the payment of any amounts of any of the foregoing types
as a result of being a member of an AFFILIATED, consolidated, combined or
unitary group, or being a party to any written agreement or arrangement
whereby liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries for payment of such
amounts was determined or taken into account with reference to the liability
of any other entity, and (c) any liability of the Company or its Subsidiaries
for the payment of any amounts as a result of being a party to any written
Tax sharing agreements or arrangements binding on the Company or its
Subsidiaries or with respect to the payment of any amounts of any of the
foregoing types as a result of any express obligation to indemnify any other
Person or entity.   (b) The Returns filed were complete and accurate in all
material respects.   (c) Since 1997, no audit of any Returns by any Taxing

$500,000 in the aggregate.   (d) All material Taxes shown as due and
payable on the Returns that have been filed have been timely paid, or
withheld and remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority.   (e) Any
reserves established for Taxes with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any Pre-Closing Tax
Period for which no Return has yet been filed) reflected on the books of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (excluding any provision for deferred income
taxes) are adequate in accordance with GAAP, except to the extent any
inadequacies in any reserves would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   (f) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any
member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a member has granted any extension
or waiver of the statute of limitations period applicable to any Return,
which period (after giving effect to such extension or waiver) has not yet
expired.   (g) There is no action, suit or proceeding now pending and
no claim, audit or investigation now pending of which the Company is aware

of its Subsidiaries are not a "United States real property holding
corporation" within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code.   25   
30   (i) Neither the Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any

has filed a consent pursuant to Section 341(f) of the Code concerning
collapsible corporations.   (j) There are no material liens for Taxes upon
the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except liens for
current Taxes not yet due.   (k) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to include any adjustment in taxable income for
any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date (a "POST-
CLOSING TAX PERIOD") under Section 481(c) of the Code (or any similar
provision of the Tax Laws of any jurisdiction) as a result of a change in
method of accounting for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or pursuant to the
provisions of any agreement entered into with any Taxing Authority with
regard to the Tax liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.   (l) Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group whereby any income, revenues, receipts, gain or loss was
determined or taken into account for Tax purposes with reference to or in
conjunction with any income, revenues, receipts, gain, loss, asset or
liability of any other entity other than a group of which the Company was the
parent.   (m) No claim has been made in writing by a Tax Authority in
a jurisdiction where neither the Company nor any Subsidiary files Returns
that the Company or any Subsidiary is subject to taxation in that
jurisdiction.   Section 4.15 REAL PROPERTY.   (a) SCHEDULE 4.15(a) of the

to the Purchaser true and complete copies of the leases of the Leased Real
Property set forth on SCHEDULE 4.15(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. No option,
extension or renewal has been exercised under any lease of the Leased Real
Property (the "LEASES") except options, extensions or renewals whose exercise
has been evidenced by a written document, a true and complete copy of which
has been made available to the Purchaser with the corresponding Lease. Each
of the Company and its Subsidiaries has complied in all material respects
with the terms of all Leases to which it is a party and under which it is in
occupancy, and all such Leases are in full force and effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys peaceful and undisturbed possession under
all such Leases, except where a failure to do so, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have or result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect.    26  31   (c) None of the Owned Real Property
or Leased Real Property is subject to any pledges, claims, liens, options,
charges, easements, restrictions, covenants, conditions of record,
encroachments, encumbrances and security interests of any kind or nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise)
(collectively, "LIENS") other than Liens that do not, individually or in the

patents owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are valid and
enforceable and any patent issuing from any patent applications of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be valid and enforceable, except as

infringements by any other party of any of the Intellectual Property Rights.
Except as disclosed on SCHEDULE 4.16 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no

would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or
with respect to Wynn Oil and the Wynn Oil Subsidiaries, an Oil Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 4.17 CONTRACTS.   (a) Other than the contracts

action designed or reasonably likely to facilitate, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes or reasonably may give rise to, an
Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided, that, at any time prior to the
date on which Merger Sub accepts the Shares for payment under the terms of
the Offer (the "OFFER COMPLETION DATE"), the Company Board of Directors may,
in the exercise of its fiduciary obligations under Delaware Law as determined
by the Company Board of Directors in good faith, after consultation with its
outside counsel (who may be its regularly engaged outside counsel) in
response to an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, make such inquiries
of the party making such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal as may be necessary
to inform itself of the proposed terms and details of the Acquisition
Proposal and, if the Board of Directors reasonably believes that such
Acquisition Proposal may lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined below)
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement with terms not more
favorable to such third party than the Confidentiality Agreement (excluding
the standstill provisions contained therein), furnish information to, and
negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, the third party who
delivers such Acquisition Proposal. As used herein, (i) "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"
means an Acquisition Proposal (A) that the Company Board of
Directors determines in its good faith judgment after consulting with and
receipt of advice from J.P. Morgan and Co., Incorporated (or any other

the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any adjustment to the
terms and conditions proposed by the Purchaser in response to such
Acquisition Proposal), (B) that is made by a Person reasonably capable of
completing such Acquisition Proposal, taking into account the legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of such Acquisition Proposal and the Person
making such Acquisition Proposal, and (C) for which financing, to the extent
required, is then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Company, is reasonably capable of being obtained by the
Person making the Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to any (A) direct or

more of the net revenues or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole, or (D) any merger, consolidation, business combination,

Except as expressly permitted by this SECTION 5.2(b), neither the Company

any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) cause or authorize the Company to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or

prior to the Offer Completion Date, the Company Board of Directors receives a
Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated, facilitated or
encouraged in violation of the terms of this Agreement and did not otherwise
result from a breach of this Agreement, the Company Board of Directors may
(subject to this and the following sentences) in the exercise of its
fiduciary obligations under Delaware Law as determined by the Company Board
of Directors in good faith, after consultation with its outside counsel (who

this Agreement or (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, a Superior Proposal or (iii) subject to SECTION 8.2(b), cause
the Company to enter into an Acquisition Agreement, provided, that the
Company simultaneously terminates this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
8.1(d)(iii); in each case, provided that (A) the Company gives the Purchaser
four Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action
(provided that the foregoing shall in no way limit or otherwise affect the
Purchaser\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to SECTION
8.1(f)), (B) during such four Business Day period, the Company otherwise
cooperates with the Purchaser with respect to the Acquisition Proposal that
constitutes a Superior Proposal with the intent of enabling the Purchaser to
engage in good faith negotiations so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated and (C) at the end of such four Business Day period
the Company Board of Directors continues reasonably to believe that the
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal. Any withdrawal or
modification of the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors of the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement shall not change the approval of the
Company Board of Directors for purposes of causing any "takeover statute" or
other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger.   (c) From and after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar
day) advise the Purchaser in writing of (i) the receipt,    35

Person is considering making an Acquisition Proposal (including the specific
terms thereof and the identity of the other party or parties involved), (ii)
any determination by the Company Board of Directors as to any Acquisition
Proposal as contemplated by the proviso to the second sentence of SECTION
5.2(a), and (iii) any discussions or negotiations with any party making an
Acquisition Proposal (or its representatives) relating to such Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but in any event within one calendar
day) furnish to the Purchaser a copy of any written proposals relating to a
possible Acquisition Proposal and copies of any written information provided
to or by any third party relating thereto to the extent such information has
not previously been provided to the Purchaser. The Company shall promptly
(but in any event within one calendar day) advise the Purchaser in writing of
any material changes to the terms and conditions of any Acquisition
Proposal.   (d) Nothing contained in this SECTION 5.2 shall prohibit
the Company from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside counsel (who may
be its regularly engaged outside counsel) that failure to do so would result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties to stockholders under Delaware Law,
provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof may, except as expressly permitted by
SECTION 5.2 or required by Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, withdraw or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, its position with respect
to the Offer, this Agreement or the Merger or approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal.   Section
5.3 COMPANY RIGHTS AGREEMENT. The Company Board of Directors will take all
further action (in addition to that referred to in SECTION 4.23) reasonably
requested in writing by the Purchaser in order to render the Company Rights
Agreement inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   ARTICLE VI  ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

stockholders, the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Statement shall contain the
recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that stockholders of the
Company approve and adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and the other

information provided by the Purchaser continues to be accurate. If at any
time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting any event or circumstance
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, or its or
their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company
that is required to be set forth in a supplement to the Proxy Statement, the

efforts to solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies in favor of the
Merger and shall take all other action necessary or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Purchaser, advisable to secure any vote or consent of
stockholders required by Delaware Law to effect the Merger. The
Purchaser agrees that it shall vote, or cause to be voted, in favor of the
Merger all Shares directly or indirectly beneficially owned by it.   (b)
Notwithstanding SECTION 6.2(a) hereof, in the event that the Purchaser,
Merger Sub or any Subsidiary of the Purchaser acquires at least 90% of the

Representatives to whom such documents were furnished promptly to return such
documents and any copies thereof any of them may have made, other than
documents filed with the SEC or otherwise publicly available.   Section 6.6
PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The Purchaser and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to the Offer or the Merger and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement before

Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions and to do or cause to be done all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and third parties, (ii) effect all necessary
registrations and filings under the Exchange Act and the Competition Laws,
(iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental
Authority vacated or reversed and (iv) execute and deliver any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. The parties shall cooperate
in responding to inquiries from, and making presentations to, regulatory
authorities. For purposes of this Agreement, "commercially
reasonable efforts" shall not be deemed to require either Purchaser or Merger
Sub to take actions in connection with any Competition Laws under clause
(iii) above except in its sole discretion or to agree to, or proffer to,
divest or hold separate any assets or any portion of any business of
Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries.    38  43   Section 6.8 AGREEMENT TO DEFEND AND
INDEMNIFY.   (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers, employees and
agents of the Company or each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") as provided in their respective certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) will be
assumed by the Purchaser and the Purchaser will be directly responsible for
such indemnification, without further action, as of the Effective Time and
will continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective
terms. From and after the Effective Time and for a period of not less than
six years thereafter, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless any and all Indemnified Parties
to the full extent such persons may be indemnified by the Company or such
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, pursuant to applicable law, their
respective certificates or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or other
organizational documents) or pursuant to indemnification agreements as
in effect on the date of this Agreement for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time. In addition, from and after the Effective Time,
directors and officers of the Company who become or remain directors or
officers of the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to
the same indemnity rights and protections (including those provided by
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance) of the Purchaser.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the provisions of this SECTION
6.8 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and
(ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.   (b) The Purchaser will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect for not less than six years after the
Effective Time policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
equivalent in all material respects to those maintained by or on behalf of
the Company and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof (and having at least the
same coverage and containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the Persons currently covered by such policies as insured)
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, provided, however, that if the aggregate annual premiums for such
insurance at any time during such period exceed 200% of the per annum rate of
premium currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance
on the date of this Agreement, then the Purchaser will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation will, provide the maximum
coverage that is then available at an annual premium equal to 200% of such
rate.   (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this SECTION 6.8.   Section
6.9 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. (a) The Company shall adopt such amendments to the
Company Benefit Plans as reasonably requested by the Purchaser and as may be
necessary to ensure that Company Benefit Plans cover only employees
and former employees (and their    39  44  dependents and
beneficiaries) of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect
to any shares held by any Company Benefit Plan as of the date of this
Agreement or thereafter, the Company shall take all actions necessary
or appropriate (including such actions as are reasonably requested by
the Purchaser) to ensure that all participant voting procedures contained in
the Company Benefit Plans relating to such Shares, and all applicable
provisions of ERISA, are complied with in all material respects.   (b)
Purchaser shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries (or their successors)
to continue to provide, for a period of one year following the Effective
Time, compensation and benefits which are, in the aggregate, substantially
comparable to the compensation and benefits provided to the employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time. At all
times following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause each of the
employee benefit plans and programs covering individuals who were
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time to
recognize service performed as an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary
prior to the Effective Time. Such service shall be recognized for purposes of
determining such individuals\' eligibility, vesting and rate of benefit
accrual, but Purchaser shall not be required to cause such plans or programs
to credit such individuals with benefits for services performed prior to the
Effective Time.   (c) Purchaser shall cause any successor to the Company
resulting from the transactions contemplated herein to adopt the 1998
Supplemental Retirement Income Plan of the Company and its Subsidiaries so
that payment of the benefits earned by participants in such plan up to the
Effective Time shall not be accelerated.   Section 6.10 TRANSFER TAXES. The
Purchaser and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, applications or other documents regarding any Transfer
Taxes, real property transfer, stamp, recording, documentary or other Taxes
(including, without limitation, any state real estate transfer Taxes) and any
other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Merger (collectively, "TRANSFER TAXES"). The Purchaser shall pay or cause to
be paid, without deduction or withholding from any amounts payable to the
holders of Shares, all Transfer Taxes.   ARTICLE VII  CONDITIONS TO THE
MERGER   Section 7.1 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF EACH PARTY TO EFFECT THE
MERGER. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall
be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each of the
following conditions (any or all of which may be waived by the parties hereto

Law):   (a) Merger Sub shall have made, or caused to be made, the Offer

effect the Merger if Merger Sub fails to accept for payment or pay for Shares
pursuant to the Offer in violation of the terms of the Offer or of this
Agreement.    40  45   (b) If required by Delaware Law, the Merger and
this Agreement shall have been approved and adopted by the requisite vote of
the stockholders of the Company.   (c) No statute, rule, regulation,
judgment, writ, decree, order or injunction (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) shall have been promulgated, enacted, entered or enforced, and
no other action shall have been taken, by any government or governmental,
administrative or regulatory authority or by any court of competent
jurisdiction, that in any of the foregoing cases has the effect of making
illegal or restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or materially
restricting the consummation of the Merger; provided that this condition
shall be deemed to have been satisfied with respect to the obligation of the
Purchaser and Merger Sub to effect the Merger if the Purchaser\'s or Merger
Sub\'s failure to comply with its obligations under SECTION 6.7 materially
contributed to the issuance of any such judgment, writ, decree, order or
injunction.   Section 7.2 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF THE PURCHASER AND
MERGER SUB TO EFFECT THE MERGER. The obligations of the Purchaser and Merger
Sub to effect the Merger shall be further subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the following condition prior to the Effective Time:   (a) The
Company shall have performed in all material respects all of its obligations
hereunder required to be performed by it at or prior to the Effective
Time.   ARTICLE VIII  TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER   Section 8.1

additional information but in no event later than December 15, 2000);

consummated on or before said date; or    41  46   (d) By the Company
