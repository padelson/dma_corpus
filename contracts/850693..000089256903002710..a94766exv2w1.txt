Agreement exclusively for the purpose of reimbursing the Securityholders'
Representative for the Securityholders' Representative's Costs. Except for funds
that may be withdrawn by the Securityholders' Representative and funds that may
be distributed in accordance with the Expenses Escrow Agreement, the Expenses
Escrow Amount shall be held by the Escrow Agent until such time as the Expenses
Escrow Agreement is terminated (the "Expenses Escrow End Date"). Any remaining
portion of the Expenses Escrow Amount shall be released to the Securityholders
in accordance with the terms of the Expenses Escrow Agreement on the Expenses
Escrow End Date. Neither Parent nor the Company shall be a party to or have any


                                       4
<PAGE>
liability pursuant to the Expenses Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in Article 8 hereof, the Securityholders shall indemnify, save and
hold Parent and its directors, officers, employees, successors, transferees and
assignees, and its Representatives harmless from all Damages incurred or
suffered in connection with, arising out of, resulting from the establishment or
funding of the escrow pursuant this Section 2.2(b).

                  (c) Transfer of Funds to Exchange Agent. On the Closing Date,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with an exchange agent selected by
Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in
trust for the benefit of Securityholders, an amount equal to (i) the Total
Merger Consideration, less (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount, less (iii)
the Expenses Escrow Amount, less (iv) the exercise price of any vested Company
Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Out-of-Money Company Options, less (iv) the exercise price of any Company
Warrants outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than
Out-of-Money Company Warrants (the amount calculated pursuant to the foregoing
(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any purpose other than as contemplated by Section 2.3 hereof.

                  (d) Post-Closing True Up. As soon as practicable after the
date that is thirty-five (35) days after (but in no event more than sixty (60)
days after) the date on which the Company mails the notice required by Section
1301(a) of the CCC to the Shareholders (such date, the "Initial True Up Date"),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay (or, following termination of the
Exchange Fund, Parent shall pay) to each Securityholder that is not a Dissenting
Shareholder as of the Initial True Up Date an amount equal to the positive
difference, if any, of (i) the amount that would be payable to such
Securityholder under Section 2.1 and Section 2.5 on the Initial True Up Date if
the Effective Time had occurred on the Initial True Up Date less (ii) the amount
payable to such Securityholder under Section 2.1 and Section 2.5 as of the
Effective Time. As soon as practicable after each Subsequent True Up Date, if,
at any time since the prior True Up Date, a Shareholder shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost (through failure to perfect or otherwise) its rights to
receive payment for the fair market value of a Dissenting Share under the CCC,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay (or, following termination of the
Exchange Fund, Parent shall pay) to each Securityholder who is not a Dissenting
Shareholder as of such Subsequent True Up Date an amount equal to the positive
difference, if any, of (i) the amount that would be payable to such
Securityholder under Section 2.1 and Section 2.5 on such Subsequent True Up Date
if the Effective Time had occurred on such Subsequent True Up Date less (ii) the
sum of (A) the amount payable to such Securityholder under Section 2.1 and
Section 2.5 as of the Effective Time and (B) the amount payable to such
Securityholder on each prior True Up Date under this Section 2.2(d).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on any True Up Date, the amount payable to a
Securityholder shall be less than $100 (including any amounts carried deferred
pursuant to this sentence), then Parent shall be entitled to defer payment of
such amount until the date on which payments are made following the next True Up
Date or, if sooner, promptly following the earlier of (X) the date on which all
Shareholders shall have effectively withdrawn or lost (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) their rights to receive payment for the fair market value
of a Dissenting Share under the CCC or (Y) the date on which Parent would not be
obligated to pay additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.2(d) in excess of
$5,000 (the "Final True Up Date"), provided, however, that in no event shall the
Escrow Agent or Parent be required to make a


                                       5
<PAGE>
payment to a Securityholder in an amount that is less than $10. Each payment to
be made to the Securityholders shall be payable by check mailed to the
applicable Securityholder's address as may be set forth in Exhibit B to the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement on the date of such payment. In no event shall
this Section 2.2(d) be read to require Parent to make payments under this
Agreement in excess of the Total Merger Consideration.

            2.3 Exchange of Certificates, Notes, Options and Warrants;
Submission of Letter of Transmittal.

                  (a) Effect of Merger on Certificates and Company Convertible
Notes. From and after the Effective Time, all Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Stock or (ii) a Company
Convertible Note that has been converted into Series B-1 Preferred Stock but for
which no certificate representing such shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock has
been issued (the certificate representing outstanding shares of Company Stock
and the Company Convertible Note along with evidence of its conversion
collectively being referred to herein as the "Certificates") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except holders of such Certificates shall have
the right, upon (except as provided in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b)) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of Certificates for cancellation, to receive in exchange
therefor the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares represented by the Certificates so surrendered, and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate
purposes, to evidence only the right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the shares represented by such Certificate.

                  (b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of a Certificate of record as of the close of business on the Closing Date and
to each Optionholder and Warrant Holder as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter
of transmittal which shall (1) specify that delivery of the Per Share Merger
Consideration, the Option Consideration or the Warrant Consideration, as the
case may be, shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the
Certificates, Company Options or Company Warrants shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of (A) in the case of Shareholders, the Certificates, (B) in the case
of Optionholders, the Company Options held by such Optionholder as evidenced by
the stock option agreement(s) between the Company and such Optionholder and (C)
in the case of Warrant Holders, the Company Warrants held by such Warrant Holder
as evidenced by the warrant agreement(s) between the Company and such Warrant
Holder, (2) provide for the consent of such Securityholder to the appointment of
the Securityholders' Representative on the terms and subject to the provisions
of Section 8.6 and (3) be accompanied by an IRS Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN (or
suitable substitute form) as required by Section 6.8(h); and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of such Certificates, Company Options or Company
Warrants in exchange for the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, Option
Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as applicable, less such
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and such
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion of the Expenses Escrow Amount. Upon surrender
of a Certificate, the Company Options or the Company Warrants, as the case may
be, to the Exchange


                                       6
<PAGE>
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal and the Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN
(or suitable substitute form), each duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, such Securityholder shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the cash that such
Securityholder has the right to receive pursuant to Sections 2.1 and 2.5,
reduced by amounts deposited on behalf of such Securityholder with the Escrow
Agent pursuant to Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b), rounded to the nearest cent (with
amounts greater than or equal to $0.005 rounded up); provided, however, that, in
lieu of receiving a check, any Securityholder entitled to receive in excess of
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in the aggregate pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2.3(b) shall be entitled to elect to receive all, but
not less than all, of any payment to be made to such Securityholder by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to an account of such Securityholder
designated in writing by such Securityholder to the Exchange Agent by delivering
to the Exchange Agent a written request for payment by wire transfer. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to this
Section 2.3(b).

                  (c) Further Rights in Company Stock. The Per Share Merger
Consideration, Option Consideration or Warrant Consideration issued upon
conversion of a share of Company Stock or issued in respect of a Company
Convertible Note, Company Option or Company Warrant, respectively, in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such share of Company Stock, such Company
Convertible Note, such Company Option or such Company Warrant, respectively,
except the right to receive any disbursements from the Indemnification Escrow
Fund and the Expenses Escrow Fund in accordance with the provisions of the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement and Expenses Escrow Agreement, respectively.

                  (d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund which remains undistributed to the Securityholders for nine months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent and, from
and after such delivery to Parent, any Securityholders who have not theretofore
complied with this Article 2 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, Option Consideration or Warrant
Consideration payable in respect of each share of Company Stock, each Company
Convertible Note, each Company Option or each Company Warrant, without any
interest thereon.

                  (e) No Liability. Neither Parent nor the Company shall be
liable to any Securityholder for any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

                  (f) Lost Certificates, Company Options and Company Warrants.
If any Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon (i) the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and (ii) the execution and delivery of an agreement, in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to indemnify Parent against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, Company Option or
Company Warrant, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant the applicable Per
Share Merger Consideration, Option


                                       7
<PAGE>
Consideration or Warrant Consideration, as the case may be, payable in respect
of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, Company Option
or Company Warrant, as the case may be, without any interest thereon (subject to
any amount to be paid into the Indemnification Escrow Fund and the Expenses
Escrow Fund in respect of the shares represented by such Certificate, Company
Option or Company Warrant); provided, however, that, with respect to any such
Certificate, Company Option or Company Warrant which is exchangeable pursuant to
Section 2.1 or Section 2.5 for an amount in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000), if required by Parent, such Person shall also post a bond, in
such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent with respect to such Certificate, Company Option or
Company Warrant.

                  (g) Withholding. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Securityholder such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any Tax
Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Securityholder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent or the Exchange Agent.

                  (h) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall
invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, in
interest-bearing savings accounts, certificates of deposit, short-term U.S.
Treasury funds or money market funds on a daily basis. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent upon termination
of the Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.3(d).

            2.4 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Stock theretofore outstanding on
the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificates except as otherwise provided
herein or by applicable Law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares
of Company Stock represented by such Certificates, without any interest thereon.

            2.5 Stock Options. Section 2.5 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets
forth each Company Option that is vested immediately prior to the Effective Time
or that will vest automatically in accordance with its terms prior to or upon
the Effective Time (collectively, the "Vested Company Options"). At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of Company Options, the Company
Options shall terminate and be cancelled and, in exchange for each Vested
Company Option, each former holder of a Vested Company Option shall be entitled
to receive an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash equal
to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration
relating to the Company Common Stock or Series B-1 Preferred Stock subject to
such Company Option, over the per share exercise price of Company Common Stock
or Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable, subject at the Effective Time to
such Vested Company Option and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
or


                                       8
<PAGE>
Series B-1 Preferred Stock, as applicable subject to such Vested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amounts payable hereunder being
referred to as the "Option Consideration"). From and after the Effective Time,
any such cancelled Vested Company Option shall no longer be exercisable but
shall only entitle the Optionholder to the payment of the Option Consideration.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain consents necessary, if any, to ensure that former
Optionholders will have no rights other than the right to receive the Option
Consideration. At, or as soon as practicable after receipt of the documents
required to be delivered by an Optionholder pursuant to Section 2.3, Parent
shall or shall cause the Exchange Agent to provide to such Optionholder whose
Company Options are validly cancelled pursuant to this Section 2.5 with a lump
sum cash payment equal to the Option Consideration payable to such Optionholder
pursuant to this Section 2.5 in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3.
With respect to any other Company Option, such Company Option shall terminate if
not exercised at or prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, all
stock option plans, agreement or arrangements of the Company shall be terminated
and no further Company Options shall be granted thereunder.

            2.6 Dissenting Shares.

                  (a) Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares ("Dissenting Shares") of Company Stock
held by a Shareholder ("Dissenting Shareholder") that may exercise such holder's
dissenter's rights in accordance with Section 1300 of the CCC, and who does not
effectively withdraw or lose such dissenter's rights, shall not be converted
into or represent a right to receive the applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, but the Dissenting Shareholder shall only
be entitled to such rights as are granted by Section 1300 of the CCC.

                  (b) Loss of Dissenters' Rights. Notwithstanding the provisions
of Section 2.6(a), if any Dissenting Shareholder shall effectively withdraw or
lose (through failure to perfect or otherwise) its rights to receive payment for
the fair market value of a Dissenting Share under the CCC, then, as of the later
of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, such Dissenting Share
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest, upon (except as
provided in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b)) surrender of the Certificates
representing such shares to Parent pursuant to Section 2.3.

                  (c) Notice. The Company shall (i) comply with the requirements
of Section 1300 of the CCC, (ii) give Parent prompt notice of any written
demands for payment with respect to capital stock of the Company pursuant to
Section 1300 of the CCC, of withdrawals of such demands, and copies of any
documents or instruments served pursuant to the CCC and received by the Company,
and (iii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters' rights under the CCC. Any
payment made by the Company with respect to any demands for dissenters' rights
with respect to Company capital stock that is in excess of the amount a
Shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 shall
be treated in accordance with Section 2.6(d) below.

                  (d) Excess Payment. Any amount paid by Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation to any Dissenting Shareholder for Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section


                                       9
<PAGE>
1300 of the CCC in excess of the value such Dissenting Shareholder would have
received in the Merger for such Dissenting Shares (such amount, unless
determined in a final non-appealable judgment of a court, being subject to the
written approval of the Securityholders' Representative, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld), and all reasonable costs, expenses and fees as
incurred by the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation in connection with
the exercise of a Dissenting Shareholder's right under Section 1300 of the CCC,
shall constitute "Excess Payments." The parties hereto agree that the amount of
the Excess Payments shall constitute "Damages" for purposes of this Agreement
and Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall, without
limiting any other rights, be entitled to recover such amount from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund.

                                    ARTICLE 3

Parent and Merger Sub that the statements in this Article 3 are true and correct
and will also be true and correct as of the Closing Date as though made as of
the Closing Date and as though the Closing Date were substituted for the date of
this Agreement throughout this Article 3; provided, however, that no
representation or warranty shall be deemed untrue or incorrect if such
representation or warranty was true and correct as of the date hereof and
becomes untrue or incorrect after the date hereof directly or indirectly as a
result of action taken by the Company after the date hereof, which action was
taken by the Company upon Parent's written consent, at Parent's written

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has the requisite power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failure to have such power, authority and governmental approvals could

Material Adverse Effect.

capital stock of or other voting securities or Equity Interests in any other
Person.

            3.3 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws; Corporate Books and
Records. Section 3.3 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true, correct

before any Governmental Entity. To the Company's knowledge, no employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary are in any material respect in violation of
any term of any agreement with, or any restrictive covenant to, a former

in violation thereof.

            (m)   The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and

currently is the beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any
Tax Return. No claim has ever been made by a Tax authority in a jurisdiction
where any of the Company and its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that it
is or may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

            (b)   Payment of Taxes. The unpaid Taxes of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries (i) did not, as of the dates of the Interim Financial
Statements, exceed the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet (rather than in any
notes thereto), and (ii) will not exceed that reserve as adjusted for operations
and transactions through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in filing their Tax
Returns. Since December 31, 2002, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has incurred any liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or
otherwise inconsistent with past custom and practice. For purposes of this
representation, Taxes shall be allocated in the manner set forth in the last
sentence in Section 6.8(b); provided, however, that Taxes for Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be determined
without regard to any items of deduction, loss or credit of the Company
attributable to the effectuation of the Merger, to the extent paid directly or
indirectly by Parent. For purposes of indemnification by the Company
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 8.2(a)(i), the representations and
warranties set forth in this Section 3.18(b) shall be read without regard to any
exceptions to such representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.18(b)
of the Company Disclosure Letter.

            (c)   Audits, Investigations or Claims. No deficiencies for Taxes
with respect to any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have been
claimed or proposed in writing or assessed by a Tax authority. There are no
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened audits, assessments or other
actions for or relating to any liability in respect of Taxes of any of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no matters under discussion with
any Tax Authority, or known to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, with
respect to Taxes that are likely to result in an additional liability for Taxes
with respect to any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company has
delivered or made available to Parent complete and accurate copies of federal,
state and local income Tax Returns of each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and their predecessors for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1999,
2000, 2001, and 2002, and complete and accurate copies of all examination
reports and statements of deficiencies assessed against or agreed to by any of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or any predecessors since December 31,
1998, with respect to Taxes of any type. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries nor any predecessor has waived any statute of limitations
in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with respect to a Tax
assessment or deficiency, nor has any request been made in writing for any such
extension or waiver. No power of attorney (other than powers of attorney
authorizing employees


                                       29
<PAGE>
of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries to act on behalf of the Company or
such Company Subsidiaries, respectively) with respect to any Taxes has been
executed or filed with any Tax authority.

            (d)   Liens. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the assets of any of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (other than with respect to Permitted
Liens for Taxes).

            (e)   No Withholding. None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has been a United States real property holding corporation within the meaning of
Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the applicable period specified in Section
897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
has withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party.

            (f)   Other Entity Liability. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has any liability for the Taxes of any other Person (other than the
Company and any Company Subsidiary) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502 - 6
(or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign Law), as a transferee, by
Contract, or otherwise. None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been
a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return
(other than a group the common parent of which is the Company). For purposes of
indemnification by the Company Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(i), the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.18(f)
shall be read without regard to any exceptions to such representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.18(f) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

            (g)   Tax Sharing Agreements. There are no Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements (including indemnity arrangements) with respect to or
involving any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and, after the
Closing Date, none of the Company nor the Company Subsidiaries shall be bound by
any such Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

            (h)   Spin-Offs. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
distributed the stock of any corporation in a transaction satisfying the
requirements of Section 355 of the Code since April 16, 1997, and neither the
stock of the Company nor the stock of any Company Subsidiary has been
distributed in a transaction satisfying the requirements of Section 355 of the
Code since April 16, 1997.

            (i)   Tax Elections. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
(i) has consented at any time under former Section 341(f)(1) of the Code to have
the provisions of former Section 341(f)(2) of the Code apply to any disposition
of the assets of any of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; (ii) has agreed,
or is required, to make any adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code for any

            (j)   Partnerships, Single Member LLCs, CFCs, PHCs, and PFICs.
Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary (i) is a partner for Tax purposes
with respect to any joint venture, partnership, or other arrangement or Contract
which is treated as a partnership for Tax purposes, (ii) owns a single member

provision of state, local or foreign Law), or (v) is a "passive foreign
investment company" within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code.

            (k)   Permanent Establishments. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has or has had a permanent establishment in any foreign country, as
defined in any applicable Tax treaty or convention between the United States of
America and such foreign country.

            (l)   Disallowance of Interest Deductions. None of the outstanding
indebtedness of any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries constitutes
indebtedness with respect to which any interest deductions may be disallowed
under Sections 163(i) or 163(l) or 279 of the Code or under any other provision
of applicable law.

            (m)   International Boycotts. None of the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has ever participated in and are not participating in an

            (n)   Tax Shelters. None of the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has entered into any transaction identified as a "listed transaction" for
purposes of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.6011-4(b)(2) or
301.6111-2(b)(2). If any of the Company or Company Subsidiary has entered into
any transaction such that, if the treatment claimed by it were to be disallowed,
the transaction would constitute a substantial understatement of federal income
tax within the meaning of Code Section 6662, then it believes that it has either
(x) substantial authority for the tax treatment of such transaction or (y)
disclosed on its Tax Return the relevant facts affecting the tax treatment of
such transaction.

      3.19  Insurance. Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true and complete list of all insurance policies held by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. True and complete copies of all such insurance policies have
been provided or made available by the Company to Parent. All premiums due to
the date hereof on such insurance policies have been paid. The Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have not failed to give any notice or present any claim
under any such insurance policies in a timely fashion, except where such failure
would not prejudice the Company's or a Company Subsidiary's ability to make a
material claim. Such insurance policies to the date hereof have (i) been
maintained in full force and effect


                                       31
<PAGE>
and (ii) not been cancelled or changed, except to extend the maturity dates
thereof. No notice of cancellation or termination has been received with respect
to any such insurance policies. During the past three years, neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary has been refused any insurance with respect to any
aspect of operations of its business, nor has its coverage been rescinded by any
insurance carrier to which it has applied for insurance or with which it has
carried insurance. The activities and operations of the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have been conducted in a manner so as to conform to all material

title to or a valid leasehold interest or other comparable Contract rights in or
relating to all of its properties and assets, whether tangible or intangible,
real or personal, necessary for the conduct of its business as currently
conducted, except for properties and assets the loss of which would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

            (b)   Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiaries owns any real
property. Section 3.20(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all real
property leased by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

            (c)   Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in
possession of the properties or assets purported to be leased under all of its

that has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result (with or without the
giving of notice, the lapse of time or both) in a default with respect to any
material lease or sublease to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company, and the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby, will not affect the enforceability against any
Person of any such lease agreement or the rights of the Company or each Company
Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation to the continued use and possession of
the real property subject to such leases for the conduct of business as
presently conducted.

any other Governmental Entity.

            (e)   Neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor to the
Company's knowledge, any Third Person, has at any time within the last three
years received any oral or written communication (including any warning letter,

pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened (including any prosecution,
injunction, seizure, civil fine, suspension, recall or any other action to place
restrictions on the production of any Pharmaceutical Product), in each case
alleging that the Company, any Company Subsidiary or (with respect to activities
conducted on behalf of the Company) a Third Person and its individual employees
or agents are not currently in compliance with any and all applicable Laws.

            (f)   As to the Pharmaceutical Products for which a premarket

included in the application, where required, the certification described in 21
U.S.C. Section 335a(k)(1) and the list described in 21 U.S.C. Section

committed any act, made any statement or failed to make any statement that would
reasonably be expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its policy with

expected to provide a basis for liability under the Federal Anti-Kickback
Statute or the Civil False Claims Act and any regulations promulgated

Additionally, neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary, nor, to the Company's

Noteholders' Consent which has become false or misleading.

            (b)   The Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to Section
6.1(a) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public

information, proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Transaction.

Representatives with access (including for the purpose of coordinating
integration activities and transition planning with the employees of the Company
and any Company Subsidiary), at reasonable times and upon prior notice to the
Company, to all of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' properties,
books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records, and the Company shall

information concerning its and any Company Subsidiary's properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, personnel and records as Parent may reasonably request.
No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) shall affect or be
deemed to modify or limit any representation or warranty made in this Agreement.

            (b)   With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to this
Section 6.2, Parent shall comply with, and shall cause its and its Affiliates'
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
confidentiality provisions of that certain letter agreement, dated August 25,
2003, previously executed by the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"); provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth herein or in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to
which the parties hereto are parties or by which they are bound (including the
Confidentiality Agreement), the parties acknowledge and agree that any
obligations of confidentiality contained herein and therein shall not apply to

specific information about any party's intellectual property or other
proprietary assets) unless such information may be related or relevant to the
tax treatment or tax structure of such transaction and (ii) notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, this Section 6.2(b) contains no restrictions on

transaction or to disclose the tax treatment or tax structure of any transaction
to federal and state taxing authorities.

      6.3   No Solicitation of Competing Transactions.

            (a)   The Company agrees it shall not, and it shall cause the
Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Affiliates and Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, encourage, take any
action to facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to, or the making,
submission or announcement of, any proposal or offer (including any proposal or

Transaction, (iii) participate in or engage in discussions or negotiations with
any Person with respect to any Competing Transaction, except to notify such
Person as to the existence of these provisions, (iv) approve, endorse or

<PAGE>
similar document or any agreement, commitment or understanding contemplating or
otherwise relating to any Competing Transaction or a transaction contemplated
thereby. To the extent they have not previously done so, the Company shall and
it shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective Affiliates
and Representatives to immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to a Competing Transaction. The Company shall and shall cause each Company
Subsidiary to not release any third party from, or waive any provision of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it is a party.

            (b)   Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any
violation of the restrictions set forth in Section 6.3(a) by any Representative
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
otherwise, shall be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company.

            (c)   As promptly as practicable, and in any event within twenty -
four hours, after receipt of any inquiry, any request for information, or the
making of any proposal or offer that could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Competing Transaction, the Company shall provide Parent with oral and written
notice of the material terms and conditions of such inquiry, request, proposal
or offer and the identity of the Person or group making any such inquiry,
request, proposal or offer, a copy of all written materials provided in
connection with such inquiry, request, proposal or offer and a written summary
of any such inquiry, request, proposal or offer, if it is not in writing. After
receipt of the inquiry, request, proposal or offer, the Company shall continue
to provide Parent prompt oral and written notice setting forth all such
information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent informed in all material
respects of the status and details (including material amendments or proposed
material amendments) of any such inquiry, request, proposal or offer and shall
promptly provide to Parent a copy of all written materials subsequently provided
in connection with such inquiry, request, proposal or offer and a summary of all
oral proposals, requests or inquiries.

      6.4   Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

            (a)   Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities) and the taking of all steps as may necessary to obtain all necessary
actions, consents, approvals or waivers from, or to avoid an action or
proceeding by, any Governmental Entity and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under (A)
the HSR Act and antitrust and competition Laws of any other applicable
jurisdiction and (B) any other applicable Law and (iii) the obtaining of all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not, without Parent's prior written consent, commit
to any divestitures or licenses or agree to hold separate any assets or agree to
any similar arrangements or commit to conduct


                                       48
<PAGE>
its business in a specified manner (or allow any Company Subsidiary to commit to
any divestitures or licenses or agree to hold separate any assets or agree to
any similar arrangements) in order to obtain such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to (with respect to Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or with
respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary) commit to any divestitures or
licenses or agree to hold separate any assets or agree to any similar
arrangements or commit to conduct its business in a specified manner.

            (b)   In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, within
five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, the Company and Parent shall duly
file with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice the notification and report form (the "HSR Filing")
required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The HSR Filing shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall cooperate with the other party to
the extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation of its HSR
Filing, to request early termination of the waiting period required by the HSR
Act and, if requested, to promptly amend or furnish additional information
thereunder.

            (c)   The Company and the Board of Directors of the Company shall
(i) take all commercially reasonable action necessary to ensure that no state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (ii) if any state takeover statute or similar statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, take all commercially reasonable action
necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such
statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

            (d)   Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall
each use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any decree, order, or judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing, on or before the Outside Date, including defending
through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any court by any person;
and

            (e)   The Company shall give (or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
give), and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Company in providing, notices to third parties, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Company to obtain, third party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) required to be
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter or (iii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective
Time or a Parent Material Adverse Effect from occurring after the Effective
Time. In the event that the Company shall fail to obtain any third party consent
described in the first sentence of this Section 6.4(e), the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by


                                       49
<PAGE>
Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their
respective Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or which
could reasonably be expected to result after the Effective Time, from the
failure to obtain such consent.

            (f)   From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing of any pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened action, suit, arbitration or other
proceeding or investigation by any Governmental Entity or any other person (i)
challenging or seeking damages in connection with the Merger or (ii) seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or otherwise limit the right
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to own or operate all or any portion of the
businesses or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and shall,
subject to fiduciary duties, defend of any such action or other legal
proceedings, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order
entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed.

      6.5   Public Announcements. Parent and the Company will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and make
reasonable comment upon, any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except
as may be required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with the New York
Stock Exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation and the consent of the other party, not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that Parent may make any
public statement in response to specific questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or financial analyst
conference calls, so long as any such statements are not inconsistent with
previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by
Parent and the Company.

      6.6   Employee Benefit Matters.

            (a)   As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (the "Benefits
Date"), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, employee benefit plans,
programs and arrangements to employees of the Company that are the same as those
made generally available to similarly situated employees of Parent who are hired
by Parent after June 30, 2003. From the Effective Time to the Benefits Date
(which the parties acknowledge may occur on different dates with respect to
different plans, programs or arrangements of the Company) (the "Continuation
Period"), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, the employee benefit
plans, programs and arrangements of the Company that are provided to employees
of the Company as of the date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall enroll, or cause to be enrolled, employees of the Company who are employed
by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parent's 401(k) Plan, which enrollment
shall be effective as of the Effective Time.

            (b)   With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy
or arrangement maintained by Parent (the "Parent Plans") in which employees of
the Company subsequently participate, for purposes of determining vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), service with the Company
(or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provides past service
credit) shall be treated as service with Parent; provided, that such service

                                       50
<PAGE>
shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a
duplication of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized
under the applicable Company Benefit Plan. Such service also shall apply for
purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, evidence of insurability
requirements, or the application of any pre - existing condition limitations.
Each Parent Plan shall waive pre - existing condition limitations to the same
extent waived under the applicable Company Benefit Plan. Company employees shall
be given credit for amounts paid under a corresponding benefit plan during the
same period for purposes of applying deductibles, co - payments and out - of -
pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the Parent Plan for the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs.

            (c)   The Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans of the
Company, effective not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective
Time. The Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such 401(k) plan(s)
have been terminated pursuant to resolution of the Company's Board of Directors
(the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent) not later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

            (d)   The Company shall take all commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) obtain from each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treasury
Regulation 1.280G) with respect to the Company an agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to waive that portion of any
parachute payments payable to such individual that may be subject to excise
taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, provided that such waiver shall be
effective only if the required vote of Shareholders contemplated by clause (ii)
below is not obtained, and (ii) obtain approval by more than 75 percent of the
voting power of all outstanding stock of the Company in compliance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code of any payment of the amounts
waived pursuant to clause (i). In the absence of such Shareholder approval,
where Shareholder approval is sought, none of such payments and/or benefits
shall be paid to the extent waived by the applicable disqualified individual.

            (e)   No provision of this Agreement shall create any third - party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company, any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to
the compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any employee of the Company by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or under any benefit plan which Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
maintain.

      6.7   Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein with respect
to expenses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in excess of the
Transaction Fee Cap (which shall be an obligation of the Securityholders),
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such Expense; provided, however, that Parent and the Company
shall each be responsible for one - half of all filing fees required to be paid
in connection with the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act.

                                       51
<PAGE>
      6.8   Tax Matters.

            (a)   Tax Periods Ending on or before the Closing Date. Parent shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date on a basis consistent
with past practice, unless otherwise required by Law. Parent shall permit the
Securityholders' Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return
described in the preceding sentence prior to filing and shall make such
revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by the
Securityholders' Representative. Taxes for Tax periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date shall be determined without regard to any
items of deduction, loss or credit of the Company attributable to the
effectuation of the Merger, to the extent paid directly or indirectly by Parent.

            (b)   Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing
Date. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Tax Returns of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for Tax periods
which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date on a basis
consistent with past practice except (i) as otherwise required by Law or (ii) as
otherwise would result in a reduced amount of Tax. Taxes for Tax periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the Closing Date shall be determined
without regard to any items of deduction, loss or credit of the Company
attributable to the effectuation of the Merger, to the extent paid directly or
indirectly by Parent. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, in the case
of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such
Tax that relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date
shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Tax
period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in
the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based
upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would
by payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing Date.

            (c)   Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Securityholders' Representative and the Securityholders shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Agreement and any
audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit,
litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the
Securityholders' Representative and the Securityholders agree (A) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to each of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries relating to any Taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Parent, any extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Taxing authority, (B) to deliver or make available to Parent, within sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, copies of all such books and records, and (C) to
give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying

                                       52
<PAGE>
or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party so requests,
Parent, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, the Securityholders'
Representative and the Securityholders, as the case may be, shall allow the
other party to take possession of such books and records at such other party's
expense. Parent and the Securityholders' Representative further agree, upon
request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate
or other document from any Governmental Entity or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

            (d)   Contest Provisions. If, subsequent to the Closing, any of
Parent, the Company or the Company Subsidiaries receives notice of a Tax Contest
with respect to any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (a "Pre-Closing
Return"), then within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, Parent
shall notify the Securityholders' Representative of such notice. The
Securityholders' Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and
resolution of such Tax Contest, provided, however, that if any of the issues
raised in such Tax Contest could have an impact on Taxes of the Company for a
Tax period or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date (a
"Post-Closing Tax Period"), then the Securityholders' Representative shall
afford Parent the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of
the portion of such Tax Contest which could have an impact on Taxes of the
Company in any Post-Closing Tax Period; provided, further, that if the Company
Indemnifying Parties are not reasonably expected to fully indemnify Parent
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement for any Damages arising from such
Tax Contest, then the Securityholders' Representative shall afford Parent the
opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest.
If the Securityholders' Representative shall have the right to control the
conduct and resolution of such Tax Contest but elect in writing not to do so,
then Parent shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such
Tax Contest, provided that Parent shall keep the Securityholders' Representative
informed of all developments on a timely basis and Parent shall not resolve such
Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse
impact on the Company Indemnifying Parties' indemnification obligations under
this Agreement without the Securityholders' Representative written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each party shall bear its own costs
for participating in such Tax Contest.

            (e)   Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other substantially similar Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement
(collectively, "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Securityholders when due,
and the Securityholders will, at their own expense, file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and, if
required by applicable law, Parent will, and will cause its affiliates to, join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The
Securityholders shall (i) provide Parent with evidence satisfactory to Parent
that such Transfer Taxes have been paid by the Securityholders and (ii) use
their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Parent at Closing with a
clearance certificate or similar document(s) which may be required by any state
taxing authority to relieve Parent of any obligation to withhold any portion of
the payments to the Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement.

            (f)   Characterization of Payments. Any payments made to any Company
Indemnified Party or any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 8.2 shall

                                       53
<PAGE>
constitute an adjustment of the consideration paid for the Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, for
Tax purposes and shall be treated as such by the Company Indemnified Parties or
the Parent Indemnified Parties on their Tax Returns to the extent permitted by
law.

            (g)   Carrybacks. The parties agree and acknowledge that (i) any net
operating losses or similar Tax attribute of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is an asset of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that
(subject to any applicable limitations imposed by Law) is being acquired by
Parent pursuant to the Merger and (ii) for periods ending after the Closing
Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not elect to carryback any
such Tax attributes to Tax periods of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or otherwise act so as to limit the
ability of Parent to use such attributes subsequent to the Merger.

            (h)   Forms W-9. Prior to a Securityholder's receipt of payment of
the amounts to which such holder has a right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Article 2, each such holder shall have delivered to the Exchange
Agent a properly completed and duly executed IRS Form W-9 or IRS Form W-8BEN (or
suitable substitute form) establishing an exemption from backup withholding.

      6.9   Indemnification. For a period of six years from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to (i)
indemnify and hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the
Company and each present and former director and officer of each Company
Subsidiary (the "D&O Indemnified Parties"), against any losses incurred or
suffered by any of the D&O Indemnified Parties in connection with any
liabilities or any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent that the Company, the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws, other
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, or any agreement providing
for such indemnification, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof,
indemnify such D&O Indemnified Party and (ii) advance expenses as incurred by
any D&O Indemnified Party in connection with any matters for which such D&O
Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from Parent and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 6.9 to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and under the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws, other
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, or any agreement providing
for such indemnification, in each case, as in effect on the date hereof;
provided, however, that the D&O Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced
shall first provide an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such D&O Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
under applicable Law, the Company Articles, any Company Bylaws, other
organizational documents of the Company Subsidiary, any agreement providing for
such indemnification, or pursuant to this Section 6.9. Any amount paid to
indemnify directors and officers of the Company for any liability relating to
the approval of this Agreement or the Merger shall in no event constitute
Damages for purposes of Article 8.

      6.10  No Drag Along. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not
exercise its rights pursuant to Section 6 of that certain Co-Sale, First Refusal
and Transaction Voting Agreement dated as of August 20, 2002 by and among the
Company and the investors


                                       54

and shareholders listed therein, other than in connection with the approval of
the Merger and matters in furtherance thereof.

            (a)   Each party shall be entitled to rely upon the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement and other documents delivered in

party's investigation, lack of investigation, knowledge, lack of knowledge
(except as expressly provided in Section 3.22) or otherwise and, except as set

and not jointly, indemnify, save and hold harmless Parent, Merger Sub and their

      inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, made by the Company in this
      Agreement or any exhibit, schedule, certificate (including the Company
      Disclosure Letter) or agreement delivered by the Company pursuant hereto;

                  (ii)  any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be

      willful misconduct or gross negligence by any such officer, director or
      employee (at or above the director level) of the Company or Company
      Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, any
      amount paid to indemnify directors and officers of the Company for any
      liability relating to the approval of this Agreement or the Merger shall
      in no event constitute Damages for purposes of this Article 8;

                  (iv)  Excess Payments (including any Damages suffered through
      and after the applicable survival period);

                  (v)   Excess Expenses, to the extent the same did not result
      in a reduction of the Total Merger Consideration; and

                  (vi)  a failure to comply with Pharmaceutical Laws in the
      testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, storage, packaging, sale or
      distribution of Surodex or Suroquin.

            (b)   By Parent and Surviving Corporation. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation (in such capacity, each a "Parent Indemnifying Party" and
collectively, the "Parent Indemnifying Parties") shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify, save and hold harmless the Securityholders and each of their
successors and permitted assigns, (each, a "Company Indemnified Party" and
collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
Damages, to the extent incurred in connection with, arising out of, resulting
from or incident to:

                  (i)   any breach of any representation or warranty or the
      inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, made by Parent or Merger Sub
      in


                                       60
<PAGE>
      this Agreement or any exhibit, schedule, certificate or agreement
      delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant hereto; and

                  (ii)  any breach of any covenant or agreement made, or to be
      performed, by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or any exhibit,
      schedule, certificate or agreement delivered by Parent or Merger Sub
      pursuant hereto.

            (c)   Limitations.

                  (i)   Threshold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
      contained herein, in seeking indemnification for Damages under this
      Article 8, no Indemnified Party will make a claim for Damages unless and
      until such Damages aggregate at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
      ($500,000) (the "Threshold"), in which event such Indemnified Party shall
      be entitled to recover the full amount of such Damages, including Damages
      comprising the Threshold; provided, however, that such Threshold will not
      apply to any claim for indemnification made by any Indemnified Party that
      results from: (A) fraud or willful breach hereof, (B) the Company's breach
      of the representations or warranties set forth in Section 3.4, 3.5, 3.11
      and 3.18, (C) Excess Payments and (D) Excess Expenses, to the extent the
      same did not result in a reduction of the Total Merger Consideration.

                  (ii)  Cap. No payment by Indemnifying Parties shall be payable
      to Indemnified Parties to the extent the aggregated claims for Damages of
      such Indemnified Parties exceeds (A) in the case of claims against the
      Parent Indemnifying Parties, an amount equal to Thirty Million Dollars
      ($30,000,000) and (B) in the case of claims against the Company
      Indemnifying Parties, the funds held in the Indemnification Escrow Fund
      pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. The limitations of the
      indemnity obligations of the Indemnifying Parties set forth in this
      Section 8.2(c)(ii) shall not apply to any claim for indemnification made
      by any Indemnified Party that results from: (X) fraud or willful breach
      hereof or (Y) the Company's breach of the representations or warranties
      set forth in Section 3.4 or Section 3.5.

                  (iii) Other Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt and
      notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement:

                        (A)   Subject to Section 8.2(c)(iii)(C), (1) the Parent
            Indemnified Parties shall have no recourse against any Company
            Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Agreement or any exhibit,
            schedule, certificate (including the Company Disclosure Letter) or
            agreement delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, for
            any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in
            this Agreement or in any exhibit, schedule, certificate (including
            the Company Disclosure Letter) or agreement delivered by the Company
            pursuant to this Agreement, or for any other obligation to indemnify
            pursuant to Section 8.2(a), other than the amounts in the
            Indemnnification Escrow Fund,


                                       61
<PAGE>
            except with respect to a breach of the representations or warranties
            set forth in Section 3.4 or Section 3.5, (2) in no event shall any
            Company Indemnifying Party be liable to the Parent Indemnified
            Parties for an aggregate amount in excess of such Company
            Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the Total Merger
            Consideration, and (3) in no event shall any Company Indemnifying
            Party be liable to the Parent Indemnified Parties with respect to
            any claim for Damages for an amount in excess of such Company
            Indemnifying Party's Pro Rata Portion of the amount that the Parent
            Indemnified Parties are entitled to receive with respect to such
            claim.

                        (B)   Subject to Section 8.2(c)(iii)(C), this Section
            8.2 shall be the sole remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties and
            the Company Indemnified Parties after the Effective Time for any
            breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this
            Agreement or in any exhibit, schedule, certificate (including the
            Company Disclosure Letter) or agreement delivered by the Company,
            Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement.

                        (C)   Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
            the contrary, no Person shall be deemed to have waived any rights,
            claims, causes of action or remedies arising from fraud, intentional
            misrepresentation, active concealment or willful breach hereof
            against a Person committing such fraud, intentional
            misrepresentation or active concealment or willfully taking actions
            to cause a breach hereof; provided that no Company Indemnifying
            Party shall have any liability in excess of its Pro Rata Portion of
            the Total Merger Consideration with respect to the fraud,
            intentional misrepresentation or active concealment or willful
            taking of actions to cause a breach hereof of any other Person;
            provided, further, that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the
            liability of a Company Indemnifying Party for such Company
            Indemnifying Party's fraud, intentional misrepresentation or active
            concealment or willful taking of actions to cause a breach hereof.

                        (D)   The amount of any Damages for which
            indemnification is provided under this Article 8 shall be calculated
            net of (A) any accrual, reserves or provisions reflected in the
            Interim Balance Sheet that related to the nature of the claim from
            which such Damages arose and (B) insurance benefits.

            (d)   Damage Payments. Each of the Company Indemnifying Parties and
the Securityholders' Representative hereby agrees that if, following the
Closing, any payment is made pursuant to this Article 8 by such Company
Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages (a "Damage Payment"), such Company
Indemnifying Party shall have no rights against the Surviving Corporation, or
any current or former director, officer or employee thereof (in their capacity
as such), whether by reason of contribution, indemnification, subrogation or
otherwise, in respect of any such Damage Payment, and shall not take any action
against the


                                       62
<PAGE>
Surviving Corporation or any such Person with respect thereto. Any rights with
respect to Damage Payments which any of the Company Indemnifying Parties or the
Securityholders' Representative may, by operation or law or otherwise, have
against the Surviving Corporation or any such Person shall, effective at the
time of the Closing, be deemed to be hereby expressly and knowingly waived.

            (e)   Interpretation.

                  (i)   The term "Damages" as used in this Section 8.2 is not
      limited to matters asserted by third parties against an Indemnified Party,
      but includes Damages incurred or sustained by the Indemnified Party in the
      absence of third party claims.

                  (ii)  For purposes of this Section 8.2, once it has been
      determined that a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
      Parent, Merger Sub or the Company contained in this Agreement or any
      exhibit, schedule, certificate (including the Company Disclosure Letter)
      or agreement delivered by such party pursuant hereto has been breached and
      such breach gives rise to a claim for Damages, such representation,
      warranty, covenant or agreement shall be deemed not to be qualified by any
      threshold amount, limitation as to materiality or to whether or not any
      such breach results or may result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
      Parent Material Adverse Effect for purposes of determining the Damages
      incurred or suffered arising out of any such breach and no deduction from
      such Damages shall be taken on account of any threshold amount,
      materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse
      Effect qualification contained in any representation, warranty, covenant
      or agreement giving rise to the claim for indemnification hereunder.

      8.3   Procedure for Claims between Parties. Except as provided in Section
6.8(d) with respect to Tax Contests:

            (a)   If a claim for Damages is to be made by a Parent Indemnified
Party entitled to indemnification hereunder, Parent shall be the only party
entitled to give Notice to the Securityholders' Representative and shall give
such Notice to the Securityholders' Representative and, during the
Indemnification Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent as soon as reasonably
practicable after Parent becomes aware that a fact, condition or event has
occurred or exists which may give rise to Damages for which indemnification by a
Parent Indemnified Party may be sought under this Article 8 (a "Notice"). If a
claim for Damages is to be made by a Company Indemnified Party entitled to
indemnification hereunder, the Securityholders' Representative shall be the only
party entitled to give Notice to Parent, and shall give such Notice to Parent as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Securityholders' Representative becomes
aware that a fact, condition or event has occurred or exists which may give rise
to Damages for which indemnification by a Company Indemnified Party may be
sought under this Article 8. In each case, the Notice shall (i) describe in
reasonable detail the facts and circumstances known to the Indemnified Party
that gave rise to such indemnification claim, and the amount or, if the amount
cannot then be reasonably determined, good faith estimate of the amount arising
therefrom and (ii) provide for a demand of payment of the amount or, if the

                                       63
<PAGE>
amount cannot then be reasonably determined, a good faith estimate of the amount
arising from such claim for Damages. Any delay in submitting a Notice to the
Securityholders' Representative or Parent, as applicable, shall not relieve any
Indemnifying Party of any liability hereunder, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party was prejudiced by such delay; provided that Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall only be entitled to submit a Notice with
respect to a breach, or alleged breach, of a representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement or any exhibit, schedule, certificate (including the
Company Disclosure Letter) or agreement delivered by the Company or by Parent or
Merger Sub, respectively, pursuant hereto on or before the expiration of the
applicable survival period with respect to such representation and warranty
provided in Section 8.1(b).

            (b)   If the Securityholders' Representative does not object in
writing within the twenty (20) calendar day period after delivery by Parent of
the Notice, such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgment by
the Securityholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Indemnifying
Parties that the Parent Indemnified Parties identified in the Notice are
entitled to the full amount of the claim for Damages set forth in such Notice.
If Parent does not object in writing within the twenty (20) calendar day period
after delivery by the Securityholders' Representative of the Notice, such
failure to so object shall be an irrevocable acknowledgement by Parent that the
Company Indemnified Parties identified in the Notice are entitled to the full
amount of the claim for Damages set forth in such Notice.

            (c)   For a period of twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of a
Notice from Parent, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to the Parent
Indemnified Parties identified in the Notice of any Indemnification Escrow
Amount (other than the amount of any Damages agreed to by the Securityholders'
Representative as provided below) unless the Escrow Agent shall have received
written authorization from the Securityholders' Representative to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such twenty (20) calendar day period, the
Escrow Agent shall make delivery of cash from the Indemnification Escrow Fund
equal to the amount of Damages claimed in the Notice; provided that no such
payment may be made if the Securityholders' Representative shall object in a
written statement to the claim made in the Notice (an "Objection Notice"), and
such Objection Notice shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
expiration of such twenty (20) calendar day period. The Securityholders'
Representative shall, however, authorize the Escrow Agent to deliver cash from
the Indemnification Escrow Fund equal to the amount of Damages claimed in any
Notice to the extent the Securityholders' Representative does not dispute the
amount of such Damages. After receipt of a Notice from the Securityholders'
Representative, Parent shall deliver cash equal to the amount of Damages claimed
in any Notice to the extent Parent does not dispute the amount of such Damages.
After the expiration of twenty (20) calendar days after receipt of a Notice from
the Securityholders' Representative, Parent shall make delivery of cash equal to
the amount of Damages claimed in the Notice; provided that no such payment shall
be made if Parent shall object in a written statement to the claim made in the
Notice (a "Parent Objection Notice"), and such Parent Objection Notice shall
have been delivered to the Securityholders' Representative prior to the
expiration of such twenty (20) calendar day period.

            (d)   If Parent shall deliver a Notice within the applicable time
period set forth in Section 8.1(b) in respect of a claim arising out of or
resulting from fraud, willful breach hereof or the Company's breach of the
representations or warranties set forth in Section


                                       64
<PAGE>
3.4 or Section 3.5 and the amount remaining in the Indemnification Escrow Fund
is insufficient to reimburse the Parent Indemnified Parties for Damages arising
out of or resulting therefrom, the Company Indemnifying Parties shall promptly
pay, subject to Section 8.2(c)(ii), Section 8.2(c)(iii), Section 8.3(c) and
Section 8.5, any amount set forth in such Notice.

      8.4   Defense of Third Party Claims.

      Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.8(d) with respect to Tax
Contests:

            (a)   If any lawsuit or enforcement action is filed against an
Indemnified Party by any third party (each a "Third Party Claim") for which
indemnification under this Article 8 may be sought, written notice ("Third Party
Notice") thereof shall be given by the Securityholders' Representative to Parent
or by Parent to the Securityholders' Representative, as applicable, as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) calendar days of service.
The Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances known
to the Indemnified Party that gave rise to such indemnification claim, and the
amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom. The delay of any
Indemnified Party in giving a Third Party Notice hereunder shall not affect
rights to indemnification hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party was prejudiced by such delay.

            (b)   After receipt of such Third Party Notice, if the recipient of
the Third Party Notice acknowledges in writing to the sender that the applicable
Indemnifying Parties are liable, and have indemnity obligations for any Damages
resulting from any such Third Party Claim (subject to the limitations set forth
in this Article 8), then the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so
elects at its own cost, risk and expense, (i) to take control of the defense and
investigation of such Third Party Claim, (ii) to employ and engage attorneys of
its own choice (provided, that such attorneys are reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party) to diligently handle and defend the same, unless the named
parties to such action or proceeding include both one or more Indemnifying
Parties and an Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party has been advised in
writing by counsel that there are one or more legal defenses available to such
Indemnified Party that are different from or additional to those available to an
applicable Indemnifying Party or there is otherwise a conflict of interest that
exists or is reasonably likely to exist that would make it inappropriate, in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, for the same counsel to represent
both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Parties, in which event such
Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at the Indemnifying Parties' cost and
expense, to separate counsel of its own choosing (provided, that such cost and
expense shall be limited to one firm of attorneys, together with appropriate
local counsel, for any such Third Party Claim) and (iii) to compromise or settle
such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, unless the Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates are released in full in connection with the settlement, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnified
Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, after conferring with
outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money damages.
If such equitable relief or relief for other than money damages portion of the
Third Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume


                                       65
<PAGE>
the defense of the portion relating to money damages. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Indemnifying Party and its
attorneys in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third Party Claim and
any appeal arising therefrom; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may,
at its own cost, participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such
lawsuit or action and any appeal arising therefrom and may, at its own expense,
retain separate counsel of its choosing. The parties shall cooperate with each
other in any notifications to insurers.

            (c)   If the Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the Third Party Notice
that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Section 8.4, or if the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 8.4 but fails to diligently prosecute or settle
the Third Party Claim, which failure continues for ten (10) calendar days after
notice to the Indemnifying Party from the Indemnified Party of such failure,
then the Indemnified Party against which such claim has been asserted will have
the right to undertake, and the cost and expense thereof will constitute
Damages, the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party Claim on
behalf of and (subject to Section 8.2(c), Section 8.3(c) and Section 8.5) for
the account and risk of the Indemnifying Parties. The Indemnified Party shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings; provided, however, that such
claim shall not be compromised or settled without the prior written consent of
the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in all reasonable respects with the
Indemnified Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnified Party at
the Indemnifying Party's expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and
information in the Indemnifying Party's possession or under the Indemnifying
Party's control relating thereto as are reasonably required by the Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnified Party will keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably
informed of the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement.

            (d)   Subject to Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.5, in the event the
Securityholders' Representative has consented to any settlement pursuant to
Section 8.4(c), the Securityholders' Representative shall promptly deliver a
notice to the Escrow Agent specifying the monetary amount of such settlement and
instructing the Escrow Agent to pay such amount out of the Indemnification
Escrow Fund to the applicable Parent Indemnified Party.

      8.5   Resolution of Conflicts and Claims.

            (a)   If an Indemnifying Party objects in writing to any claim (or
part of any claim) for indemnification made by an Indemnified Party in any
Objection Notice, the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party shall attempt in
good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims. If the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party should so
agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by
both parties and, in the event such agreement involves a payment to a Parent
Indemnified Party, shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum and distribute funds from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.


                                       66
<PAGE>
            (b)   If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation and prior to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Objection Notice,
either Parent or the Securityholders' Representative may demand arbitration of
the matter unless the amount of the Damage that is at issue is the subject of a
pending litigation involving a Third Party Claim, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by arbitration
conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative. In the event that, within fifteen (15) days
after submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within fifteen
(15) days after the end of such fifteen (15) day period, Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative shall each select one arbitrator. The two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator. If the Securityholders'
Representative fails to select an arbitrator during this fifteen (15) day
period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be conducted by one
arbitrator selected by Parent. If Parent fails to select an arbitrator during
this fifteen (15) day period, then the parties agree that the arbitration will
be conducted by one arbitrator selected by the Securityholders' Representative.

            (c)   Any such arbitration shall be held in Los Angeles, California,
under the rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. If the
American Arbitration Association or its successor ceases to provide arbitration
services, then the term "American Arbitration Association" as used in this
Agreement will thereafter mean and refer to J.A.M.S./ENDISPUTE. The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration shall
be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of each
arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration Association.
The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time
period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for
discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole
judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may
be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators,
as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and
shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys' fees and
costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the
arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or that
discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification. The
decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case
may be, as to the validity and amount of any claim shall be final, binding, and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Such conclusions shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the
Indemnification Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award,
judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within thirty (30) days of a decision
of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party shall
make the payment to such other party or, in the case of a payment to a Parent
Indemnified Party, cause the Escrow Agent to make the payment to such
Indemnified Party.

            (d)   Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. The foregoing arbitration provision
shall apply to any dispute between Indemnifying Parties and Indemnified Parties
under this Article 8 hereof,


                                       67
<PAGE>
whether relating to claims upon the Indemnification Escrow Fund or to the other
indemnification obligations set forth in this Article 8.

      8.6   Securityholders' Representative.

            (a)   Carl Goldfischer shall be the Company Indemnifying Parties'
and the Company Indemnified Parties' representative (the "Securityholders'
Representative") and, as such, shall serve as and have all powers as agent and
attorney-in-fact of each Company Indemnifying Party or Company Indemnified
Party, as the case may be, for and on behalf of each Company Indemnifying Party
or Company Indemnified Party, as the case may be: (i) to give and receive
notices and communications with respect to any matters related to this Agreement
for which the Securityholders' Representative is authorized to act; (ii) to
authorize delivery of cash from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to a Parent
Indemnified Party; (iii) to negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand mediation and arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Article 8; (iv) to litigate, mediate, arbitrate, defend, enforce or take
any other actions and execute the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and any other
documents that the Securityholders' Representative deems advisable in connection
with enforcing any rights or obligations or defending any claim or action under
this Agreement on behalf of the Company Indemnifying Parties and the Company
Indemnified Parties; (v) to sign receipts, consents or other documents in
connection with the Securityholders' Representative's duties hereunder; and (vi)
to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Securityholders' Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. If Carl
Goldfischer ceases to act as the Securityholders' Representative for any reason,
Steven A. Elms shall be appointed as the Securityholders' Representative. If
Steven A. Elms ceases to act as the Securityholders' Representative for any
reason, such Securityholders' Representative or his agent shall notify Parent of
such Securityholders' Representative's intent to resign as Securityholders'
Representative, and the Securityholders entitled to receive a majority of the
Total Merger Consideration (determined as of the date hereof) (a "Majority")
shall, by written notice to Parent, appoint a successor Securityholders'
Representative within thirty (30) calendar days. Notice or communications to or
from the Securityholders' Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Company Indemnifying Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties. All actions to
be taken by a Company Indemnified Party or Company Indemnifying Party, as the
case may be, shall be taken solely by the Securityholders' Representative.

            (b)   Subject to Section 8.6(a), in the event of (i) the death or
permanent disability of the Securityholders' Representative, (ii) the
Securityholders' Representative's resignation as a Securityholders'
Representative, or (iii) the removal of the Securityholders' Representative by a
Majority, a successor Securityholders' Representative shall be elected by a
Majority. Each successor Securityholders' Representative shall have all of the
power, authority, rights and privileges conferred by this Agreement upon the
original Securityholders' Representative, and the term "Securityholders'
Representative" as used herein shall be deemed to include any successor
Securityholders' Representative.

            (c)   In the event information with respect to a Company
Indemnifying Party set forth in Exhibit B to the Indemnification Escrow
Agreement becomes outdated or inaccurate, such Company Indemnifying Party shall
promptly notify the Securityholders'


                                       68
<PAGE>
Representative of such inaccuracy and provide the appropriate updated and
accurate information to the Securityholders' Representative.

            (d)   The Securityholders' Representative may, in all questions
arising under this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel, and shall not be
liable to any Company Indemnifying Party or Company Indemnified Party for any
action taken or not taken as a Securityholders' Representative in the absence of
such Securityholders' Representative's willful misconduct or bad faith.

            (e)   A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholders' Representative shall constitute a decision of the Company
Indemnifying Parties or the Company Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon the Company Indemnifying Parties or
the Company Indemnified Parties, as the case may be. The Escrow Agent and any
Parent Indemnified Party may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Securityholders' Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Company Indemnifying Parties or the Company Indemnified
Parties, as the case may be. Although the Securityholders' Representative shall
not be obligated to obtain instructions from the Company Indemnifying Parties or
the Company Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, prior to any decision, act,
consent or instruction, if, and to the extent that, the Securityholders'
Representative receives any written instructions from a Majority, the
Securityholders' Representative shall comply with such instructions.

            (f)   The Company Indemnifying Parties shall severally in proportion
to their Pro Rata Portion (and not jointly), indemnify and defend the
Securityholders' Representative and hold the Securityholders' Representative
harmless against any loss, damage, cost, liability or expense incurred without
willful misconduct or bad faith by the Securityholders' Representative and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance, performance or
administration of the Securityholders' Representative's duties under this
Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement or the Expenses Escrow
Agreement, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel,
accountants, auditors and other advisors retained by the Securityholders'
Representative in performing his or her obligations under this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Expenses Escrow Agreement and
obligations incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in the satisfaction
of his duties under this Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and
Expenses Escrow Agreement. Any out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in
connection with the acceptance, performance and administration of his or her
duties as Securityholders' Representative pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Expenses Escrow Agreement (including
the hiring of legal counsel, accountants or auditors and other advisors pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement and any amounts paid by the Securityholders'
Representative to indemnify the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Indemnification
Escrow Agreement or the Expenses Escrow Agreement), except those costs and
expenses which Parent is obligated to pay pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, the Indemnification Escrow Agreement and the Expenses Escrow
Agreement ("Securityholders' Representative's Costs"), shall be paid by the
Company Indemnifying Parties in accordance with each Company Indemnifying
Party's Pro Rata Portion of such Securityholders' Representative's Costs as
follows: (i) first by recourse to the Expenses Escrow Amount then held in the
Expenses Escrow Fund and (ii) if such Expenses Escrow


                                       69
<PAGE>
Amount is insufficient to pay for such Securityholders' Representative's Costs,
then by recourse directly to each Company Indemnifying Party. Parent and the
Company each acknowledge and agree that the Expenses Escrow Amount shall be used
to pay such Securityholders' Representative's Costs. Each of the Company
Indemnifying Parties, by voting in favor of the Merger, acknowledges and agrees
that such Company Indemnifying Party has authorized and approved the use of the
Expenses Escrow Amount to pay Securityholders' Representative's Costs and, to
the extent that the Expenses Escrow Amount is insufficient to pay for such
Securityholders' Representative's Costs, to pay such costs directly or reimburse
the Securityholders' Representative for such costs.

            (g)   The power of attorney granted by the Company Indemnifying
Parties and the Company Indemnified Parties to the Securityholders'
Representative pursuant to this Section 8.6 is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable and shall not terminate or otherwise be affected by the death,
disability, incompetence, bankruptcy or insolvency of any Company Indemnifying
Party or Company Indemnified Party.

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

      9.1   Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger
contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the terminating party
or parties, whether before or after the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained:

            (a)   by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company, by action
of their respective Boards of Directors;

            (b)   by written notice of either the Company or Parent to the other
party, if the Merger shall not have been consummated prior to February 13, 2004;
provided, however, that such date may, from time to time, be extended by Parent
or the Company (by providing written notice thereof to the other party within
five Business Days prior to and including February 13, 2004) up to and including
May 13, 2004, in the event all conditions to effect the Merger other than those
set forth in Section 7.1(b), Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.2(d) (the "Regulatory
Conditions") have been or are capable of being satisfied at the time of such
extension and the Regulatory Conditions have been or are reasonably capable of
being satisfied on or prior to May 13, 2004 (the later of the foregoing dates,
as they may be so extended, shall be referred to herein as the "Outside Date");
provided further, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
9.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date;

            (c)   by written notice of either the Company or Parent, if any
Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or
other action shall have become final and nonappealable (which order, decree,
ruling or other action the parties shall have used their commercially reasonable
efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable), provided, however, that


                                       70
<PAGE>
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, such order, decree,
ruling or the taking of such other action;

            (d)   by written notice of Parent, (i) if since the date of this
Agreement, there shall have been any event, development or change of
circumstance that constitutes, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect and such event, development or change of circumstances
is not cured in all material respects, within 60 days after written notice
thereof, (ii) if (A) the Company has breached any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement and (B) such breach is not
cured, or cannot be cured, in all material respects, within 20 days after
written notice thereof or (iii) if the Board of Directors of the Company shall
have withdrawn or adversely modified its recommendation to adopt this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby to the Shareholders or Noteholders or
publicly indicated its intention to do so; or

            (e)   by written notice of the Company, if (i) Parent or Merger Sub
has breached any covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement and (ii) such breach is not cured, or cannot be cured,
in all material respects, within 20 days after written notice thereof.

      9.2   Effect of Termination.

      In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1
hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company;
provided, however, that each party hereto shall remain liable for any breaches
of this Agreement or any certificate, agreement or other instruments delivered
pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination; and provided further, that,
the provisions of Section 6.2(b), Section 6.5, Section 6.7 and Article 10 hereof
and this Section 9.2 shall remain in full force and effect and survive any
termination of this Agreement pursuant to the terms of this Article 9 or
otherwise.

<PAGE>

to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties shall
be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other
remedies at Law or in equity.

      10.13 Disclosure. Nothing in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein
unless the Company Disclosure Letter identifies the exception with particularity
and describes the relevant facts in reasonable detail. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it is expressly understood and acknowledged that any information
disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter under any numbered or lettered part
shall be deemed to relate to and qualify representations and warranties set
forth in one or more other parts of the Company Disclosure Letter, but only
where the relevance of such disclosure to such other part or parts is clear from
the text of such disclosure provided, however, the mere listing (or inclusion of
a copy) of a document or other item shall not by itself be deemed adequate to
disclose an exception to a representation or warranty made herein (unless the
representation or warranty has to do with the existence of the document or item
itself). No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in the
Company Disclosure Letter shall be construed as an admission or indication that
such item or other matter is material or that such item or other matter is
required to be referred to or disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter. No
reference in the Company Disclosure Letter to any agreement or document shall be
construed as an admission or indication that such agreement or document is
enforceable or currently in effect or that there are any obligations remaining
to be performed or any rights that may be exercised under such agreement or
document in the absence of a separate representation or warranty to that effect.
No disclosure in the Company Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach
or violation of any agreement, law or regulation shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually
occurred.

      10.14 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval or the adoption of this Agreement by the sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, no amendment may be made without further shareholder
approval which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant stock
exchange, requires further approval by such shareholders. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto.

      10.15 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (A) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party hereto, (B) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (C) waive compliance by the other party
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; provided, however,
that after the Company Shareholder Approval, there may not be, without further
approval of such Shareholders, any extension or waiver of this Agreement or any
portion thereof which by Law requires further approval by such Shareholders. Any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each
of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
