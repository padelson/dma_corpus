(a) Unless otherwise agreed to by the Sellers Representative and the Buyer, on
the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers Representative
shall prepare (in consultation and cooperation with the Buyer) and deliver to
the Buyer a certificate executed by the chief financial officer of the Company
setting forth the good faith estimate of (i) Cash as of the Effective Time
(such estimate, the " **Estimated Cash** "), (ii) the Company Debt as of the
Effective Time (such estimate, the " **Estimated Company Debt** "), (iii) the
unpaid portion of the Selling Expenses (the " **Estimated**

 



      
 

 



 

 **Selling Expenses** ") and (iv) the Net Working Capital as of the Effective
Time prepared in accordance with the principles set forth on _Schedule
2.3(a)_ (such estimate, the " **Estimated Working Capital** "), which estimate
shall, upon the Buyers written request, be supported by working papers and
other reasonable supporting documents setting forth such estimate; _provided_
, _however_ , in the event there is disagreement between the Sellers
Representative and the Buyer with respect to any of such estimates that cannot
be resolved between the parties prior to the Closing (it being understood that
in no event shall the Closing be delayed as a result of any such
disagreement), the Sellers Representatives estimate shall be used for
purposes of determining the calculation of the Purchase Price payable at the
Closing. If the Estimated Working Capital is less than the Target Working
Capital, the Initial Purchase Price will be reduced by the amount of such
shortfall (the " **Working Capital Underage** "), subject to further
adjustment as provided in this _Section 2.3_. If the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than the Target Working Capital, the Initial Purchase Price
will be increased by the amount of such excess (the " **Working Capital
Overage** "), subject to further adjustment as provided in this _Section
2.3_.

 



 

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Sellers Representative a statement (the "
**Closing Statement** "), setting forth the Buyers calculation of: (i) the
Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time, prepared in accordance with the
principles of preparation set forth on _Schedule 2.3(a)_ (the " **Closing
Working Capital** "), (ii) the Company Debt as of the Effective Time (the "
**Closing Company Debt** "), (iii) the unpaid portion of Selling Expenses as
of the Effective Time (the " **Closing Selling Expenses** "), and (iv) Cash as
of the Effective Time, prepared in accordance with the methodology used to
prepare the Estimated Cash (the " **Closing Cash** "), which calculation shall
be accompanied by working papers and other reasonable supporting documents
setting forth such calculation.

 



 

(c) Within 30 days following receipt by the Sellers Representative of the
Closing Statement, the Sellers Representative shall deliver written notice to
the Buyer of any dispute it has with respect to the preparation or content of
the Closing Statement. If the Sellers Representative does not notify the Buyer
in writing of a dispute with respect to the Closing Statement within such
30-day period (which notification shall state in reasonable detail the basis
of the Sellers Representatives objection), such Closing Statement will be
final, conclusive and binding on the parties. To the extent not set forth in
such a notification of dispute, the Sellers Representative shall be deemed to
have agreed with Buyers calculation of all other items and amounts contained
in the Closing Statement. In the event of such notification of a dispute, the
Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve
such dispute. If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative, notwithstanding
such good faith effort, fail to resolve such dispute within 30 days after the
Sellers Representative advises the Buyer of its objections, then the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall jointly enter into an engagement letter with
the Arbitration Firm to resolve such dispute. Such engagement letter shall
provide that the Arbitration Firm shall consider only those items and amounts
in dispute. As promptly as practicable thereafter, the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative shall each prepare and submit a presentation to the Arbitration
Firm and shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Arbitration Firm such
work papers and other documents and information relating to

 



       
 

 



 

the items and amounts in dispute as the Arbitration Firm may reasonably
request and as are available to that party or its advisors and agents. As soon
as practicable thereafter, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative will cause
the Arbitration Firm to choose one of the parties positions with respect to
each of Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Debt, Closing Selling
Expenses and Closing Cash, as applicable, based solely upon the presentations
by the Buyer and the Sellers Representative. The party whose position is not

(d) Within two Business Days after the date on which the Closing Working
Capital, Closing Company Debt, Closing Selling Expenses and Closing Cash are
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, if the amount of the
Purchase Price as would have been determined pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ had
(i) the Closing Working Capital (as finally determined pursuant to _Section
2.3(c)_) been substituted for the Estimated Working Capital for purposes of
_Section 2.3(a)_, and (ii) Closing Company Debt, Closing Selling Expenses and
Closing Cash (each as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_) been
substituted for the Estimated Company Debt, Estimated Selling Expenses and
Estimated Cash, respectively, as of the Closing, is different from the
Purchase Price that was paid on the Closing Date, then:

 



 

(i) If such substitutions would have resulted in a Purchase Price that is less
than the Purchase Price that was paid on the Closing Date, then the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent (an " **Adjustment Notice** ") instructing the Escrow Agent to
release an amount of cash equal to such shortfall from the Adjustment Escrow
Amount to the Buyer, by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by the Buyer to the Sellers Representative

shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the remainder of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount to the Sellers Representative for further distribution to the
Stockholders and to the Company for further distribution to the Optionholders,
in each case, in their respective Seller Pro Rata Portions. With respect to
the Optionholders, such amounts shall be paid by the Escrow Agent to the

Amount. In no

Escrow Amount then available for distribution under the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

(ii) If such substitutions would have resulted in a Purchase Price that is
greater than the Purchase Price that was paid on the Closing Date, then Buyer
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers Representative for further
distribution to the Stockholders and to the Company for further distribution
to the Optionholders, in each case, in accordance with their respective
proportions set forth on _Schedule 2.3(d)_ (the " **Seller Pro Rata
Portions** "), an amount in cash equal to such excess. With respect to the
Stockholders, such amounts shall be paid by the Buyer within five Business
Days from the date on which the Closing Working Capital, Closing Company Debt,
Closing Selling Expenses and Closing Cash are finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.3(c)_ by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to the

turn, pay or cause the Subsidiary to pay such amounts to the Optionholders as
promptly thereafter as practicable by the methods and within the time periods

Company receives such amounts from the Buyer pursuant this _Section 2.3(d)_

Capital, Closing Company Debt, Closing Selling Expenses and Closing Cash are
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, the Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall deliver an Adjustment Notice to the Escrow Agent to
release the Adjustment Escrow Amount to the Sellers Representative for further

paid by the Escrow Agent to the Company and the Company shall, in turn, pay or
cause the Subsidiary to pay such amounts to the Optionholders as promptly
thereafter as practicable by the methods and within the time periods set forth
in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_ (provided that the date on which the Company receives
such amounts from the Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.3(d)_ shall be
substituted for the Closing Date, as appropriate and four (4) Business Days
shall be substituted for the references to two (2) Business Days therein).

 



 

(e) Within two Business Days after the date on which the Closing Working
Capital, Closing Company Debt, Closing Selling Expenses and Closing Cash are
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, if the amount of the
Purchase Price as would have been determined pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ had

for further distribution to the Optionholders, in each case, accordance with
their respective Seller Pro Rata Portions. With respect to the Optionholders,
such amounts shall be paid by Escrow Agent to the Company and the Company
shall, in turn, pay or cause the Subsidiary to pay such amounts to the
Optionholders as promptly thereafter as practicable by the methods and within

litigation or extraordinary collection efforts therefor, except, in the case
of notes and accounts receivable shown on the Companys balance sheet, to the
extent of the reserves set forth on the Companys balance sheet (which
reserves are adequate and calculated consistent with past practices in the
preparation of the Financial Statements), and, in the case of accounts
receivable arising since the Balance Sheet Date, to a reasonable allowance for

(10%) higher than that reflected by the reserve for bad debts on the Companys
balance sheet.

additional plan, agreement or arrangement, or to modify or change in any
material way any existing Employee Plan.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.21(c)_ , each Employee Plan has been
established, maintained, operated, and administered in material compliance
with its terms and any related documents or agreements and in material
compliance with all applicable Laws, and contributions (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions), premiums or
payments required to be made under the terms of any Employee Plan as of the
date of this Agreement have been timely made or, if not yet due, have been
properly reflected on the Interim Financial Statements. There have been no
prohibited transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on
"fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with
respect to the Employee

 



      
 

 



 

Plans that could result in any material liability or excise tax under ERISA or
the Code being imposed on the Company or the Subsidiary.

 



 

(d) Each Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, and each trust created
thereunder has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from tax under the
provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code and, to the Companys Knowledge, no
event or omission has occurred which could reasonably be expected to cause any
such Employee Plan to lose its qualification under the applicable Code
section.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.21(e)_ , none of the Company, the
Subsidiary or any member of the Controlled Group currently has an obligation

Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, a plan maintained by more
than one employer as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code, a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA)
or a "multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section
414(f) of the Code. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.21(e)_ , neither the
Company nor the Subsidiary have ever maintained or contributed to any Employee
Plan providing or promising any health or other nonpension benefits to
employees after their employment terminates other than as required by, or
pursuant to, part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA. No liability under
Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by the Company, the Subsidiary or any
member of the Controlled Group that has not been satisfied in full, and, to
the Companys Knowledge, no condition exists that could give rise to any such
liability thereunder. The Company and the Subsidiary are, and during all
applicable years (not to exceed three years preceding the Closing) have been,
in material compliance with the applicable requirements of the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and all rules and official
guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, the " ** _ACA_** "). No event
has occurred which reasonably could be expected to result in a material
violation of, or penalty or liability under, the ACA.

 



 

(f) There is no pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened,
assessment, complaint, proceeding, arbitration, litigation, or investigation
of any kind in any court or government agency with respect to any Employee
Plan (other than routine claims for benefits).

 



 

(g) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.21(g)_ , no amount that could be
received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee,
officer or director of the Company or any of its Affiliates who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination agreement,
other compensation arrangement or Employee Plan currently in effect would be
characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 



 

(h) Except for payments of the Option Consideration as contemplated in this
Agreement or as set forth on _Schedule 5.21(h)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event such as
termination of employment) (i) result in any payment becoming due to any
employee or other service provider of the Company or any of its Affiliates
under any Employee Plan; (ii) increase any benefits to any employee or other
service provider of the Company or any of its Affiliates otherwise payable
under any Employee Plan; (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of
payment, funding or vesting of any such benefits to any employee or other
service provider of the Company or any of its Affiliates under any Employee
Plan; or (iv) could reasonably be expected to result in an obligation to
accelerate the funding of, or contribution to any, Employee Plan pursuant to
applicable Law, regulation, contractual arrangement or otherwise.

 



 

(i) Any Employee Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and
administered in material compliance with Section 409A of the Code in all
material respects, except to the extent that such noncompliance would not
result in any liability to the Company. No Employee Plan provides a tax gross
up to any service provider with respect to Code Section 4999 or any violation
of Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(j) No Employee Plan is subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside of the
United States or provides compensation or benefits to any employee or former
employee of the Company or the Subsidiary (or any dependent thereof) who
resides outside of the United States.

 **ARTICLE VI 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARENT AND THE BUYER**

 



 

Each of the Parent and the Buyer represents and warrants to the Sellers as
follows:

 



 

6.1 _Investor Representations_ **.** The Shares are being acquired solely for
investment for the Buyers own account, not as a nominee or agent and not with
a view to the resale or distribution of any part thereof, and neither the
Parent nor the Buyer has a present intention of selling, granting a
participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. The Parent and the Buyer
understand that the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act
by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the
Securities Act that depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of
the investment intent and the accuracy of the Parents and the Buyers
representations as expressed herein. The Parent and the Buyer understand that
the Shares are "restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state
securities Laws and that, pursuant to these Laws, the Buyer must hold the
Shares indefinitely unless they are registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from
such registration and qualification requirements is available. The Parent and
the Buyer understand that no public market now exists for the Shares and that
the Company has

 



      
 

 



 

made no assurances that a public market will ever exist for the Shares. The

jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. The Buyer is a Massachusetts
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization. The Parent and the
Buyer are duly qualified to do business, and in good standing, in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by the
Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, or in which the conduct of its business
requires the Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, to be so qualified.

 



 

6.3 _Validity and Enforceability_. The Parent and the Buyer have the requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Parent and the Buyer, as applicable. This Agreement
has been and the Ancillary Agreements will be duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Parent and the Buyer and constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Parent and the Buyer, enforceable against the Parent
and the Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as limited by the General
Enforceability Exceptions.

 



 

6.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements by the Parent and the Buyer nor the consummation by the Parent and
the Buyer, of the transactions contemplated herein or therein nor compliance
by the Parent and the Buyer, as applicable, with any of the provisions hereof,
will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or equivalent organizational documents
of the Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, (ii) constitute or result in the
breach of any material term, condition or provision of, or constitute a
default under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or
acceleration with respect to any Contract to which the Parent or the Buyer, as
applicable, is a party or by which they or any of their respective properties
or assets may be subject, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon, any property or assets of the Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, and
that would, in any such event, have a material adverse effect on the Parent
and the Buyer, as applicable, or (iii) subject to receipt of the requisite
approvals under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, violate any Order or
Law applicable to the Parent or the Buyer or any of their respective
properties or assets.

 



 

(b) Other than as required under the HSR Act or any other Competition Law, no
consent is necessary for the consummation by the Parent or the Buyer of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

6.5 _Proceedings_. There is no Proceeding pending that relates to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or, to the knowledge of the
Parent and the Buyer, threatened, against or affecting the Parent and the
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates that challenges the validity or
enforceability of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or seeks to
enjoin or prohibit consummation of, or seek other material equitable relief
with respect to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or that would
reasonably be expected to impair or delay the Parents and the Buyers ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

 



 

6.6 _Brokers_. Except for Evercore Group, LLC, no broker, finder or similar
agent has been employed by or on behalf of the Parent or the Buyer, and no
Person with which the Parent or the Buyer has had any dealings or
communications of any kind is entitled to any brokerage commission or finders
fee in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.7 _Independent Investigation; No Reliance_. In connection with its
investment decision, the Buyer and/or its representatives have inspected and
conducted such reasonable independent review, investigation and analysis
(financial and otherwise) of the Company and the Subsidiary as desired by the
Buyer. The purchase of the Shares by the Buyer and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby by the Parent and the Buyer are not done in
reliance upon any representation or warranty or omission by, or information
from, the Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates, employees or representatives, whether oral or written, express or
implied, except for the representations and warranties specifically and
expressly set forth in _Article IV_ and _Article V_ (as modified by the
Schedules), and the Parent and the Buyer acknowledges that the Company and the
Sellers expressly disclaim any other representations and warranties. Such
purchase and consummation are done entirely on the basis of the Parents and
the Buyers own investigation, analysis, judgment and assessment of the
present and potential value and earning power of the Company and the
Subsidiary, as well as those representations and warranties by the Company and
the Sellers, as applicable, specifically and expressly set forth in _Article
IV_ and _Article V_ (as modified by the Schedules). The Parent and the Buyer
acknowledge that neither the Company nor the Sellers have made any
representations or warranties to the Parent or the Buyer regarding the
probable success or profitability of the Company, the Subsidiary or their
respective businesses. The Parent and the Buyer further acknowledge that none
of the Sellers, the Company, the Subsidiary nor any other Person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any information regarding the Company, the Subsidiary, the
Korean JV or their respective businesses or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement not specifically and expressly set forth in this Agreement (as
modified by the Schedules), and none of the Sellers, the Company, the
Subsidiary or any other Person will have or be subject to any liability to the
Parent or the Buyer or any other Person resulting from the distribution to the
Parent or the Buyer or its representatives or the Parents or the Buyers use
of any such information, including any confidential information memoranda
distributed on behalf of the Company, the Subsidiary or the Korean JV relating
to their respective businesses or other publications or data room (including
any electronic or "virtual" data room) information provided or made available
to the Parent or the Buyer or its representatives, or any other document or
information in any form provided or made available to the Parent or the Buyer
or its representatives, including management

 



      
 

 



 

presentations, in connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

6.8 _Financing_. The Buyer has sufficient cash and credit lines available for
the Buyer to deliver the Purchase Price and the Settlement Amounts in full and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the date
of this Agreement, neither the Parent nor the Buyer has reason to believe that
the Buyer will not be able to pay the Purchase Price and the Settlement
Amounts.

 



 

6.9 _Solvency_. After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Parent, the Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary (a) will be
solvent (in that both the fair value of its assets will not be less than the
sum of its liabilities and that the present saleable value of its assets will
not be less than the amount required to pay its probable liabilities as they
become absolute and matured), and (b) will have adequate capital with which to
engage in its business.

Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or
communicate to any Person other than authorized officers, directors and
employees of the Company, the Subsidiary or the Korean JV or use or otherwise
exploit for his, hers or its own benefit or for the benefit of anyone other
than Company, the Subsidiary or the Korean JV, any nonpublic information

 



      
 

 



 

in their possession regarding the Company, the Subsidiary or the Korean JV.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Seller has any obligation to keep
confidential (or cause its controlled Affiliates to keep confidential) any
such information if and to the extent disclosure thereof is specifically
required by an applicable Law or Order; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event disclosure is required by an applicable Law or Order, such Seller shall,
to the extent reasonably possible (and not inconsistent with the applicable
requirement of Law), provide the Buyer with prompt notice of such requirement
prior to making any disclosure so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate
protective order at its sole cost and expense. This _Section 7.2(e)_ shall
not restrict: (i) any Sellers disclosure of such information in connection
with such Sellers employment by the Company or the Subsidiary; (ii) any
Sellers disclosure of information regarding such Sellers investment in the
Company or the Subsidiary to such Sellers investors or prospective investors;
or (iii) limit any Sellers ability to invest in, consider investments in, or
to have relationships of any kind with, any other Person, including any Person
that may have technology, products, services or intellectual property that is
similar to, or complementary or competing with, that of the Company or the
Subsidiary or that are engaged in the same or related businesses as those
engaged in (or proposed to be engaged in) by the Company or the Subsidiary.

 



 

7.3 _Publicity_. Except as may be required to comply with the requirements of
any applicable Law, including the regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or the rules and
regulations of any stock exchange or national market system upon which the
securities of the Parent are listed, in the event that the Parent or the
Buyer, on the one hand, or the Company or any Seller, on the other hand,
intends to issue a press release or other public announcement relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, such
party will obtain the prior approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of, in the case of a press release or other public
announcement by the Parent or the Buyer, the Sellers Representative and, in
the case of a press release or other public announcement by the Company or any
Seller, the Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after the Closing, the
Sellers Representative and its Affiliates will be entitled to issue any such
press release or make any such other public announcement without obtaining
such prior approval so long as such release or announcement does not refer to
any of the economic terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(other than cash-on-cash returns and internal rates of return and other than
to the extent such information has been previously made public by the Buyer).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers acknowledge and agree that the Parent
is required to and will file this Agreement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Form 8-K after the signing of this Agreement.

 



 

7.4 _Records_. With respect to the financial books and records and minute

hours and upon reasonable notice.

 



      
 

 



 

7.5 _Update and Disclosure_. Prior to the Closing, the Company or the Sellers
Representative may deliver to the Buyer supplements or updates to the
Schedules; provided, that the delivery of any such supplemented or updated
Schedules pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ will not be deemed to have cured any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification or termination rights
contained in this Agreement or of determining whether or not the conditions
set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ have been satisfied.

 



 

7.6 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) For six years after the Closing Date, the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors, managers, officers and employees of the Company and the Subsidiary
to the same extent such Persons are indemnified or have the right to
advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement by the Company and
the Subsidiary pursuant to the Companys and the Subsidiarys certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
such directors, managers, officers and employees for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) The provisions of this _Section 7.6_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party or insured Person, his
or her heirs and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in

such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 7.6_, each indemnified party or insured Person and
his or her heirs and his or her representatives entitled to recourse or
indemnification under this _Section 7.6_, shall first seek such recourse and
indemnification under any applicable insurance policies held or maintained by
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates and the Companys obligations under
this _Section 7.6_ shall only apply to any indemnifiable amounts such Person
is entitled to under this _Section 7.6_ but which were not actually received
from the applicable insurance policies of the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates.

 



 

7.7 _Efforts; Cooperation_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or

Governmental Authority, (b) obtaining the necessary consents from third
parties, provided, that the fees, costs and expenses of the Company, the
Subsidiary or any Seller to obtain any such consents from third parties shall

commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any action, including

or representative retained by them to take, directly or indirectly, any action
to encourage, initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or

(v) Except in the case of Fraud, in no event shall any Seller or any successor
or assignee thereof have any liability hereunder in excess of the portion of
the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller under _Article II_ (which
amount, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include such Sellers Seller Pro
Rata Portions of the Indemnity Escrow Amount and Holdback Amount).

 



 

(vi) The Seller Indemnitees and the Buyer Indemnitees right to
indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.1_ and _Section 10.2_, respectively,
will be reduced by the amount actually received from a third party (including
an insurance company), with respect to the settlement or resolution of a claim
for which the Seller Indemnitees or the Buyer Indemnitees, as the case may be,
were entitled to indemnification hereunder. The Buyer shall use reasonable
efforts to pursue recovery from such third parties (and under all insurance
policies) and the Buyer shall remit to the Sellers any such third party
proceeds that are paid to any of the Buyer Indemnitees with respect to any
Losses for which any of the Buyer Indemnitees has been previously compensated
pursuant to _Section 10.2_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Seller Indemnitees or the Buyer Indemnitees be required to pursue recovery
from any third party (including an insurance company) prior to seeking and
receiving indemnification hereunder.

 



 

(vii) The Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_ on
account of any Losses will be reduced by the net amount of the Tax benefits
actually realized by any of the Buyer Indemnitees or their Affiliates by
reason of the related Losses in or before the taxable year in which the Losses
occur.

 



 

(viii) The Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to _Section
10.2_ on account of any Losses will be reduced by the amount of any reserve
reflected on the Company Financial Statements established for the general
category of items or matters similar in nature to the specific items or
matters giving rise to such Loss.

 



 

(ix) The Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 10.2_ to the extent the Buyer was compensated therefor pursuant to
_Section 2.3_.

 



 

(x) Except in the case of a breach of or inaccuracy in any of the
representations or warranties in _Section 5.22_ or Fraud by the Company or
the Sellers, the Buyer Indemnitees are not entitled to indemnification for any
Losses incurred from, arising out of or based upon any Asbestos Use, and no
Buyer Indemnitee will pursue any claim under this Agreement or otherwise
against the Sellers for indemnification under any theory of liability related
to the Asbestos Use.

 



 

(xi) Except to the extent (A) attributable to any breach of _Sections 5.9(e)_
, _5.9(m)(ii)_ , _5.9(m)(iii)_ , _5.9(m)(v)_ or (B) any amount paid by the
Buyer pursuant to _Section 11.10_, the Sellers will not have any liability
pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

 _Sections 10.2(a)(i)_ or _10.2(a)(v)(C)_ with respect to any Tax or Losses
related to Taxes for any taxable period or portion thereof that begins after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(xii) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to be compensated more than
once for the same Loss.

 



 

(xiii) The Indemnitees are not entitled to indemnification for lost income,
revenues or profits, multiples of earnings damages, diminution of value,
punitive damages, exemplary damages, incidental damages, consequential
damages, special damages and indirect damages.

 



 

10.4 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Notice of Losses by Seller Indemnitee_. As soon as reasonably practicable
after a Seller Indemnitee has actual knowledge of any claim that it has under
this _Article X_ that may result in a Loss (a " **Claim** "), the Sellers
Representative shall give written notice thereof (a " **Claims Notice** ") to
the Buyer. A Claims Notice must describe the Claim in reasonable detail, and
indicate the amount (estimated, as necessary and to the extent feasible) of
the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the applicable Seller Indemnitee.
The Sellers Representative shall provide a Claims Notice to the Buyer pursuant
to this _Section 10.4(a)_ within 30 days after discovery of such Claim by a
Seller Indemnitee; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall
not limit the right of such Seller Indemnitee to recover indemnity or
reimbursement hereunder except to the extent that the Buyer suffers any
material prejudice or material harm with respect to such claim as a result of
such failure. The Buyer shall respond to the Sellers Representative (a "
**Claim Response** ") within 30 days (the " **Response Period** ") after the
date that the Claims Notice is sent by the Sellers Representative. Any Claim
Response must specify whether or not the Buyer disputes the Claim described in
the Claims Notice. If the Buyer fails to give a Claim Response within the
Response Period, the Buyer will be deemed not to dispute the Claim described
in the related Claims Notice. If the Buyer elects not to dispute a Claim
described in a Claims Notice, whether by failing to give a timely Claim
Response or otherwise, then the amount of Losses alleged in such Claims Notice
will be conclusively deemed to be an obligation of the Buyer, and the Buyer
shall pay, in cash, to the Sellers Representative within 15 days after the
last day of the applicable Response Period the amount specified in the Claims
Notice. If the Buyer delivers a Claim Response within the Response Period
indicating that it disputes one or more of the matters identified in the
Claims Notice, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall promptly meet
and use their reasonable efforts to settle the dispute. If the Buyer and the
Sellers Representative are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after the
conclusion of the Response Period, then either the Buyer or the Sellers
Representative may resort to other legal remedies subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article X_.

 



 

(b) _Notice of Losses by Buyer Indemnitee_.

 



 

(i) _Claims with Determinable Losses_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Article X_, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith that it has

 



      
 

 



 

a claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 10.2_ (a " **Buyer Claim**
"), the amount of which is then known, the Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably
practicable after it becomes aware of such Buyer Claim, notify the Sellers
Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable, of such Buyer Claim by
means of a written notice describing the Buyer Claim in reasonable detail and
setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of the Losses incurred by the
applicable Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto (a " **Buyer Claim Notice** "
and, together with a Claims Notice, a " **Notice** "). The Buyer shall provide
a Buyer Claim Notice pursuant to this _Section 10.4(b)(i)_ within 30 days
after discovery of such Claim by a Buyer Indemnitee; provided, however, that
failure to give such notice shall not limit the right of such Buyer Indemnitee
to recover indemnity or reimbursement hereunder except to the extent that the
Seller Representative or breaching Seller, as applicable, suffers any material
prejudice or material harm with respect to such claim as a result of such
failure. If, by the 30th day following receipt by the Sellers Representative
or the breaching Seller, as applicable, of a Buyer Claim Notice (the "
**Dispute Period** "), the Buyer has not received from the Sellers
Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable, notice in writing that
the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable, objects to
the Buyer Claim (or the amount of Losses set forth in the Buyer Claim)
asserted in such Buyer Claim Notice (a " **Dispute Notice** "), then (x) if
such Buyer Claim shall have been made prior to the Escrow Termination Date,
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Amount the amount of Losses specified in the
Buyer Claim Notice, subject to the limitations contained in this _Article X_,
and (y) if such Buyer Claim shall have been made after the Escrow Termination
Date or to the extent it is in respect of amounts in excess of the then
available Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Sellers or the breaching Seller, as
applicable, shall be obligated to pay to the Buyer the amount of Losses
specified in the Buyer Claim Notice subject to the limitations contained in
this _Article X_.

 



 

(ii) _Claims without Determinable Losses_. Subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article X_, if any Buyer Indemnitee believes in good faith
that it has a Buyer Claim the amount of which cannot reasonably be determined,
the Buyer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of
such Buyer Claim, notify the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller,
as applicable, by means of a Buyer Claim Notice that contains the information
required by _Section 10.4(b)(i)_ and a good faith estimate, if possible, of
the Buyers calculation of the Losses incurred by the applicable Buyer
Indemnitee with respect to such Buyer Claim. The Buyer shall provide a Buyer
Claim Notice under this _Section 10.4(b)(ii)_ within 30 days after discovery
of such Claim by a Buyer Indemnitee; provided, however, that failure to give
such notice shall not limit the right of such Buyer Indemnitee to recover
indemnity or reimbursement hereunder except to the extent that the Seller
Representative or breaching Seller, as applicable, suffers any material
prejudice or material harm with respect to such claim as a result of such
failure. If the Buyer has not received a Dispute Notice from the Sellers
Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable,

 



      
 

 



 

within the Dispute Period, then (x) if such Buyer Claim shall have been made
prior to the Escrow Termination Date, the Sellers Representative and the Buyer
shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Amount the amount
of Losses specified from time-to-time as the amount of any such Buyer Claim
becomes known, subject to the limitations contained in this _Article X_, and
(y) if such Buyer Claim shall have been made after the Escrow Termination Date
or to the extent it is in respect of amounts in excess of the then available
Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Sellers or the breaching Seller, as applicable,
shall be obligated to pay to the Buyer the amount of Losses specified from
time to time as the amount of any such Buyer Claim becomes known, subject to
the limitations contained in this _Article X_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable, will be
under no obligation to agree to any such payments under the immediately
preceding clauses (x) or (y), and the making of any one such payment will be
without prejudice to the continuing right of the Sellers Representative or the
breaching Seller, as applicable, to object to any further payment.

 



 

(iii) _Disputes_. If the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller, as
applicable, delivers a Dispute Notice to the Buyer within the Dispute Period,
the Buyer and the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller, as
applicable, shall promptly meet and use their reasonable efforts to settle the
dispute as to whether and to what extent the Buyer Indemnitees are entitled to
reimbursement on account of such Buyer Claim. If the Buyer and the Sellers
Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable, are able to reach
agreement within 30 days after the Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then
(x) if such Buyer Claim shall have been made prior to the Escrow Termination
Date, the Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall deliver a joint written
instruction to the Escrow Agent setting forth such agreement and instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay to the Buyer from the Indemnity Escrow Amount an
amount in accordance with such agreement, subject to the limitations contained
in this _Article X_, and (y) if such Buyer Claim shall have been made after
the Escrow Termination Date or to the extent it is in respect of amounts in
excess of the then available Indemnity Escrow Amount, the Sellers or the
breaching Seller, as applicable, shall pay to the Buyer an amount in
accordance with such agreement, subject to the limitations contained in this
_Article X_. If the Buyer and the Sellers Representative or the breaching
Seller, as applicable, are unable to reach agreement within 30 days after the
Buyer receives such Dispute Notice, then either the Buyer, on the one hand, or
the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller, as applicable, on the
other hand, may resort to other legal remedies, subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Article X_. For all purposes of this _Article X_ (including
those pertaining to disputes under _Section 10.4(a)_ and this _Section
10.4(b)_), the Buyer and the Sellers Representative or the breaching Seller,
as applicable, shall cooperate with and make available to the other party and
its respective representatives all information, records and data, and shall
permit reasonable access to its facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably
required in connection with the resolution of such disputes.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Opportunity to Defend Third Party Claims_. Subject to _Section 11.3_, in
the event of any claim by a third party against a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller
Indemnitee for which indemnification is available hereunder, the Buyer or the
Sellers Representative from which indemnification is sought, as applicable
(each an " **Indemnifying Party** "), has the right, exercisable by written
notice to the Buyer or the Sellers Representative (or the breaching Seller, as
applicable) within 60 days of receipt of a Notice from the Buyer or the
Sellers Representative, as applicable, to assume and conduct the defense of
such claim with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party provided that the
Indemnifying Party provides assurance reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee
that such indemnification will be paid by the Indemnifying Party fully and
promptly if required. In the case of the foregoing, counsel for the defense of
such a Claim shall be selected by the Indemnifying Party (subject to the
consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
and it being understood that Jones Day is acceptable counsel for any Seller
Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
control, at its sole cost and expense, the defense of the third party claim
for so long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting a good faith and diligent
defense of such third party claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume control of such defense
if the third-party claim which the Indemnifying Party seeks to assume control
(i) seeks injunctive or other nonmonetary relief as a principal component of
its demand or relief, (ii) involves criminal or quasi-criminal allegations,
(iii) involves a claim which, if adversely, determined, would be reasonably
expected to establish a precedent, custom or practice materially adverse to
the continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, or (iv) could
reasonably be anticipated in good faith to result in Losses that would exceed
an amount that, when taken together with the outstanding aggregate pending
amount of such claim, exceeds the potential liability of the Indemnifying
Party for such claim or related claims. If the Indemnifying Party is the
Sellers Representative (on behalf of the Sellers), such Indemnifying Party
will be entitled to defend and settle such claim using the Indemnity Escrow
Amount, and the Sellers Representative and the Buyer shall jointly instruct
the Escrow Agent to release funds held under the Escrow Agreement for this
purpose from time to time in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party is the Buyer, such
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to defend such claim using the
Indemnity Escrow Amount. If the Indemnifying Party has assumed such defense as
provided in this _Section 10.4(c)_, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnitee in connection
with the defense of such Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the
defense of any third party claim in accordance with this _Section 10.4(c)_,
the Indemnitee may continue to defend such claim at the sole cost of the
Indemnifying Party (subject to the limitations set forth in this _Article X_)
and the Indemnifying Party may still participate in, but not control, the
defense of such third party claim at the Indemnifying Partys sole cost and
expense. The Indemnitee will not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any such claim, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), no Indemnifying Party, in
the defense of any such claim, will consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement that (i) provides for injunctive or other
nonmonetary relief affecting

 



      
 

 



 

the Indemnitee or (ii) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release from all
liability with respect to such claim or litigation. In any such third party
claim, the party responsible for the defense of such claim (the "
**Responsible Party** ") shall, to the extent reasonably requested by the
other party, keep such other party informed as to the status of such claim,
including all settlement negotiations and offers. With respect to a third
party claim for which the Sellers Representative is the party responsible for
the defense, the Buyer shall use all reasonable efforts to make available to
the Sellers Representative and its representatives all books and records of
the Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary relating to such third party claim
and shall cooperate with the Sellers Representative in the defense of the
third party claim.

 



 

(d) _Settlement_. The Responsible Party shall promptly notify the other party
of each settlement offer with respect to a third party claim. Such other party
shall promptly notify the Responsible Party whether or not such party is
willing to accept the proposed settlement offer. If the Sellers Representative
is willing to accept the proposed settlement offer but the Buyer refuses to
accept such settlement offer, then if (i) such settlement offer requires only
the payment of money damages and provides a complete release of all
Indemnitees that are a party to such third party claim with respect to the
subject matter thereof, (ii) the Sellers Representative agrees in writing that
the entire amount of such proposed settlement constitutes Losses that are
recoverable from the Indemnity Escrow Amount then available for distribution,
subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, and (iii) the amount of
such proposed settlement will not exceed the limitations contained in this
_Article X_, then the amount payable to the Indemnitees with respect to such
third party claim will be limited to the amount of such settlement offer
subject to the limitations contained in this _Article X_. The Sellers
Representative may nevertheless propose in writing a good faith, reasonable
settlement offer that requires only the payment of money damages and provides
a complete release of all Indemnitees who are parties to such third party
claim with respect to the subject matter thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (A) the Sellers Representative agrees in writing that the entire amount
of such proposed settlement constitutes Losses that are reimbursable from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount then available for distribution, subject to the other
provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount of any such proposed
settlement offer may not exceed the limitations contained in this _Article
X_. If the Buyer refuses to agree to or make the proposed settlement offer to
the claimant in the third party claim, any amount payable to a Buyer
Indemnitee with respect to such third party claim will be limited to the
amount of such proposed settlement offer. If any such settlement offer is made
to any claimant and rejected by such claimant, the amount payable to an
Indemnitee with respect to such claim will not be limited to the amount of
such settlement offer but will remain subject to all other limitations set
forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Other Releases of Escrow Funds_. All funds held under the Escrow
Agreement _minus_ the amounts of any unresolved Buyer Claims set forth in any
then pending Buyer Claims Notices shall be released, pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement, to the Sellers upon joint written instruction from the Buyer and
the Sellers Representative on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " **Escrow Termination Date** "). With respect to the Optionholders, the
Optionholders Seller Pro Rata Share shall be

 



      
 

 



 

released to the Company, and the Company shall, in turn, pay or cause the
Subsidiary to pay such amounts (subject to applicable withholding Tax), to the
Optionholders as promptly thereafter as practicable by the methods set forth
in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_, but in no event later than four (4) Business Days
following the date on which the Company received such amounts from the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this _Section 10.4(e)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amount shall be released under the Escrow Agreement to an Optionholder in his,
her or its capacity as such, after the fifth anniversary of the Closing.

 



 

10.5 _Exclusive Remedy_. The parties agree that, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties hereto for any Losses based
upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of the matters set forth in this
Agreement (including the Schedules and exhibits attached hereto and the
certificates delivered pursuant hereto) or the transactions contemplated
hereby are the indemnification obligations of the parties set forth in this
_Article X_. Except with respect to Claims for indemnification under this
_Article X_ for a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty
in _Section 5.22_, the Buyer Indemnitees expressly waive any and all rights
and remedies against the Sellers related to Asbestos Use and under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42
U.S.C. §601 _et seq_. and other Environmental Laws. The provisions of this
_Section 10.5_ will not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action (a)
under _Section 12.16_ to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, (b) under _Section 2.3_ to enforce any decision or
determination of the Arbitration Firm or (c) seeking any remedy based upon
Fraud by any other party hereto.

 



 

10.6 _Subrogation_. Upon making any indemnity payment pursuant to _Section
10.1_ or _Section 10.2_, as applicable, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees, as applicable, against any third
party in respect of the Losses to which the payment related. The parties
hereto will execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above described subrogation rights.

 



 

10.7 _Mitigation_. Any Indemnitees shall take all commercially reasonable
steps to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
may be indemnifiable or reimbursable hereunder.

 



 

10.8 _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. All indemnification payments or
reimbursements made pursuant to this _Article X_ or _Article XI_ will be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price unless otherwise required by
applicable Law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

11.1 _Reserved_.

 



 

11.2 _Cooperation; Audits_.

 



 

(a) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns, audit examinations, and
any administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities
imposed on

 



      
 

 



 

the Company or the Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, the Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall cooperate reasonably
with each other, including the furnishing or making available during normal
business hours of records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of
account, powers of attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the
preparation of such Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the
defense of claims by Taxing Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. The
Buyer shall and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiary to (i) retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the
Subsidiary relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by the Sellers Representative, any extension thereof) for the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any Taxing Authority and (ii) give the Sellers
Representative reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and shall allow the Sellers
Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(b) The Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall, upon the others request,
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

11.3 _Controversies_. Notwithstanding _Section 10.4_, this _Section 11.3_
shall control any inquiries, assessments, Proceedings or similar events with
respect to Taxes. After the Closing Date, (a) The Buyer, the Company and the
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Sellers, the Seller Representative and
their Affiliates, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon
receipt by such party of written notice of any notice of any inquiries,
assessments, proceedings or similar events received from any Taxing Authority
with respect to Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiary for which the Sellers
may be required to reimburse any Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to this Agreement,
or (b) the Buyer shall promptly notify the Sellers Representative prior to the
Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiary making any voluntary contact with any
Taxing Authority relating to a failure of the Company or the Subsidiary to
file a Tax Return or pay Taxes, or making any self-assessment of Taxes, for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (any matter set forth in clause
(a) or (b), a " **Tax Matter** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure
to provide such notice with respect to subclause (a) will not affect the
Buyers right to indemnification under _Section 10.2_ except to the extent
that the Sellers Representatives defense of such Tax Matter is demonstrably
prejudiced by such failure; _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to
provide such notice with respect to subclause (b) will negate the Buyers
right to indemnification under _Section 10.2_ with respect to Tax liabilities
resulting from the voluntary contact. The Sellers Representative may, at
Sellers expense, participate in and, upon notice to the Buyer, assume the
defense of any such Tax Matter. If the Sellers Representative assumes such
defense, the Sellers Representative shall have the authority, with respect to
any Tax Matter, to represent the interests of the Company and the Subsidiary
before the relevant Taxing Authority and the Sellers Representative shall have
the right to control the defense, compromise or other resolution of any such
Tax Matter subject to the limitations contained herein, including responding
to inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment
for additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes
of, or relating to, such

 



      
 

 



 

Tax Matter. If the Sellers Representative has assumed such defense, the
Sellers Representative will be entitled to defend and settle such Tax Matter
using the Indemnity Escrow Amount, and the Sellers Representative and the
Buyer shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to release funds held under the
Escrow Agreement from time to time for this purpose in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. The Buyer shall have
the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Tax Matter
and to employ counsel, solely at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Sellers Representative. The Sellers Representative shall not
enter into any settlement of or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter to
the extent that it adversely affects the Tax liability of the Buyer, the
Company, the Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the foregoing for a post-Closing
Tax period without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent shall
not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. The Sellers
Representative shall keep the Buyer informed with respect to the commencement,
status and nature of any such Tax Matter, and will, in good faith, allow the
Buyer to consult with it regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any
such proceeding. If the Sellers Representative does not assume the defense of
any such Tax Matter, then: (i) the Buyer shall not enter into any settlement
or otherwise compromise any such Tax Matter to the extent it adversely affects
the Tax liability of the Sellers without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed, (ii) the Sellers Representative shall have the right (but
not the duty) to participate in the defense of such Tax Matter and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by the Buyer, and
(iii) the Buyer shall keep the Sellers Representative informed with respect to
the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Matter, and will
reasonably cooperate with the Sellers Representative and consult with it
regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such proceeding.

 



 

11.4 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers Representative shall cause to be prepared and timely filed all
Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices
of the Company and the Subsidiary, unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. At least 45 calendar days prior to the due date (with applicable
extensions) of any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, the Sellers
Representative shall provide drafts of all such Tax Returns to the Buyer for
the Buyers review and comment. The Buyer shall provide any written comments
to the Sellers Representative not later than 15 days after receiving any such
Tax Return and, if the Buyer does not provide any written comments with 15
days, the Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such Tax Return. The parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax
Return. If the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute at least 15 days
before the due date (with applicable extensions) for any such Tax Return, the
dispute shall be referred to the Arbitration Firm for resolution and the fees
shall be shared one-half by the Sellers Representative and one-half by the
Buyer. Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, (i) none of the Buyer,
the Company, the Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates will elect to waive any
carryback of net operating losses under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) on any Tax Return of the
Company or the Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period in respect of losses
incurred in any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) the Company and the Subsidiary
shall report and deduct the Tax

 



       
 

 



 

Deductions on Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, and (iii) as part of the Tax Returns of the
Company and the Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer will
cooperate and file or cause to be filed, if applicable, IRS Form 4466
(Corporation Application for Quick Refund of Overpayment of Estimated Tax) in
respect of any taxable year ending on the Closing Date, IRS Form 8302
(Electronic Deposit of Tax Refund of $1 Million or More) and IRS Form 1139 for
any eligible carryback periods to the extent that such Tax Returns are
prepared by the Sellers Representative in accordance with this _Section
11.4(a)_.

 



 

(b) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, any Tax Return required to be filed by the Company or the
Subsidiary for a Straddle Period (a " **Straddle Period Tax Return** "). Such
Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practices of the Company and the Subsidiary, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. At least 45 calendar days prior to the due date (with
applicable extensions) of any Straddle Period Tax Return, the Buyer shall
provide drafts of all such Tax Returns to the Sellers Representative for the
Sellers Representatives review and comment. The Sellers Representative shall
provide any written comments to the Buyer not later than 15 days after
receiving any such Tax Return and, if the Sellers Representative does not
provide any written comments with 15 days, the Sellers Representative shall be
deemed to have accepted such Tax Return. The parties shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any dispute with respect to such Tax Return. If the parties
are unable to resolve any such dispute at least 15 days before the date (with
applicable extensions) for any such Tax Return, the dispute shall be referred
to the Arbitration Firm for resolution and the fees shall be shared one-half
by the Sellers Representative and one-half by the Buyer.

 



 

(c) Any payment of Taxes with respect to any Tax Return prepared pursuant to
this _Section 11.4_ will be paid pursuant to _Article X_.

 



 

(d) The portion of any Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that is
deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of Property Taxes,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and
(ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of
the Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

 



 

11.5 _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Neither the Buyer nor any of its Affiliates
shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election
of any of the Company or the Subsidiary with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period without obtaining the prior written consent of the Sellers
Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed.

 



 

11.6 _Certain Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, " **Transfer Taxes** ") will be paid one-half by the
Buyer and one-half by the Sellers when due, and all necessary Tax Returns and
other

 



      
 

 



 

documentation with respect to Transfer Taxes will be prepared and filed by the
party required to file such Tax Returns under applicable Law.

 



 

11.7 _Consolidated Income Tax Return_. The Buyer shall elect to file a
consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with the Company and the
Subsidiary for the taxable year of the Buyer that includes the day after the
Closing Date. The parties acknowledge and agree that, as a consequence of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) the taxable year of the Company and the
Subsidiary shall close for U.S. federal income tax purposes at the end of the
day on the Closing Date, (b) to the extent applicable Law in other taxing
jurisdictions so permits, the taxable year of the Company and the Subsidiary
shall close at the end of the day on the Closing Date, and (c) all federal,
state, local and foreign income Tax Returns shall be filed consistently on the
foregoing basis.

 



 

11.8 _Refunds_. Except to the extent any such Tax refund or credits of Tax
liability were specifically reflected in the Closing Working Capital and were
taken into account in determining the Purchase Price or arises as the result
of a carryback of a loss or other Tax attribute from a Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (other than a Realized Tax Benefit),
the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers Representative for further distribution to
the Stockholders and to the Company for further distribution to the
Optionholders (which the Company shall, in turn, pay or cause the Subsidiary
to pay to the Optionholders within four Business Days by the methods set forth
in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_), in each case, in their respective Seller Pro Rata
Portions, an amount equal to any Tax refunds or credits of Tax liability,
including interest paid therewith, in respect of Taxes paid by the Company or
the Subsidiary with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing
Straddle Period net of any out of pocket costs to Buyer and its Affiliates
attributable to the obtaining and receipt of such refund or credit. The Buyer
shall pay to the Sellers Representative and the Company the amount of any such
refund or credit within 15 days after receipt or entitlement thereto. The
parties agree that Tax refunds or credits of Tax liability for portion of the
Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be determined
using the methodologies consistent with those for determining Taxes relating
to such portion of any Straddle Period as set forth in _Section 11.4(d)_
above. The Buyer shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause the Company and
the Subsidiary to reasonably cooperate, with the Sellers Representative in
filing any claims for Tax refunds in respect of Taxes paid by the Company for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period.

 



 

11.9 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements (other than any Contract entered into in the ordinary course of
business and the principal purpose of which is not Taxes) between the Company
or any of the Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any of the Sellers and their
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date,
and, after the Closing Date, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiary
shall be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder.

 



 

11.10 _Tax Benefits_. After the Closing Date, the Buyer will pay to the
Sellers Representative for further distribution to the Stockholders and to the
Company for further distribution to the Optionholders (which the Company
shall, in turn, pay or cause the Subsidiary to pay to the Optionholders within
four (4) Business Days by the methods set forth in _Section 2.2(b)(ii)_), in
each case, in their respective Seller Pro Rata Portions, an amount in cash
equal to

 



      
 

 



 

the Realized Tax Benefits within 15 days after filing any Tax Return
(including any payment of estimated Taxes) on which a Realized Tax Benefit is
reflected.

 



 

11.11 _Treatment as Purchase Price Adjustment_. For Tax purposes, the parties
agree to treat all payments made under this _Article XI_ as adjustments to
the Purchase Price to the greatest extent permitted by Law.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII 
MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL**

 



 

12.1 _Sellers Representative_.

 



 

(a) The Sellers hereby constitute and appoint the Sellers Representative as
agent and attorney in fact for and on behalf of the other Sellers. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers Representative has full
power and authority, on behalf of each Seller and his, her or its successors
and assigns, to (i) interpret the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
the documents to be executed and delivered by or on behalf of the Sellers in
connection herewith, including the Escrow Agreement and the agreement entered
into by the Sellers Representative with the Escrow Agent with respect to the
administration of the Holdback Amount (the " **Holdback Agreement** "), (ii)
execute and deliver and receive deliveries of all agreements, certificates,
statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments,
and other documents required or permitted to be given in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the Holdback Agreement, (iii) receive service of process in
connection with any claims under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Holdback Agreement, (iv) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, assume the defense of claims, and demand arbitration and
comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such
claims, and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of
the Sellers Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing, (v) give
and receive notices and communications, (vi) authorize delivery to the Buyer
of the Indemnity Escrow Amount or any portion thereof in satisfaction of
claims brought by the Buyer for Losses, (vii) object to such deliveries,
(viii) distribute the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount
and any earnings and proceeds thereon, (ix) administer, deduct, hold back
and/or redirect any funds, including the Holdback Amount, which may be payable
to any Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement,
the Holdback Agreement or any agreements or documents executed and delivered
in connection herewith in order to pay, or establish a reserve for, (A) any
amount that may be payable by such Seller hereunder or (B) any costs, fees,
expenses and other liabilities incurred by the Sellers Representative (in its
capacity as such) in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or
the Holdback Agreement or its rights or obligations hereunder and thereunder,
and (x) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Sellers Representative on behalf of the Sellers in connection with this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Holdback Agreement, including bringing
claims against the Buyer pursuant to _Section 10.1_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Such agency may be changed by the holders of a majority in interest of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount (the " **Majority-in-Interest** ") from time to time
upon not less than five days prior written notice to the Buyer. The Sellers
Representative, or any successor hereafter appointed, may resign at any time
by written notice to the Buyer. A successor Sellers Representative will be
named by a Majority-in-Interest. All power, authority, rights and privileges
conferred in this Agreement to the Sellers Representative will apply to any
successor Sellers Representative.

 



 

(c) The Sellers Representative will not be liable for any act done or omitted
under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Holdback Agreement as
Sellers Representative while acting in good faith, and any act taken or
omitted to be taken pursuant to the advice of counsel will be conclusive
evidence of such good faith. The Buyer agrees that it will not look to the
personal assets of the Sellers Representative, acting in such capacity, for
the satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the Company (pre-
Closing) or the Sellers. In performing any of its duties under this Agreement
or any agreements or documents executed and delivered in connection herewith,
the Sellers Representative will not be liable to the Sellers for any Losses
that such Person may incur as a result of any act, or failure to act, by the
Sellers Representative under this Agreement or any agreements or documents
executed and delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow
Agreement), and the Sellers Representative will be indemnified and held
harmless by the Sellers for all Losses, except to the extent that the actions
or omissions of the Sellers Representative were taken or omitted not in good
faith. The limitation of liability provisions of this _Section 12.1(c)_ will
survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Sellers
Representative.

 



 

(d) If the Buyer is paid or distributed any portion of the Indemnity Escrow
Amount in satisfaction of Losses resulting from an inaccuracy or a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in _Article IV_ or a breach by a
Seller of a covenant contained in this Agreement, the breaching Seller will
indemnify each non-breaching Seller in an amount equal to the product of (a)
the portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount paid or distributed to the Buyer
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as a result of such breach or inaccuracy and
(b) the percentage applicable to such non-breaching Seller based on the Seller
Pro Rata Portion, and the Sellers Representative may adjust releases of the
Indemnity Escrow Amount or the Holdback Amount (as well as any other payments
or adjustments of Purchase Price hereunder) as necessary to address any such
indemnification obligation that has not been satisfied. For the avoidance of
doubt, this _Section 12.1(d)_ shall in no way limit the Buyers rights to
indemnification pursuant to _Article X_, including in the event that any non-
breaching Seller is unsuccessful in recovering amounts contemplated by this
_Section 12.1(d)_.

 



 

(e) Following the payment by the Sellers Representative of any expenses
incurred by the Sellers Representative in the course of performing its
obligations under this Agreement, the Sellers Representative shall distribute
(i) the Optionholders Seller Pro Rata Share of the Remaining Holdback Amount,
if any, to the Company and the Buyer shall cause the Company to (A) pay or
cause the Subsidiary to pay such amount to the Optionholders, less any
applicable Taxes required to be withheld, as promptly as

 



      
 

 



 

practicable thereafter, and (B) pay such withheld Taxes to the proper Taxing
Authority, and (ii) to each Stockholder its respective pro rata share (based
on the Seller Pro Rata Portions) of the remaining Holdback Amount, if any. The
Sellers Representative may make such distributions in multiple pro rata
installments as the Sellers Representative deems prudent in the circumstances.

 



 

(f) Any and all actions taken or not taken, exercises of rights, power or
authority and any decision or determination made by the Sellers Representative
in connection herewith shall be absolutely and irrevocably binding upon the
Sellers as if such Person had taken such action, exercised such rights, power
or authority or made such decision or determination in its individual
capacity, and the Escrow Agent and the Buyer may rely upon such action,
exercise of right, power, or authority or such decision or determination of
the Sellers Representative as the action, exercise, right, power, or
authority, or decision or determination of such Person, and no Seller shall
have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The
Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by
the Sellers Representative and any acts done by the Buyer in accordance with
any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

 



 

12.2 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all costs and expenses (including all legal,
accounting, broker, finder or investment banker fees) incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are to be paid by
the party incurring such expenses except as expressly provided herein.

 



 

12.3 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, but no party may assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto.

 



 

12.4 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.6_, each
party hereto intends that this Agreement does not benefit or create any right
or cause of action in or on behalf of any Person other than the parties
hereto.

 



 

12.5 _Further Assurances_ **.** The parties shall execute such further
instruments and take such further actions as may reasonably be necessary to
carry out the intent of this Agreement. Each party hereto shall cooperate
affirmatively with the other parties, to the extent reasonably requested by
such other parties, to enforce rights and obligations herein provided.

 



 

12.6 _Notices_. Any notice or other communication provided for herein or given
hereunder to a party hereto must be in writing, and (a) sent by facsimile

to be decided by the Arbitration Firm pursuant to _Section 2.3(c)_, the
parties hereto hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery or, if jurisdiction is unavailable in the Delaware Court of
Chancery, the courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware or,
if jurisdiction is unavailable in the courts of the United States located in
the State of Delaware, the Delaware Superior Court, in each case, in respect

Closing Date, or (b) any other remedy to which they are entitled hereunder
after the Closing Date.

 



 

12.17 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT

UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
HERETO MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HERETO HAS BEEN

negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of

shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of

"including" (or any other tense or variation of the word "include") in this
Agreement shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article, Section, Exhibit or Schedule
of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The words "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as to the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as the feminine and neuter genders of such terms.

 



 

12.19 _Conflict of Interest_. It is acknowledged by each of the parties hereto
that the Sellers Representative has retained Jones Day to act as its counsel
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer hereby
agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between the
Buyer, the Company and the Subsidiary, on the one hand,

 



      
 

 



 

and the Sellers Representative and the Sellers, on the other hand, Jones Day
may represent the Sellers Representative and the Sellers in such dispute, even
though the interests of the Sellers Representative and the Sellers may be
directly adverse to the Company and the Subsidiary, and even though Jones Day
may have represented the Company or the Subsidiary in a matter substantially
related to such dispute, or may be handling ongoing matters for the Company or
the Subsidiary. The Buyer further agrees that, as to all communications among
Jones Day, the Company, the Subsidiary, the Sellers Representative and the
Sellers that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to the Sellers Representative and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Buyer, the Company or the Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the Buyer, the Company
and the Subsidiary, on the one hand, and a third party other than the Sellers
Representative or any Seller, on the other hand, the Buyer, the Company and
the Subsidiary may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure
of confidential communications to such third party and none of the Buyer, the
Company or the Subsidiary may waive such privilege without the prior written
consent of the Sellers Representative.

 



 

12.20 _Release_. Effective upon the Closing, each Seller and such Sellers
successors and assigns, each hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases
and forever discharges the Buyer, the Parent, the Company, the Subsidiary and
each of their respective controlled Affiliates from any and all charges,
complaints, causes of action, Losses, damages, agreements and liabilities of
any kind or nature whatsoever (" **Seller Released Claims** "), whether known
or unknown and whether at law or in equity, relating to or arising from any
matter existing prior to the Closing with respect to such Sellers ownership
of the Shares or the Options; provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Section 12.20 shall constitute a release, waiver or discharge of (a) any
Seller Released Claim in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (including claims that the Sellers may
bring or have for indemnification under Article X), or (ii) the Buyers, the
Parents, the Companys or the Subsidiarys obligations to such Seller or such
Sellers respective successors or assigns under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

12.21 _Parent Guaranty_.

 



 

(a) The Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees
full performance by the Buyer of all of the Buyers covenants, agreements and
other obligations hereunder, including the due, punctual and full payment and
performance and collection of the Buyers (including its permitted designees
and assigns) obligations hereunder when due, including payment of the Purchase
Price and the Settlement Amounts. This guaranty is an absolute, direct,
unconditional and immediate guarantee of payment and performance, and not just
of collection, and the Parent acknowledges and agrees that this guaranty is
full and unconditional, and no release or extinguishment of the Buyers and/or
its designees or assigns liabilities or other obligations (other than in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), whether by decree in any
bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, will affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guaranty.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Without limiting in any way the foregoing guaranty, the Parent agrees to
cause, and to take all actions to enable, the Buyer to adhere to each
provision of this Agreement which requires an act or omission on the part of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates to cause or enable the Buyer to comply with
its obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Parent hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any right to
require the Sellers, as a condition of payment or performance by the Parent of
any obligations of the Buyer hereunder, to proceed against the Buyer or pursue
any other remedy whatsoever in the event that the Buyer fails to perform its
obligations hereunder, (ii) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by Law which
limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors or sureties, (iii) any and all
notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of any guaranty
obligations pursuant to this _Section 12.21_, (iv) notice of or proof of
reliance by any Seller upon the guaranty or acceptance of this guaranty, (v)
presentment for payment, notice of non-payment or non-performance, demand,
protest, notice of protest and notice of dishonor or default to anyone, (vi)
defenses to pay or perform based upon any of the obligations not being a valid
and binding obligation of the Buyer enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms, and (vii) any allegation or contest of the validity of this
guaranty.
