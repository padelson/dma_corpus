_Determination of Adjustment Amount and Purchase Price_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) No later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller,
in consultation with Parent and Buyer, will prepare and deliver to Buyer and
Parent, Sellers best estimate of the Actual Working Capital, the Actual
Capital Expenditures, the Unrecovered Fuel Adjustment, the Unrecovered
Purchased Gas Adjustment, the Lease Buy-Out Amount, the Adjustment Amount and
the Purchase Price to be paid at the Closing, based on Sellers best estimates
of the Adjustment Amount (such estimated Purchase Price being referred to
herein as the " _Closing Payment Amount_ ").

  

(b) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare
and deliver to Parent a statement (the " _Proposed Adjustment Statement_ ")
that reflects Buyers determination of (i) the Actual Working Capital, the
Actual Capital Expenditures, the Unrecovered Fuel Adjustment, the Unrecovered
Purchased Gas Adjustment, the Lease Buy-Out Amount and the Adjustment Amount
(the " _Proposed Adjustment Amount_ "), and (ii) the Purchase Price based on
the Proposed Adjustment Amount (the " _Proposed Purchase Price_ "). In
addition, Buyer will provide Parent with supporting assumptions and
calculations, in reasonable detail, for such determinations at the time it
delivers the Proposed Adjustment Statement. Parent and Seller agree to, and
Parent agrees to cause Sellers successor to, cooperate with Buyer after the
Closing in connection with the preparation of the Proposed Adjustment
Statement and related information, and will provide Buyer with access to
Sellers books, records, information, and employees that are primarily related
to the Business and the Purchased Assets that are in Sellers or its
successors possession or control as Buyer may reasonably request.

  

(c) The amounts determined by Buyer as set forth in the Proposed
Adjustment Statement will be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes
unless, and only to the extent, that within thirty (30) days after Buyer has
delivered the Proposed Adjustment Statement, Parent notifies Buyer of any
dispute with matters set forth in the Proposed Adjustment Statement. Any such
notice of dispute delivered by Parent (an " _Adjustment Dispute Notice_ ")
will identify with reasonable specificity each item in the Proposed Adjustment
Statement with respect to which Parent disagrees, the reason for such
disagreement, and Parents position with respect to such disputed item, and
will include Parents recalculation of the Adjustment Amount and the
Purchase Price. Parent shall be conclusively deemed to have accepted any item
in the Proposed Adjustment Statement not addressed by the Adjustment Dispute
Notice.

  

(d) If Parent delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice in compliance with
Section 3.2(c), Buyer and Parent will attempt to reconcile their differences
and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts will be final, binding,
and conclusive for all purposes on the Parties. If Buyer and Parent are unable
to reach a resolution with respect to all disputed items within forty five
(45) days of delivery of the Adjustment Dispute Notice, Buyer and Parent will
submit any items remaining in dispute for determination and resolution to the
Independent Accounting Firm, which will be instructed to determine and report
to the Parties, within thirty (30) days after such submission, upon such
remaining disputed items. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm
on each issue shall be neither more favorable to Buyer than shown in the
Proposed Adjustment Statement nor more favorable to Parent than shown in the
Adjustment Dispute Notice. The report of the Independent Accounting Firm will
identify the correct Actual Working Capital, Actual Capital Expenditures,
Unrecovered Fuel Adjustment,

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

23 

---|--- 
 

  

   

Unrecovered Purchased Gas Adjustment, Lease Buy-Out Amount, Adjustment Amount
and Purchase Price (the " _Correct Purchase Price_ ") and such report will be
final, binding, and conclusive on the Parties for all purposes. The fees and
disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated between
Buyer and Parent so that Parents share of such fees and disbursements will be
in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed
items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully
disputed by Parent (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm)
bears to the total amount of the disputed amounts so submitted to the
Independent Accounting Firm, with the remaining amount allocated to Buyer.

  

(e) " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean (i) the Proposed Purchase
Price, if Parent does not deliver an Adjustment Dispute Notice; (ii) the
amount agreed between Parent and Purchaser, if any; or (iii) the Correct
Purchase Price, if determined by the Independent Accounting Firm. Within five
(5) days following the final determination of the Final Purchase Price
pursuant to Sections 3.2(b), (c) and (d), (x) if the Final Purchase Price is
greater than the Closing Payment Amount, Buyer will pay the difference to
Seller or its successor; or (y) if the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Closing Payment Amount, Parent will cause Seller, or its successor, to pay the
difference to Buyer. Any amount paid under this Section 3.2(e) will be paid
with interest for the period commencing on the Closing Date through the date
of payment, calculated at the Prime Rate in effect on the Closing Date, in
cash by wire transfer of same day funds to the account specified by the Party
receiving payment.

  

3.3 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. The sum of the Purchase Price
and the Assumed Obligations will be allocated among the Purchased Assets on a
basis consistent with section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations
promulgated thereunder. Within one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Closing Date, the Parties will work together in good faith to agree upon such
allocation; provided that in the event that such agreement has not been
reached within such 180-day period, the allocation will be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm, and such determination will be binding on the
Parties. Parent and Buyer will each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with such determination. Each
Party will, and Parent will cause Sellers successor to, report the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement for federal Income Tax and all
other Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such allocation. Each Party
will provide the other promptly with any other information required to
complete Form 8594 under the Code. Each Party will notify the other, and will
provide the other with reasonably requested cooperation, in the event of an
examination, audit, or other proceeding regarding the allocations provided for
in this Section 3.3.

---|---|--- 
 

  

(b) In connection with any real property Tax prorations pursuant to
Section 3.4(a), including installments of special assessments, the amount
allocated to Buyer shall equal the amount of the current real property Tax or
installment of special assessments, as the case may be, multiplied by a
fraction, (i) the numerator of which is the number of days from the date of
the immediately preceding installment to the day before the Closing Date, and
(ii) the denominator of which is the total number of days in the assessment
period in which the Closing Date occurs. In connection with any other
prorations, in the event that actual amounts are not available at the Closing
Date, the proration will be based upon the Taxes, assessments, charges, fees,
or rents for the most recent period completed prior to the Closing Date for
which actual Taxes, assessments, charges, fees, or rents are available. All
prorations will be based upon the most recent available Tax rates,
assessments, and valuations.

  

(c) Parent agrees to cause Seller or its successor to furnish Buyer,
and Buyer agrees to cause the Companies to furnish Parent, with such documents
and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all
proration calculations made pursuant to this Section 3.4.

no provision of any Benefit Plan would require the payment by Buyer, the
Companies or such Benefit Plan of any money or other property, or the
provision by Buyer, the Companies or such Benefit Plan of any other rights or
benefits, to or on behalf of any Business Employee or any other employee or
former employee of Seller solely as a result of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute
payment within the meaning of section 280G of the Code.

  

(i) During the past seven (7) years, neither Seller nor any ERISA
Affiliate (including either of the Companies or the Business) has contributed
to any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of section 3(37) of ERISA.

grant such waiver would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law);

_Access to Information_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) To the extent permitted by Law, between the date of this Agreement
and the Closing Date, Seller will, during ordinary business hours and upon
reasonable notice, (i) give Buyer and Buyers Representatives reasonable
access to the Purchased Assets and those of its properties, contracts and
records used principally in the Business or principally related to the
Purchased Assets, to which Seller has the right to grant access without the
consent of any other Person (and in the case where consent of another Person
is required, only on such terms and

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

46 

---|--- 
 

  

   

conditions as may be imposed by such other Person); (ii) permit Buyer to make
such reasonable inspections thereof (including but not limited to surveys
thereof) as Buyer may reasonably request; (iii) furnish Buyer with such
financial and operating data and other information with respect to the
Business as Buyer may from time to time reasonably request; (iv) grant Buyer
access to such officers and employees of Seller as Buyer may reasonably
request in connection with obtaining information regarding the Business or the

surveys, legal descriptions of real property and easements, contracts, leases
and other documents with respect to the Purchased Assets in Sellers
possession and reasonable control; (vi) furnish Buyer with a copy of each

Business filed by Seller, Limited Partner or the Companies with, or received
by Seller, Limited Partner or the Companies from, any Governmental Entity; and
(vii) furnish Buyer all information concerning the Business Employees or
Covered Individuals as reasonably requested; provided, however, that (A) any
such investigation will be conducted, and any such access to officers and
employees of Seller will be exercised, in such a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the operation of the Business or any other Person, (B) Buyer
will indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any Losses caused to
Seller by any action of Buyer or Buyers Representatives while present on any
of the Purchased Assets or other premises to which Buyer is granted access
hereunder (including restoring any of the Real Property to the condition
substantially equivalent to the condition such Real Property was in prior to
any investigation of environmental matters), (C) Seller will not be required
to take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege, and (D) Seller need not supply Buyer with any information which
Seller is under a contractual or other legal obligation not to supply;
provided, however, if Seller relies upon clauses (C) or (D) as a basis for
withholding information from disclosure to Buyer, to the fullest extent
possible without causing a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, or a
violation of a contractual or legal obligation, as the case may be, Seller
will provide Buyer with a description of the information withheld and the
basis for withholding such information. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 8.2 to the contrary, (x) Buyer will not have access to personnel and
medical records if such access could, in Sellers good faith judgment, subject
Seller to risk of liability or otherwise violate the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and (y) any investigation of
environmental matters by or on behalf of Buyer will be limited to visual
inspections and site visits commonly included in the scope of " _Phase 1_ "
level environmental inspections, and Buyer will not have the right to perform
or conduct any other sampling or testing at, in, on, or underneath any of the
Purchased Assets. Seller acknowledges and agrees that except for the
information disclosed in _Schedules 1.1-B_, _3.1(a)_ , _5.3(b)_ , _5.5(a)-1_
, _5.5(a)-2_ , _5.5(b)-1_ , _5.5(b)-2_ , _5.8_ , _5.10(b)_ , _5.10(c)_ ,
_5.11_ , _5.14_ , _8.8(d)(ii)(D)_ and _8.8(d)(ii)-A_ to this Agreement, Buyer
may include such information relating to the Business and the Purchased Assets
as reasonably necessary in filings with the SEC, including in one or more
registration statements filed by Buyer in connection with obtaining the Buyer
Financing.

  

(b) Unless and until the transactions contemplated hereby have been
consummated, Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates and Buyers
Representatives to, hold in strict confidence and not use or disclose to any
other Person all Confidential Information. " _Confidential Information_ "
means all information in any form heretofore or hereafter obtained from Seller
in connection with Buyers evaluation of the Business or the negotiation of
this Agreement, whether pertaining to financial condition, results of
operations, methods of operation

or otherwise, other than information which is in the public domain through no
violation of this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement by Buyer, its
Affiliates, or Buyers Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such information is
required to be disclosed by Buyer by Law or in connection with any proceeding
by or before a Governmental Entity, including any disclosure, financial or
otherwise, required to comply with any SEC rules. In the event that Buyer
believes any such disclosure is required, Buyer will give Seller notice
thereof as promptly as possible and will cooperate with Seller in seeking any
protective orders or other relief as Seller may determine to be necessary or
desirable. In no event will Buyer make or permit to be made any disclosure of
Confidential Information other than to the extent Buyers legal counsel has
advised in writing is required by Law, and Buyer will use its reasonable best
efforts to assure that any Confidential Information so disclosed is protected
from further disclosure to the maximum extent permitted by Law. If the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, Buyer will promptly upon
Sellers request, destroy or return to Seller all copies of any Confidential
Information, including any materials prepared by Buyer or Buyers
Representatives incorporating or reflecting Confidential Information, and an
officer of Buyer shall certify in writing compliance by Buyer with the
foregoing. Seller acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement (other than the
information disclosed in _Schedules 1.1-B_, _3.1(a)_ , _5.3(b)_ , _5.5(a)-1_
, _5.5(a)-2_ , _5.5(b)-1_ , _5.5(b)-2_ , _5.8_ , _5.10(b)_ , _5.10(c)_ ,
_5.11_ , _5.14_ , _8.8(d)(ii)(D)_ and _8.8(d)(ii)-A_ to this Agreement) shall
not be considered Confidential Information for purposes of this Section
8.2(b).

  

(c) Seller agrees that for the two-year period immediately following
the Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates and Sellers
Representatives to, hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any other
Person all Confidential Business Information. " _Confidential Business
Information_ " means all commercially sensitive information in any form
heretofore or hereafter obtained by Seller to the extent relating to the
Business or the Purchased Assets, whether pertaining to financial condition,
results of operations, methods of operation or otherwise, other than
information which is in the public domain through no violation of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may disclose Confidential
Business Information to the extent that such information is required to be
disclosed under contracts existing as of the Closing Date, by Law, or in
connection with any proceeding by or before a Governmental Entity, including
any disclosure, financial or otherwise, required to comply with any SEC rules
or Required Regulatory Approvals. In the event that Seller believes any such
disclosure is required by Law or in connection with any proceeding by or
before a Governmental Entity, Seller will give Buyer notice thereof as
promptly as possible and will cooperate with Buyer in seeking any protective
orders or other relief as Buyer may determine to be necessary or desirable. In
no event will Seller make or permit to be made any disclosure of Confidential
Business Information other than to the extent Seller determines in good faith
to be required pursuant to SEC rules, or rules governing required disclosure
in other regulatory proceedings, or its legal counsel has advised is required
to comply with the terms of a contract existing as of the Closing Date or
required by Law, or is required in connection with any proceeding by or before
a Governmental Entity, and Seller will use its reasonable best efforts to
assure that any Confidential Business Information so disclosed is protected
from further disclosure.

  

(d) The provisions of Section 8.2(b) supersede the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement relating to Proprietary Information (as defined
therein), and will survive for a period of two (2) years following the earlier
of the Closing or the termination of this

Agreement, except that if the Closing occurs, the provisions of Section 8.2(b)
will expire with respect to any information principally related to the
Purchased Assets and the Business.

  

(e) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, each Party
and its representatives will have reasonable access to all of the books and
records relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets, including all
Transferred Employee Records, in the possession of the other Parties or the
Companies to the extent that such access may reasonably be required by such
Party in connection with the Assumed Obligations or the Excluded Liabilities,
or other matters relating to or affected by the operation of the Business and
the Purchased Assets. Such access will be afforded by the Person in possession
of such books and records upon receipt of reasonable advance notice and during
normal business hours; provided, however, that (i) any review of books and
records will be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably
with the operation of the business of any Party or its Affiliates, (ii) no
Party will be required to, and Seller will not be required to cause the
Companies to, take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege, and (iii) no Party need supply any other Party with any
information which such Party is under a contractual or other legal obligation
not to supply. The Party exercising the right of access hereunder will be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this
Section 8.2(e) and will reimburse the other Party for any costs or expenses
incurred by such other Party in connection with complying with such request.
If the Party in possession of such books and records desires to dispose of any
such books and records prior to the expiration of such seven-year period, such
Party will, prior to such disposition, give the other Parties and the
Companies, as applicable, a reasonable opportunity at such other Partys
expense to segregate and take possession of such books and records as such
other Party may select.

  

8.3 _Expenses_. Except to the extent specifically provided herein,
in the Merger Agreement or in the Asset Purchase Agreement, and irrespective
of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby will be borne by the Party incurring such costs and
expenses.

transactions contemplated hereby, by the Merger Agreement and by the Asset
Purchase Agreement as promptly as practicable after the date of this

(d) To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer and Seller will have the

their respective Subsidiaries with, or any other written materials submitted
by any of them to, any third party or any Governmental Entity (other than the
SEC) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Merger and the Asset Purchase Agreement. To the extent permitted by Law, each
of Buyer and Seller will (i) provide the other with copies of all

reasonable best efforts to ensure that all telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will include representatives of Buyer and Seller; provided that nothing in the
foregoing will apply to or restrict communications or other actions by Seller
with or with regard to Governmental Entities in connection with the Purchased
Assets or the Business in the ordinary course of business. To the extent
permitted by Law, Buyer, Seller and Parent each agree to (1) provide one
another with copies of any registration statements filed with the SEC, in the
case of Buyer, in connection with obtaining financing, or by Seller and Parent
in connection with the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement,
(2) provide the other Parties the opportunity to review in advance and consult
with one another as to the content of such registration statements regarding
such Parties and, (3) provide the other Parties with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Subsidiaries (or its or their
respective Representatives) and the SEC with respect to such registration
statements regarding such Parties.

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 8.4(e) will require, or be construed to
require, (i) Seller to take or refrain from taking, or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking, any action or to engage in any
conduct, or to agree or consent to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries taking
any action or engaging in any conduct, or agreeing to any restriction,
condition or conduct, with respect to any of the businesses, assets or
operations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, if this action, restriction,
condition or conduct would take effect prior to the Closing or is not
conditioned on the Closing occurring, or (ii) Buyer to take or refrain from
taking, or to cause any of its Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking,
any action or to engage in any conduct, or to agree or consent to Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries taking any action, or agreeing to any restriction,
condition or conduct, with respect to any of the businesses, assets or
operations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, if the cumulative impact of
these actions, restrictions, conditions and conduct would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, assets, liabilities (contingent or otherwise) business or results
of operations of the Business and the Purchased Assets, together with the
Natural Gas Businesses and the Natural Gas Assets, taken as a whole (a "
_Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ "), it being understood that, for
purposes of determining whether a Regulatory Material Adverse Effect would
reasonably be expected to occur both the positive and negative effects of any
actions, conduct, restrictions and conditions, including any sale,
divestiture, licensing, lease, disposition or change or proposed change in
rates, will be taken into account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall
not take, consent to or agree to take any action with respect to the Business
or the Purchased Assets that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities
(contingent or otherwise), business or results of operations of the Post-Sale
Company (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and its Subsidiaries, without
Parents written consent.

  

(f) Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other and promptly
prepare and file notifications with, and request Tax clearances from, state

and local Tax Law.

  

(g) Each of Buyer, Seller and Parent will keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Merger

Agreement and the Asset Purchase Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing,
each of Buyer, Seller and Parent will promptly furnish the other with copies
of any notice or other communication received by it or its Subsidiaries from
any Person with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Merger Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement regarding (i) the
occurrence or existence of (A) the breach in any material respect of a
representation, warranty or covenant made by the other in this Agreement, or
(B) any fact, circumstance or event that has had, or individually or in the
aggregate would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (ii)
any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; and (iii) (A) the commencement or, to a
Partys knowledge, threatened commencement of any material Claims against
such Party, (B) the commencement of any material internal investigations or
the receipt of any material and reasonably credible whistleblower complaints
relating to a Party or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) the entry of any
material Order relating to a Party.

  

(h) Seller agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Seller or its Subsidiaries in writing specifically for Buyers use
in preparing, or incorporation by reference, in any registration statement to
be filed by Buyer in connection with obtaining Buyers financing will, at the
time such registration statement is filed with the SEC, is amended or
supplemented, or becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, not
misleading.

  

(i) Buyer agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Buyer or its Subsidiaries in writing specifically for Sellers and
Parents use in preparing, or incorporation by reference, in any registration
statement to be filed by Seller and Parent in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement will, at the time such registration
statement is filed with the SEC, is amended or supplemented, or becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, not misleading.

  

(j) Each of Seller, Parent and Buyer will, and will cause its
Subsidiaries, including in the case of Parent, Sellers successor, to
cooperate with the others and use reasonable best efforts to take or cause to
be taken all actions and do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper
or advisable on its part to enable Buyer, Parent, Seller and Sellers
successor to perform their respective obligations under the Transition
Services Agreement, including participation in the Transition Services
Committee to be established pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, and
implementation of the Transition Plan in accordance therewith.

_Procedures with Respect to Certain Agreements and Other Assets_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Seller has easements, real property license agreements (including
railroad crossing rights), rights-of-way, and leases for rights-of-way, which
relate solely to the Business and Purchased Assets (the " _Easements_ "). At
the Closing, Seller will convey and assign to the Companies, as applicable,
subject to the obtaining of any necessary consents, (i) by the

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

52 

---|--- 
 

  

   

Assignment of Easements, all Easements, and (ii) to the extent practicable, by
separate, recordable Assignment of Easement as to all Easements in each
separate County. Buyer and Seller agree that if Buyer and Seller determine any
of Sellers operations other than those of the Business "share" Easements with
Sellers Electric Business or Gas Business operations, Buyer and Seller will
take all actions reasonably necessary (such as executing sub-easements or
other documents) to ensure Buyer is permitted to use the same on a non-
exclusive basis, as presently used by Seller with respect to the Business.

  

(b) To the extent that any of the Purchased Assets or Sellers rights
under any Business Agreement may not be assigned to the Companies, as
applicable, without the consent of another Person which consent has not been
obtained, this Agreement will not constitute an agreement to assign the same
if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful.
Seller will use its reasonable best efforts (without being required to make
any payment to any third party or incur any economic burden, except as may be
specifically required under any Business Agreement in connection with the
grant of such consent) to obtain any such required consent as promptly as
possible. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller in its efforts to obtain any
such consent (including the submission of such financial or other information
concerning Buyer and the execution of any assumption agreements or similar
documents reasonably requested by a third party) without being required to
make any payment to any third party or to incur any economic burden (other
than the assumption of Sellers obligations under the applicable Business
Agreement). Seller and Buyer agree that if any consent to an assignment of a
Purchased Asset, including any Business Agreement is not obtained or if any
attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair the respective
Companys rights to such Purchased Assets or such rights and obligations under
the Business Agreement in question so that the applicable Company would not
acquire the benefit of all such rights and obligations, at the Closing the
Parties will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and such Business
Agreement, enter into such arrangements with each other as are reasonably
necessary to effect the transfer or assignment of such Purchased Asset or to
provide the Company with the benefits and obligations of such Business
Agreement from and after the Closing.

  

(c) To the extent that any Business Agreement consisting of a futures
contract, options contract, or other derivatives transaction (but not
including contracts for physical delivery) (each, a " _Financial Hedge_ ") is
not assignable due to the rules and regulations of the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission, the New York Mercantile Exchange or other futures or
options exchange on which the Financial Hedge was entered into, or the
relevant clearinghouse, Buyer and Seller agree that the Financial Hedge will
be liquidated at or promptly after the Closing. Liquidation proceeds will be
paid as follows: (i) in the event Sellers aggregate mark-to-market value of
the Financial Hedges is positive, Seller will pay Buyer the mark-to-market
value of the Financial Hedges; or (ii) in the event Sellers aggregate mark-
to-market value of the Financial Hedges is negative, Buyer will pay Seller the
mark-to-market value of the Financial Hedges. On or before the Closing, the
Parties will agree on a specific procedure to liquidate the non-assignable
Financial Hedges, and any payment due as a result of such liquidation under
this Section 8.5(c) will be made at or promptly after the Closing. Seller will
calculate the mark-to-market value of the Financial Hedges in accordance with
its usual and customary practice.

(d) Buyer and Parent agree that the agreements, if any, described on
_Schedule 8.5(d)_ (the " _Shared Agreements_ "), which will be attached to
this Agreement prior to July 1, 2007 by the mutual agreement of Buyer and
Parent, will be governed by this Section 8.5(d) and will not be Business
Agreements for purposes of this Agreement. Sellers rights and obligations
under the Shared Agreements, to the extent such rights and obligations relate
to the Business, are described on _Schedule 8.5(d)_, and are referred to
herein as the " _Allocated Rights and Obligations_." Unless Parent elects for
Seller or its successor to enter into Other Arrangements, Seller shall, or
Parent shall cause Sellers successor to, cooperate with Buyer and the
Companies and use their reasonable best efforts to enter into agreements
(effective from and after the Closing Date) with the other party or parties to
each Shared Agreement providing for (i) assignment to and assumption by the
Companies, effective from and after the Closing, of the Allocated Rights and
Obligations, and (ii) retention by Seller or its successor of all rights and
obligations of Seller under the Shared Agreements other than the Allocated
Rights and Obligations (such agreements set forth in (i) and (ii) being
referred to as " _Substitute Arrangements_ "); provided, that neither Seller
or its successor nor the Companies will be obligated to enter into or agree to
any such Substitute Arrangements unless such Substitute Arrangements have the
effect of transferring to the Companies the Allocated Rights and Obligations
(and reserving to Seller or its successor the rights and obligations which are
not Allocated Rights and Obligations) on a fair and equitable basis, as
determined in the reasonable discretion of Parent and Buyer. In connection
with the foregoing, Parent and Seller will, Parent will cause Sellers
successor to, and Buyer will cause the Companies to, as reasonably requested,
to submit such financial or other information concerning themselves or Seller,
and to execute such assumption agreements or similar documents reasonably
requested by a third party; provided that no Party will be, and Sellers
successor will not be, required to make any payment to any third party or to
incur any economic burden (other than the assumption of the Allocated Rights
and Obligations by the Companies, and the retention of the other rights and
obligations under the Shared Agreements by Seller, or its successor). In the
event that (x) Seller or its successor and the applicable Company are unable
to enter into Substitute Arrangements with respect to a Shared Agreement in
accordance with the foregoing, or (y) Seller notifies Buyer that it elects not
to pursue Substitute Arrangements with respect to such Shared Agreement, then
in either case at or promptly after the Closing such applicable Company and
Seller, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law and such Shared Agreement, will enter into such arrangements
with each other as are necessary to provide such Company with the benefits and
obligations of the Allocated Rights and Obligations under such Shared
Agreement, with Seller or its successor retaining the other benefits and
obligations under such Shared Agreements from and after the Closing (the "
_Other Arrangements_ ").

  

(e) Seller from time to time provides collateral or other security to
certain other Persons in connection with certain Business Agreements,
Financial Hedges and Shared Agreements. Seller and Buyer agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to cause such collateral or other security to be
returned to Seller (including in the case of a letter of credit a return of
the letter of credit to Seller), or released (in the case of other credit
support previously provided by Seller) at or promptly after the Closing. In
the event that such collateral or other security is not returned to Seller or
otherwise released at or promptly after the Closing, Buyer will (i) pay to
Seller, or its successor, an amount equal to any cash collateral posted by
Seller; and (ii) in the case of a letter of credit provided in connection
with a Business Agreement, replace such letter of credit as soon as
practicable, or if such letter of credit is provided in connection with a
Shared

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

54 

---|--- 
 

  

   

Agreement, provide to Seller, or its successor, a back-up letter of credit in
the same amount and for a period expiring no earlier than ten (10) days
following the expiration of the letter of credit previously provided by
Seller. The provisions of this Section 8.5(e) will apply to collateral or
other security provided in connection with Shared Agreements to the extent
such collateral or other security is related to the Allocated Rights and
Obligations under such Shared Agreements.

  

(f) In the event that any approval for the transfer of any of the
Purchased Assets to the Companies, is required from the Federal Communications
Commission or any Franchise authority, and such approval is necessary to
obtain in order to avoid violation of any Law, but is not a Required
Regulatory Approval, the Parties agree that if such approval is not obtained
prior to the Closing:

  

(i) they will each continue to use, and Parent and Seller will, and
Parent will cause Sellers successor to use, reasonable best efforts to
obtain, and with respect to Parent, to cause Sellers successor to obtain,
such approvals as promptly as possible;

  

(ii) any of the Purchased Assets, the transfer of which to the
Companies, in the absence of such an approval would cause or lead to a
violation of any Law (the " _Contingent Purchased Assets_ "), shall not be
transferred to the Companies at the Closing, but Seller will, or Parent will
cause Sellers successor to, transfer such assets immediately upon receipt of
the requisite approvals, with the time between the Closing and the receipt of
such approval being referred to as the " _Interim Period_ ";

  

(iii) during the Interim Period, Seller or its successor shall
continue to have all title, rights, and obligations in the Contingent
Purchased Assets to the extent necessary to avoid any violation of Law; and

  

(iv) Buyer will, and Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers
successor to, enter into such arrangements with each other prior to Closing as
are permissible under Law and reasonably necessary to provide Buyer with the
benefits and obligations in respect of the Contingent Purchased Assets from
and after the Closing, and otherwise on terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Seller or its successor.

  

(g) Following the Closing, Buyer will cause the Companies and Seller
will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, promptly remit to the other
any payments the Companies or Seller or its successor receives that are in
satisfaction of any rights or assets belonging to the other.

  

(h) With respect to the vehicles that are included in the Purchased
Assets and that are subject to the Master Lease Agreement described in
_Schedule 5.8_, Seller shall, upon written notice from Buyer, purchase such
vehicles prior to the Closing and obtain the release of the liens on such
vehicles as indicated in _Schedule 5.8_.

  

8.6 _Public Statements_. Each Party will consult with the other
prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public announcements
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except (i) as
may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or any self-

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

regulatory organization, and (ii) for any consultation that would not be
reasonably practicable as a result of requirements of Law.

  |  

_Tax Matters_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) All transfer, documentary, stamp, registration, sales and use
Taxes, including real property conveyance Taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ "),
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be shared equally between Seller or its successor, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. To the extent required by applicable Law,
Seller shall, or Parent shall cause Sellers successor to, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Transfer Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Buyer shall join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation. Buyer shall
remit to Seller, within 20 days after receipt of notice as to the amount of
such Transfer Taxes that are payable on or after the Closing or have been
paid, 50 percent of the total amount of such Transfer Taxes. In the event
there is an additional assessment of such Transfer Taxes or an amount of such
Transfer Taxes is refunded, (i) Buyer and Seller shall share equally the
amount of any such additional assessment, with the Party that is not required
to pay such Transfer Tax under applicable Law remitting to the other 50
percent of such additional assessment within 20 days after receiving notice of
a final determination, and (ii) Buyer and Seller shall share equally the
amount of any such refund, with the Party receiving such refund paying 50
percent of such refund to the other within 20 days after receiving such refund
(or claiming an offset against Taxes relating to such refund).

  

(b) Buyer will be responsible for the preparation and timely filing of,
and will cause the Companies to, to the extent applicable, prepare and timely
file, all Tax Returns associated with the Business, the Purchased Assets and
the Business Employees for (i) in the case of property Taxes and payroll
Taxes, all periods that begin before and end after the Closing Date (the "
_Straddle Period Taxes_ "), and (ii) in the case of all Taxes, all periods
that begin after the Closing Date, and for the timely payment of all Taxes
described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.7(b).

  

(c) Any Tax Return that reflects Transfer Taxes or that reflects Taxes
to be prorated in accordance with Section 3.4 will be subject to the approval
of the Party not preparing such return, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Each Party will make any such Tax Return
prepared by it available for the other Partys review and approval no later
than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return.

  

(d) Buyer, Parent and Seller will, Buyer will cause the Companies to,
and Parent will cause Sellers successor to, provide one another with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by such other Persons in connection
with the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any
Governmental Entity, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liability for Taxes, and each of Buyer, Parent and Seller will, Buyer will
cause the Companies to, and Parent will cause Sellers successor to, retain
and provide the other with any records or information which may be relevant to
such return, audit or examination or proceedings. Any information obtained
pursuant to this Section 8.7(d) or pursuant to any other Section hereof
providing for the sharing of information in connection with

  |  

_Employees and Employee Benefits_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) No later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer will give Qualifying Offers of employment to commence with the
applicable Company as of the Closing Date to each of the Business Employees,
including any such employees who are on a leave of absence under the Family
and Medical Leave Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment
Rights Act or other applicable Law, or authorized under Sellers established
leave policy, including short-term or long-term disability. For this purpose,
a " _Qualifying Offer_ " means employment at a level of base pay at least
equal to the Business Employees base pay in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date, and with a primary work location no more than fifty (50)
miles from the Business Employees primary work location immediately prior to
the Closing Date; provided, however, that with respect to any Business
Employee who is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or Successor
Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Qualifying Offer shall be on terms and
conditions set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreement, Successor
Collective Bargaining Agreement or, if applicable, a new collective bargaining
agreement negotiated by Buyer or the Companies covering such employee. Each
Business Employee who becomes employed by either of the Companies pursuant to
this Section 8.8(a) is referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_." Each
Transferred Employee who is covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or a
Successor Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be referred to herein as a "
_CB Transferred Employee_ ," and each Transferred Employee who is not covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement or a Successor Collective Bargaining
Agreement shall be referred to herein as a " _Non-CB Transferred Employee_."

  

(b) All offers of employment made by Buyer with respect to employment
by either of the Companies pursuant to Section 8.8(a) will be made in
accordance with all applicable Laws, will be conditioned only on the
occurrence of the Closing, and will remain open until the Closing Date. Any
such offer which is accepted before it expires will thereafter be irrevocable,
except for good cause. Following acceptance of such offers, Buyer will provide
written notice thereof to Seller and Seller will, or Parent will cause
Sellers successor to, provide Buyer and the Companies with access to the
Transferred Employee Records consistent with applicable Law. Buyer will, and
will cause the Companies to, be responsible for all liabilities and
obligations for and with respect to any Business Employees who do not become
Transferred Employees including (i) pursuant to Exhibit 8.8(d)(ii)(C), (ii)
due to retirement by such employee after the date hereof and prior to Closing,
(iii) severance benefits which become payable to such Business Employee upon
any termination of such Business Employees employment on or following the
Closing Date, and (iv) the benefits described in Section 8.8(d)(ii)(D), but
not including liabilities and obligations with respect to insured welfare
benefits provided to such Business Employee for periods prior to the Closing
Date. Without limiting the obligations of Buyer or the Companies hereunder,
the employment of each Business Employee who does not become a Transferred
Employee as of the Closing shall be terminated immediately following the
Closing by Seller or the applicable Affiliate of Seller.

  

(c) From and after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause the Companies to
recognize the union locals that are the counterparties to Seller under the
Collective Bargaining

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

Agreements or any Successor Collective Bargaining Agreements entered into in
compliance with Section 8.1(a) (the " _Locals_ ") as the exclusive bargaining
representatives of the bargaining units that include CB Transferred Employees.
No later than twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will
negotiate and reach agreement with each Local on the terms and conditions of a
new collective bargaining agreement **** to be effective from and after the
Closing Date with respect to the applicable bargaining unit represented by
such Local (each such agreement being referred to as a " _New CBA_ "). ****
Should Buyer fail to successfully negotiate a New CBA with a Local at least
twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then at the Closing,
Seller will cause the Companies to assume the existing Collective Bargaining
Agreement or, as applicable, Successor Collective Bargaining Agreement entered
into in compliance with Section 8.1(a), to the extent applicable to the
bargaining unit represented by such Local and to the extent consistent with
applicable Law; provided that the Companies shall not assume any of the
Benefit Plans (but may receive assets to be transferred from such plans
pursuant to _Exhibit 8.8(d)(ii)(C)_), and Buyer will, or will cause the
Companies to, instead provide benefits of the type and amount described in the
existing Collective Bargaining Agreements or Successor Collective Bargaining
Agreements entered into in compliance with Section 8.1(a), as applicable,
through Buyers or the Companys own benefit plans and arrangements. Buyer
agrees that (i) upon request by Seller, Buyer will notify Seller of the
status of negotiations with each Local, and (ii) no later than nineteen (19)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will notify Seller whether a
New CBA has been successfully negotiated with such Local.

  

(d) The following will be applicable with respect to the Transferred
Employees, Business Employees, Current Retirees, and Other Plan Participants
as appropriate. For all purposes of this Section 8.8, determinations as to
whether any individuals are "similarly situated" shall be made by Buyer in its
reasonable discretion.

  

(i) From and after the Closing, the Transferred Employees will
accrue no additional benefits under any Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit plan, policy, program, or arrangement of Seller, Parent or their
respective Affiliates.

  

(ii) As of the Closing, with respect to the CB Transferred Employees,
Buyer will, or will cause the Companies to, provide benefits of the type and
amount described in the relevant collective bargaining agreements through
Buyers or the Companies own benefit plans and arrangements. As of the
Closing and extending through December 31 of the calendar year following the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Buyer will cause the Non-CB
Transferred Employees to be covered by Buyer or Company benefit plans that
provide compensation and employee benefits (excluding (i) equity or equity
based compensation, and (ii) change in control, severance or retention
payments) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than provided to the
Non-CB Transferred Employees immediately before the Closing; provided, that
in determining the timing, amount and terms and conditions of equity
compensation and other incentive awards to be granted to Non-CB Transferred
Employees, Buyer will treat in a substantially similar manner Non-CB
Transferred Employees and similarly situated other employees of Buyer
(including by reason of job duties and years of service). The commitments
under this Section 8.8(d)(ii) require the following with respect to the Non-CB
Transferred Employees and, to the extent not addressed in the relevant
collective bargaining agreement, the CB Transferred Employees:

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

58 

---|--- 
 

  

   

(A) With respect to welfare benefit plans, Buyer agrees to waive or to
cause the waiver of all restrictions, limitations or exclusionary periods as
to pre-existing conditions, actively-at-work exclusions, waiting periods and
proof of insurability requirements (to the extent allowable under Buyers
welfare benefit plans and insurance policies) for the Transferred Employees to
the same extent waived or satisfied under the corresponding Benefit Plans.
With respect to the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, all
eligible expenses incurred by any such employees or any eligible dependent
thereof, including any alternate recipient pursuant to qualified medical child
support orders, in the portion of the calendar year preceding the Closing Date
that were qualified to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any
deductible, co-insurance or out-of-pocket limit under any Seller Benefit Plan
will be taken into account for purposes of satisfying any deductible, co-
insurance or out-of-pocket limit under similar plans of Buyer or the Companies
for such calendar year. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller will, or Parent will cause
Sellers successor to, provide Buyer and the Companies with all relevant
information necessary or reasonably requested by Buyer or the Companies for
purposes of administering this provision, consistent with applicable Law.

  

(B) With respect to service and seniority, Buyer and the Companies
will recognize the service and seniority of each of the Transferred Employees
recognized by Seller for all material purposes, including the determination of
eligibility and vesting, the extent of service or seniority-related welfare
benefits, and eligibility for and level of retiree health benefits, but in any
event not for purposes of determining the accrual of pension benefits and
levels of pension or other retirement income benefits.

  

(C) The Parties will comply with the provisions set forth on _Exhibit
8.8(d)(ii)(C)_.

  

(D) Buyer will or will cause the Companies to assume all liabilities,
obligations, and responsibilities with respect to providing post-retirement
health and life insurance benefits arising under or pursuant to existing plans
and agreements of Seller (" _Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits_ ") to (i) the
persons listed on _Schedule 8.8(d)(ii)(D)_ and any Business Employee who
retires between the date hereof and the Closing Date (such listed persons and
such Business Employees, the " _Current Retirees_ "), and their spouses and
eligible dependents, and (ii) the Business Employees (together with the
Current Retirees, the " _Covered Individuals_ ") and their spouses and
eligible dependents. From and after the Closing, Buyer will or will cause the
Companies to continue to provide to the Covered Individuals Post-Retirement
Welfare Benefits that, in material respects, are comparable to in the
aggregate those Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits provided to such Covered
Individuals immediately prior to the Closing Date, under cost-sharing
structures that either are at least as favorable as the cost-sharing
structures in effect for and available to the Covered Individuals immediately
prior to the Closing Date (as adjusted for inflation); provided that if Buyer
or any of the Companies reduces or eliminates any Post-Retirement Welfare
Benefits provided to Covered Individuals from such benefits that are available
to such individuals under the terms and conditions of the existing plans and
agreements of Seller applicable to such individuals as in effect on the date
hereof, any liabilities arising in connection with such reduction or
elimination shall be deemed an Assumed Obligation and Buyer will or will cause
the Companies to be responsible therefor.

---|--- 
 

  

   

(E) With respect to the Aquila, Inc. Retirement Investment Plan (the
" _Savings Plan_ "), Seller will vest Transferred Employees in their Savings
Plan account balances as of the Closing Date. Buyer will take all actions
necessary to establish or designate a defined contribution plan and trust
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code in
which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate (x) to recognize the
service that the Transferred Employees had in the Savings Plan for purposes of
determining such Transferred Employees eligibility to participate, vesting,
attainment of retirement dates, contribution levels, and, if applicable,
eligibility for optional forms of benefit payments, and (y) to accept direct
rollovers of Transferred Employees account balances in the Savings Plan,
including transfers of loan balances and related promissory notes, provided
that such loans would not be treated as taxable distributions at any time
prior to such transfer.

  

(F) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Seller will, or
Parent will cause Sellers successor to, transfer to a flexible spending plan
maintained by the applicable Company, the Companies or Buyer any balances
standing to the credit of Transferred Employees under Sellers flexible
spending plan as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, net of any
negative balances in the applicable accounts at such time. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers
successor to, provide to Buyer and the Companies a list of those Transferred
Employees that have participated in the health or dependent care reimbursement
accounts of Seller, together with (x) their elections made prior to the
Closing Date with respect to such account and (y) balances standing to their
credit as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date. As of the
transfer described in the first sentence hereof, the flexible spending plan
maintained by the Companies or Buyer shall assume the rights and obligations
of Sellers flexible spending plan with respect to the Transferred Employees
for the remainder of the year in which such transfer occurs. For the avoidance
of doubt, this paragraph shall not be construed to require a transfer with
respect to any Transferred Employee of an amount in excess of such employees
unreimbursed contributions to the flexible spending plan as of the date of
transfer.

  

(iii) With respect to severance benefits, Buyer will or will cause the
Companies to provide to any Non-CB Transferred Employee who is terminated by
Buyer or the Companies, as applicable (other than for cause), prior to the
date which is one (1) year following the Closing Date, severance benefits
comparable to those provided by Seller under Sellers severance plans and
policies (other than any plans or policies with respect to stock options or
other types of equity compensation) in effect immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Any employee who is provided severance benefits under this Section
8.8(d)(iii) may be required to execute a release of claims against Buyer,
Seller and their respective Affiliates and successors, in such form as Buyer
or the applicable Company, reasonably prescribes, as a condition for the
receipt of such benefits.

  

(iv) Parent will, or will cause Seller or its successor to, provide
COBRA Continuation Coverage to any current and former Business Employees, or
to any qualified beneficiaries of such Business Employees, who become or
became entitled to COBRA Continuation Coverage on or before the Closing,
including those for whom the Closing occurs during their COBRA election
period. Buyer will and will cause the Companies to be responsible for
extending and continuing to extend COBRA Continuation Coverage to all
Transferred

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

60 

---|--- 
 

  

   

Employees (and their qualified beneficiaries) who incur a COBRA qualifying
event and thus become entitled to such COBRA Continuation Coverage following
the Closing.

  

(v) Without limiting the obligations of the Parties under Sections
8.8(d)(ii)(C) and 8.8(d)(ii)(D), Seller or its Affiliates will pay or cause to
be paid to all Transferred Employees, all compensation (including any accrued
vacation carried over to the calendar year of the Closing from a previous
calendar year), workers compensation or other employment benefits to which
they are entitled or that have accrued under the terms of the applicable
compensation or Seller Benefit Plans or programs with respect to employment or
events occurring prior to the Closing Date; provided that if any of the CB
Transferred Employees elect to retain or carryover accrued and unused vacation
days rather than receive such payments, Seller or its Affiliates will pay or
cause to be paid to Buyer an amount equal to the aggregate amount that would
otherwise have been paid to such CB Transferred Employees with respect to such
vacation days, and Buyer will honor all such accrued and unused vacation days
of such CB Transferred Employees as of the Closing. Buyer will, or cause the
Companies to, pay to each Transferred Employee all unpaid salary or other
compensation or employment benefits (but not including any compensation
attributable to stock options or other types of equity compensation granted by
Seller) which accrue to such employee from and after the Closing Date, at such
times as provided under the terms of the applicable compensation or benefit
programs.

  

(vi) Without limiting the obligations of the Parties under Sections
8.8(d)(ii)(C) and 8.8(d)(ii)(D), Business Employees who on the Closing Date
are not actively at work due to a leave of absence covered by the Family and
Medical Leave Act, the Uniformed Service Employment and Reemployment Rights
Act or other applicable Law, or other authorized leave of absence under
Sellers established leave policy, including short-term or long-term
disability, will be provided by Buyer with, or Buyer will cause the Companies
to provide, benefits and compensation during such leave that is substantially
similar to the benefits and compensation provided to such employees by Seller
prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer will or will cause the Companies to treat
such Business Employees as Transferred Employees on the date that they are
able to return to work (provided that such return to work occurs within the
authorized period of their leaves following the Closing Date) and are able to
perform the essential functions of their jobs with or without reasonable
accommodation. Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of such individuals as
of the Closing Date with the scheduled dates for expiration of their leaves.

  

(vii) Buyer will or will cause the Companies to assume Sellers
obligations as of the Closing Date to pay nonqualified deferred compensation
to the applicable Business Employees and former Business Employees.

  

(e) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer a list of
the names and sites of employment of any and all Business Employees who have
experienced, or will experience, an employment loss or layoff as defined by
WARN Act or any similar applicable state or local Law requiring notice to
employees in the event of a closing or layoff within ninety (90) days prior to
the Closing Date. Seller shall update this list up to and including the
Closing Date. For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall not allow the Companies to engage in any conduct which would result in
an employment loss or layoff for a sufficient number of employees of the
Companies or either of them which, if aggregated with

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

61 

---|--- 
 

  

   

any such conduct on the part of Seller prior to the Closing Date, would
trigger the WARN Act or any similar applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, Buyer will be and will cause the Companies to be responsible, with
respect to the Business, for performing and discharging all requirements under
the WARN Act and under applicable state and local laws and regulations for the
notification to Transferred Employees of any "employment loss" within the
meaning of the WARN Act which occurs at or following the Closing Date.

  

(f) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to workers
compensation, Buyer shall or shall cause the Companies to assume, discharge,
pay and be solely liable for all Losses in respect of any Claims pending as of
or commenced after the Closing Date resulting from actual or alleged harm or
injury to any Business Employee regardless of when the incident or accident
giving rise to such liability occurred or occurs. Buyer shall or shall cause
the Companies to make all necessary arrangements to assume all such workers
compensation claim files, whether opened or closed, as of the Closing Date,
and will make the necessary arrangements for assuming the continued management
of such liabilities.

  

(g) From and after the Closing Date, except to the extent any such
Losses are covered under Sellers or an Affiliates third party insurance
plans or policies, reinsurance policies or arrangements, or trusts or other
funding vehicles, Buyer shall or shall cause the Companies to assume,
discharge, pay and be solely liable for health, accidental death and
dismemberment, short term disability or life insurance coverage and any
medical or dental benefits to the Business Employees and their eligible
dependents.

  

(h) Buyer agrees that from and after the Closing Date, if a Business
Employee commences an action, suit or proceeding relating to an employment-
related claim (but excluding, in any event the ERISA Case), any resulting
Liability shall be the responsibility of the Companies. Parent shall
reasonably cooperate with Buyer and the Companies in the defense of any such
claim to the extent that the applicable actions or events transpired preceding
the Closing Date.

  

(i) For purposes of Sections 8.8(f), 8.8(g) and 8.8(h), the term "
_Business Employees_ " shall also include any individuals who (A) were
employed principally for the Business at the time the incident or
circumstances giving rise to such suit, claim, action, proceeding or Loss
occurred, and (B) who are not employed by Seller either as of the date hereof
or as of the Closing Date.

  

(j) No provision in this Agreement shall modify or amend any other
agreement, plan, program or document, including any of Buyers benefit plans
or arrangements, unless this Agreement explicitly states that the provision
"amends" that other agreement, plan, program or document. This shall not
prevent the parties entitled to enforce this Agreement from enforcing any
provision in this Agreement, but no other party shall be entitled to enforce
any provision in this Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to
another agreement, plan, program or document, unless a provision is explicitly
designated as such in this Agreement, and the person is otherwise entitled to
enforce such other agreement, plan, program or document. If a party not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to
enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to another agreement,
plan, program or document, and such provision is construed to be such an
amendment despite not being explicitly designated

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

62 

---|--- 
 

  

   

as an amendment in this Agreement, such provision shall lapse retroactively,
thereby precluding it from having any amendatory effect. The provisions of
this Section 8.8 are not, and will not be construed as being, for the benefit
of any Person other than the Parties, and are not enforceable by any Persons
(including Transferred Employees, Current Retirees, and Other Plan
Participants) other than such Parties.

  

(k) Following the Closing, if Buyer, either of the Companies or Seller
or its successor identifies any individual that was incorrectly classified by
Seller (including employees not listed in _Schedule 1.1B_) with respect to
whether such individual was a Business Employee, a former employee of the
Business or a Current Retiree, as applicable, Buyer and Seller agree to, Buyer
shall cause the Companies to and Parent shall cause Sellers successor to,
notify the other Party or the Companies, as applicable, and, acting in good
faith, to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to cause such
individual to be appropriately classified for purposes of this Agreement, and
to allocate the liabilities and obligations related to such re-classified
individual in accordance with the terms hereof.

_Eminent Domain; Casualty Loss_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) If, before the Closing Date, any of the Purchased Assets are taken
by eminent domain or condemnation, or are the subject of a pending or (to
Sellers Knowledge) contemplated taking which has not been consummated, Seller
will (i) notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact, and (ii) at the
Closing assign, or Seller shall, or Parent shall cause Sellers successor to,
assign to the Companies all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to
any proceeds or payments received, or to be received, in compensation for such
taking.

  

(b) If, before the Closing Date, all or any material portion of the
Purchased Assets are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Seller
will notify Buyer promptly in writing of such fact and, at the Closing assign
to the Companies, or Seller shall, or Parent shall cause Sellers successor
to, assign to the Companies all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and
to any insurance recoveries received, or to be received, in compensation for
such damage or destruction less any such amounts received, or to be received,
to reimburse Seller for expenditures incurred by Seller to repair or replace
such Purchased Assets.

  

(c) Seller and Buyer will use their reasonable best efforts (without
being required to make payment to any third party or to incur any economic
burden) to obtain from each holder of any Preferential Purchase Right a
written waiver of such Preferential Purchase Right if required with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (an " _Applicable Preferential
Purchase Right_ "). If the Parties cannot obtain a waiver of an Applicable
Preferential Purchase Right, the Parties will cooperate, using reasonable best
efforts, to provide for compliance with the terms of such Applicable
Preferential Purchase Right. In the event that any Purchased Asset remains
subject to such Applicable Preferential Purchase Right as of the Closing, in
lieu of any adjustment to the Purchase Price Seller will, or Parent will
cause Sellers successor to, at the Closing assign to the applicable Company,
as a Purchased Asset, all of Sellers right, title, and interest in and to all
rights of Seller with respect to such Applicable Preferential Purchase Right,
including proceeds received or to be received in respect to such Applicable
Preferential Purchase Right, and will assign to the applicable Company and
Buyer

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

63 

---|--- 
 

  

   

shall cause such Company to assume, as Assumed Obligations, all obligations of
Seller with respect to such Applicable Preferential Purchase Right. If any
third party holding a Preferential Purchase Right exercises such right prior
to the Closing, Seller shall promptly give Buyer written notice of such
exercise. Buyer and Seller hereby expressly acknowledge and agree that nothing
in this Agreement constitutes an offer or agreement to sell, transfer, dispose
of, purchase, assume, or acquire any asset subject to a Preferential Purchase
Right except upon the Closing following the satisfaction of all conditions to
Closing specified in this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor anything
herein or in connection herewith shall be deemed to obligate Seller to sell,
transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of any Purchased Asset or Assumed
Obligation, to Buyer or any other Person, except upon the Closing following
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to Closing specified in this
Agreement.

  

(d) A condemnation or taking of, casualty or exercise of a Preferential
Purchase Right set forth in Schedule 5.8 with respect to, any Purchased Asset,
and any effects thereof (including any resulting termination of any Franchise
or other agreement principally related to such Purchased Asset), may be taken
into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred;
provided that to the extent either of the Companies is assigned the rights,
title and interest to any payments or proceeds received by Seller with respect
to any such condemnation or taking, casualty or exercise of a Preferential
Purchase Right, such payments or proceeds may be considered in determining
whether any Material Adverse Effect has occurred; provided further that
assignment of such proceeds or payments to such Company shall not necessarily
mean a Material Adverse Effect did not occur.

  

8.10 _Transitional Use of Signage and Other Materials Incorporating
Seller s Name or other Logos_. Parent acknowledges that it will have no
ongoing claim or rights in or to the Seller Marks. Within one hundred eighty
(180) days following the Closing Date, Parent will remove or cause the removal
of the Seller Marks from all signage or other items relating to or used in
connection with the Excluded Assets and, thereafter, Parent will not use or
permit the use of any Seller Marks.

  

8.11 _Litigation Support_. In the event and for so long as any of the
Companies, Buyer, Parent or Seller or its successor is actively contesting or
defending against any third-party Claim in connection with (i) any transaction
contemplated under this Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance,
status, condition, activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident,
action, failure to act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date
involving Seller, Buyer, Parent and Seller will, Seller will cause the
Companies to and Parent will cause Sellers successor to, cooperate with the
contesting or defending Person and its counsel in the contest or defense, make
reasonably available its personnel, and provide such testimony and access to
its books and records as is reasonably necessary in connection with the
contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or
defending Person.

_Audit Assistance_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) If, (i) during or for the period beginning on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date, Buyer is, in connection with any annual or
quarterly report filed with the SEC, required by the SEC to file audited or
reviewed financial statements of the Business in respect of any period
occurring prior the Closing Date, or (ii) during or for the period beginning
on the date

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

64 

---|--- 
 

  

   

hereof and ending on the last day of the calendar year of the Closing, Buyer
is, in connection with a registration statement or other voluntary filing to
be filed by Buyer with the SEC, required by the SEC to file audited or
reviewed financial statements of the Business in respect of any period
occurring prior the Closing Date, then in each case at Buyers request, as
applicable, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Sellers auditor to, at Buyers sole cost and
expense, (a) cooperate with and provide Buyer access to such information,
books and records as necessary for Buyer to prepare audited and interim or
reviewed financial statements of the Business, and (b) agree to provide to
Buyer an audit or review of the financial statements of the Business, for the
periods necessary to satisfy the SEC requirements (and any consents, if any,
to use such audited or reviewed financial statements in Buyers SEC filings).
Further, Seller will use reasonable best efforts to assist Buyer in preparing
pro forma financial information that in Buyers reasonable judgment may be
required to be included in any such filing or prospectus, offering memorandum
or other document or materials that may be prepared in connection with the
Buyer Financing or otherwise on or prior to the Closing, and, whether or not
Sellers auditor is retained by Buyer to conduct an audit or review of the
Business, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to (x) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause Sellers auditor to, at Buyers sole cost and
expense, make available to Buyer and its auditors the work papers and other
documents and records reasonably requested by Buyer that were created prior to
the Closing and relate principally to the Business, and (y) cooperate with
Buyer, at Buyers sole cost and expense, in obtaining an audit or review of
the Business, in each case, to the extent required by the SEC.

  

(b) Seller acknowledges and agrees that any audited and interim or
reviewed financial statements and related information prepared in accordance
with this Section 8.12 will not be deemed Confidential Information for
purposes of this Agreement.

  

8.13 _Notification of Customers_. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, cooperate
with the Companies and Buyer to cause to be sent to customers of the Business
a notice of the transfer of the customers from Seller to the applicable
Company (the " _Customer Notification_ "). The Customer Notification will
contain such information as is required by Law and approved by Buyer and
Seller, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

8.14 _Financing_. Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to take or to
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to close the Buyer Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Buyer Financing Commitments by the date upon which
the Closing Date is contemplated to occur in accordance with Section 4.1
(provided and to the extent that Buyer has not otherwise obtained funds
sufficient to pay the Purchase Price through other sources of funds and
provided that Buyer may replace or amend the Buyer Financing Commitments after
consultation with Parent and Seller but only if the terms of such replacement
or amended Buyer Financing Commitments, including with respect to
conditionality, would not adversely impact Buyers ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement,
or otherwise prevent, impact or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement), including
paying the commitment fees arising under the Buyer Financing Commitments as
and when such fees become due and payable during the period beginning on the
date hereof and ending on the Closing Date, and using reasonable best efforts
to (i) negotiate

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

65 

---|--- 
 

  

   

definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contained therein and (ii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to obtain the Buyer Financing. In the event any portion of the
Buyer Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated
in the Buyer Financing Commitments and Buyer has not otherwise obtained other
sources of funds, Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from alternative sources by the date upon which the Closing Date is
contemplated to occur in accordance with Section 4.1. Buyer will give prompt
notice to Seller and Parent of any material breach of the Buyer Financing
Commitments of which Buyer becomes aware or any termination of the Buyer
Financing Commitments or any Buyer Financing. Buyer will keep Seller and
Parent informed on a regularly current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of the Buyer Financing.

  

8.15 _Document Delivery_. The Parties will work cooperatively to make
available to Buyer prior to the Closing such Documents as are reasonably
necessary to transition the control and operation of the Business to the
Companies and Buyer at the Closing with minimal interruptions or disruptions
in the conduct of the Business. At or within a reasonably practicable period
of time after the Closing Date, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers
successor to, deliver to the Companies, at such location mutually agreed upon
by the Companies and Seller or its successor, any remaining Documents. At the
reasonable request of Buyer or the Companies, Seller will, or Parent will
cause Sellers successor to, use reasonable best efforts to make available in
an electronic format compatible with Buyers electronic systems any Documents
and other books and records relating to the Purchased Assets which are
maintained by Seller in electronic form.

  

8.16 _Surveys  Title Insurance, Estoppel Certificates, and Non-
Disturbance Agreements_. At Buyers option and at Buyers sole cost and
expense, Buyer may obtain (i) surveys desired by Buyer in respect of the Real
Property, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; (ii) title
insurance policies in current ALTA Form or equivalent covering the Real
Property, insuring title to the applicable Real Property as vested in the
Companies, and in form, substance, and amounts reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, with all
requirements satisfied or waived, with all exceptions deleted, and with all
endorsement thereto to the extent desired by Buyer; and (iii) all estoppel
certificates and non-disturbance agreements desired by Buyer in respect of
any real property leases included in the Purchased Assets, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and to the parties providing such
certificates and agreements. Seller and Limited Partner agree, and Parent
agrees to cause Sellers successor, to cooperate as reasonably requested by
Buyer (at Buyers expense) in its efforts to obtain such items, provided that
(y) none of Limited Partner, the Companies, Parent, Seller or Sellers
successor shall be required to make any payment to any third party or incur
any economic burden in connection therewith, and (z) Buyers obtaining any
such items shall not be a requirement of or a condition to the Closing. In
addition, with respect to Limited Partners, Sellers and Sellers successors
cooperation with Buyers reasonable requests to obtain title insurance under
clause (ii) above, none of Limited Partner, Seller and Sellers successor,
except to the extent required to satisfy the Closing condition set forth in
Section 9.2(f), and except for such actions as may be necessary to enable
Buyers title insurance company to insure title to the applicable Real
Property as vested in the Companies, shall be required to cure any purported
defects, cause any exceptions to be deleted, or provide any

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if any Non-
Permitted Encumbrances on the Company Interests, the Business or the Purchased
Assets are not released on or before the Closing, and such Non-Permitted
Encumbrances secure or are created by or in respect of the Excluded
Liabilities, or are for material delinquent Taxes or material delinquent
assessments, Seller shall, and Parent shall cause Sellers successor to,
promptly make such payments and take such actions as necessary to obtain the
release of such Non-Permitted Encumbrances after the Closing.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if Seller fails to
deliver any deeds of conveyance or assignments or other instruments,
certificates or documents as necessary to transfer any of the Purchased Assets

actions as necessary to transfer such Purchased Assets to the Companies as
soon as practicable after the Closing.

up, sublicensable, transferable license to use, reproduce, make derivative

the Excluded Assets. Except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement,
neither Buyer nor Parent shall have any obligation to support, maintain,

other in connection with, the Shared Code. The foregoing licenses shall be
binding on the respective successors and assigns of Buyer and Parent.

  

8.19 _Performance of the Obligations of the Companies Post-Closing_.
From and after the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Companies to perform all of
the obligations of the Companies that under the terms of this Agreement are to
be performed from and after the Closing Date.

(f) Buyer shall have received the items to be delivered pursuant to
Section 4.3; provided that the failure to deliver the items required to be

assignment, instrument of conveyance or certificate of title, termination or
release (i) otherwise required pursuant to Sections 4.3(e)-(h) relates to

TERMINATION AND OTHER REMEDIES

   

       



  |  

10.1

  |  

_Termination_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing
Date by mutual written consent of Seller, Buyer and Parent.

  

(b) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller or Buyer if the Closing
has not occurred on or before the first anniversary of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided that, if Buyer or Seller
determines that additional time is necessary to obtain any of the Required
Regulatory Approvals, the Material Company Regulatory Consents or the Material
Parent Regulatory Consents (each as defined in the Merger Agreement), or the
"Required Regulatory Approvals" as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement, or
if all of the conditions to Parents obligations to consummate the Merger
shall have been satisfied or shall be then capable of being satisfied and this
Agreement fails to be consummated by reason of a breach by Parent of its
obligation to be in a position to consummate the Merger after the Closing, the
Termination Date may be extended by Buyer or Seller from time to time by
written notice to the other Party and to Parent up to a date not beyond
eighteen (18) months after the date of this Agreement, any of which dates
shall thereafter be deemed to be the Termination Date; provided further that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) will not be
available to a Party that has breached in any material respect its obligations
under this Agreement in any manner that will have proximately contributed to
the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the Termination Date.

  

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by either Seller or Buyer if (i)
any Required Regulatory Approval has been denied by the applicable
Governmental Entity and all appeals of such denial have been taken and have
been unsuccessful, or (ii) one or more courts of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or any State has issued an Order permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order has become
final and nonappealable.

  

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if there has been a
material breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by Seller in
this Agreement, or any representation or warranty of Seller shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, so that Section 9.2(b) or 9.2(c)
would not be satisfied and this breach or failure to be true, is not curable,
or if curable, is not curable by the Termination Date (as the same may be
extended).

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

70 

---|--- 
 

  

   

(e) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if the Board of
Directors of Seller approves a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) and authorizes Seller to enter into a binding written agreement
with respect to that Superior Proposal and, in connection with the termination
of the Merger Agreement and entering into the agreement reflecting the
Superior Proposal, pays into a joint bank account in the names of Buyer and
Parent by wire transfer of same day funds the Company Termination Fee (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) required to be paid pursuant to Section
9.5(b) of the Merger Agreement.

  

(f) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if there has been a
material breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant made by Buyer in
this Agreement, or any representation or warranty of Buyer shall have become
untrue after the date of this Agreement, so that Sections 9.3(a) and 9.3(b)
would not be satisfied and this breach or failure to be true is not curable,
or if curable, is not curable by the Termination Date (as the same may be
extended).

  

(g) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer or Seller upon or
following the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

  

10.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, written notice thereof will
forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Parties and this
Agreement (other than as set forth in this Section 10.2, Section 10.4 and
Section 11.1) will terminate and become void and of no effect, and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be abandoned without further action by
any Party, whereupon the liabilities of the Parties hereunder (and of any of
their respective Representatives) will terminate, except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement; _provided_ , that such termination will
not relieve any Party from any liability for damages to any other Party
resulting from any prior breach of this Agreement, the Asset Purchase
Agreement or the Merger Agreement which is (i) material, and (ii) willful or
knowing. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(e) or
Section 10.1(g) upon or following termination of the Merger Agreement under
circumstances where Seller is required to pay Parent the Company Termination
Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) pursuant to the provisions of Section
9.5(b) of the Merger Agreement, Seller will, following such termination and at
the time required under Section 9.5(b) of the Merger Agreement, pay into a
joint bank account in the names of Buyer and Parent the termination fee
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, by wire
transfer of same day funds. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 10.1(g) upon or following termination of the Merger Agreement under
circumstances where Parent is required to pay Seller the Parent
Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) pursuant to the
provisions of Section 9.5(c) of the Merger Agreement, Parent will, following
such termination and at the time required for payment of the Parent
Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement), pay Buyer the
Termination Fee. Seller, Limited Partner and Parent acknowledge that the
agreements contained in this Section 10.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Buyer would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Seller
or Parent fails to pay promptly the amount due pursuant to this Section 10.2,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Buyer commences a suit which results in
a judgment against Seller or Parent, as the case may be, for the fee to be
paid by such Party as set forth in this Section 10.2, Seller or Parent, as
applicable, will pay to Buyer its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with this suit, together with interest

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

71 

---|--- 
 

  

   

on the amount of the fee at the Prime Rate in effect on the date the payment
should have been made.

  

10.3 _Payment of Termination Fee_. As promptly as practicable after
payment of the Company Termination Fee (as defined in the Merger Agreement) to
be paid pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement to the joint bank
account, Parent and Buyer will reasonably agree upon the amount of the
Termination Fee (subject to the limitations thereon as set forth in the
definition of Termination Fee set forth herein) to be paid to Buyer, and upon
such agreement Buyer and Parent shall jointly direct payment of the agreed-
upon Termination Fee to Buyer and disbursement of the remaining amount in such
joint account to Parent.

   

       



  |  

10.4

  |  

_Remedies upon Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein: 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) ARTICLE XI (other than Section 11.2, Section 11.3 and Section 11.5)
and the agreements of the Parties contained in Section 8.2(b), Section 8.2(d),
Section 8.3, Section 10.2, Section 10.3 and Section 10.4 will survive the
termination of this Agreement.

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in view of the
difficulty of determining the amount of damages which may result from a
termination of this Agreement and the failure of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under circumstances in which a
termination fee is payable as contemplated by Section 10.2, Buyer, Parent,
Merger Sub, Seller and Limited Partner have mutually agreed that the payment
of the termination fees as set forth in Section 10.2 will be made as
liquidated damages, and not as a penalty. In the event of any such
termination, the Parties have agreed that the payment of the applicable
termination fee as set forth in Section 10.2 will be the sole and exclusive
remedy for monetary damages of Buyer. ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT (i) THE EXTENT OF DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF
THIS TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
TO ASCERTAIN UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A TERMINATION FEE IS PAYABLE AS
CONTEMPLATED BY SECTION 10.2, (ii) THE AMOUNT OF THE TERMINATION FEE
CONTEMPLATED IN SECTIONS 10.2 AND 10.3 IS A FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF
SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND (iii) RECEIPT OF SUCH TERMINATION
FEE BY BUYER DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY. THE PARTIES HEREBY FOREVER WAIVE
AND AGREE TO FOREGO TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW ANY
AND ALL RIGHTS THEY HAVE OR IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE TO ASSERT ANY CLAIM
DISPUTING OR OTHERWISE OBJECTING TO ANY OR ALL OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF
THIS SECTION 10.4(b). Any payment under Section 10.2 will be made by wire
transfer of same day funds to a bank account in the United States of America
designated in writing by the Parties entitled to receive such payment not
later than three (3) Business Days following the date such Party delivers
notice of such account designation to the Party responsible to make such
payment.

  

(c) Upon any termination of this Agreement, all filings, applications
and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent
practicable, will be withdrawn from the Governmental Entity or other Person to
which they were made.

ARTICLE XI

  



  

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

  

11.1 _Survival_. None of the covenants or agreements of Seller, Buyer,
Parent or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing,
except for this ARTICLE XI and those covenants and agreements contained herein
that by their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Closing. Except as specified in the foregoing sentence, all other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement will
not survive the Closing of this Agreement.

  

11.2 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified, or supplemented only by a written agreement executed and delivered
by duly authorized officers of Seller, Parent and Buyer.

  

11.3 _Waiver of Compliance_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of a Party to comply with any obligation, covenant,
agreement, or condition herein may be waived by the Party entitled to the
benefits thereof only by a written instrument signed by the Party granting
such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict compliance with
such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition will not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

  

11.4 _Notices_. Notices, requests, instructions or other documents to
be given under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given, (a)
when sent if sent by facsimile, provided that the fax is promptly confirmed by
telephone confirmation thereof, (b) when delivered, if delivered personally to
the intended recipient, and (c) one (1) Business Day later, if sent by
overnight delivery via a national courier service, and in each case, addressed
to a Party at the following address for such Party:

11.5 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any Party,
without the prior written consent of the other Parties, nor is this Agreement
intended to confer upon any other Person except the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer, upon written notice
to but without the consent of Seller, Parent or Merger Sub, may assign this
Agreement or the rights, benefits and obligations described herein to one or
more wholly-owned Subsidiaries formed or to be formed to operate as a
regulated utility in Colorado; provided, however, that notwithstanding such
assignment, Buyer shall retain and remain responsible for all obligations and
liabilities of Buyer

requirements of the PUC.

  

11.6 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than Buyer, Seller, Limited
Partner, Parent and Merger Sub, any rights or remedies hereunder. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, no provision of this Agreement
creates any third party beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee
of Seller (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of
continued employment or resumed employment, and no provision of this Agreement
creates any rights in any employee or former employee of Seller (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of any benefits that may be
provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or
arrangement except as expressly provided for under such plans or
arrangements.

_GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS
SHALL BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW
OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE CONFLICTS OF RULES
THEREOF. The Parties hereby irrevocably submit exclusively to the jurisdiction
of the State of Delaware and agree not to assert, as a defense in any action,
suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof, that it is
not subject thereto or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such courts,
and each of Seller, Buyer, Parent and Merger Sub irrevocably agrees that all
claims with respect to such action or proceeding will be heard and determined
in Delaware state court. Each of Seller, Buyer, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over the Person of such
Parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of
process or other papers in connection with any such action or proceeding in
the manner provided in Section 11.4 or in such other manner as may be
permitted by Law, will be valid and sufficient service thereof.

  

(b) EACH OF SELLER, LIMITED PARTNER, BUYER, PARENT AND MERGER SUB
ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE
EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THE
PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH OF SELLER, LIMITED PARTNER, BUYER, PARENT
AND MERGER SUB CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE

AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 11.7(b).

  

11.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction will not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

  

11.9 _Specific Performance_. Each of Seller, Limited Partner, Buyer,
Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees that any breach of this
Agreement would give rise to irreparable harm for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy. Each of Seller, Limited Partner, Buyer, Parent and
Merger Sub accordingly agrees that, in addition to other remedies, the Parties
will be entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by decree of specific
performance without the necessity of providing the inadequacy of monetary
damages as a remedy and to obtain injunctive relief or other equitable remedy
against any breach or threatened breach hereof.

  

11.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement will be a valid and binding
agreement of the Parties only if and when it is fully executed and delivered
by the Parties, and until such execution and delivery no legal obligation will
be created by virtue hereof. This Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and
the Merger Agreement (in each case, together with the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto or thereto, and the certificates and instruments delivered pursuant
hereto or thereto), the Confidentiality Agreement, the confidentiality
agreement dated June 28, 2006 between Seller and Parent, as amended by the
letter agreement dated September 5, 2006 between Seller and Parent, the letter
of intent dated November 21, 2006 between Buyer and Parent, and the Transition
Services Agreement (together with the schedules thereto), embody the entire
agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement and
the Merger Agreement, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties, both written and oral, between or among the
Parties or any of them with respect to the transactions contemplated herein,
in the Partnership Interests Purchase Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

  

11.11 _Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws_. Buyer and Parent acknowledge that
Seller will not comply with the provisions of any bulk sales or transfer laws
of any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of the
bulk sales or transfer laws of all applicable jurisdictions

  

11.12 _No Consequential Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law,
no Party will, in any event, be liable to any other Party, either in contract,
in tort or otherwise, for any consequential, incidental, indirect, special, or
punitive damages of such other Party or Persons represented by such other
Party, whether or not the possibility of such damages has been disclosed to
such other Party or Persons represented by such other Party in advance or
could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party or Persons represented
by such other Party. The preceding sentence shall not limit the right of any
Party to seek "benefit of the bargain" damages for a breach of this Agreement
or specific performance or other equitable remedy as provided in Section
11.9; provided that the right of any Party or Persons represented by such
Party to seek any of such remedies is not an admission by the other Parties
that, under the circumstances, any such

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |  

76 

---|--- 
 

  

   

remedies are proper remedies; provided, further, that the Party against whom
any such remedy is sought may not claim that the awarding of "benefit of the
bargain" damages is prohibited by virtue of the restriction against liability
for consequential, incidental, indirect, special or punitive damages contained
in this Section 11.12.

  

11.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement, and any certificates and
instruments delivered under or in accordance herewith, may be executed in any
number of counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic
transmission), each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts will together constitute the same
instrument, it being understood that all of the Parties need not sign the same
counterpart.

The following terms will govern the Parties obligations under Section
8.8(d)(ii)(C) of the Agreement (and any reference to Section 8.8 will be
deemed to include a reference to this Exhibit):

   

       

A.

  |  

_Post-Closing Spin-Off to Buyer Plan_. 

---|--- 
 

    

       

(1)

  |  

_Transfer of Liabilities_. 

---|--- 
 

  

(a) As of the Closing Date, Buyer will cause a Buyer Pension Plan to
accept the liabilities for benefits under the Seller Pension Plan that would
have been paid or payable (but for the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to this Paragraph A) to or with respect to the Transferred Employees
and Other Plan Participants (as defined below), and Buyer will become, with
respect to each Transferred Employee and Other Plan Participant, responsible
for all benefits due under the Seller Pension Plan. Buyer is assuming only the
obligation to provide benefits in the amount determined in accordance with the
terms of the Seller Pension Plan, and Buyer is not assuming any other
liability or obligation that Seller or an ERISA Affiliate of Seller might have
or incur with respect to the Seller Pension Plan, including liability (if
any) for breaches of fiduciary duty or other penalty or excise Tax amounts.
Seller will not, and Parent will not permit Sellers successor to, take any
action to fully vest the Business Employees in their accrued benefits under
the Seller Pension Plan; provided that any vesting of Business Employees in
such accrued benefits in the ordinary course in accordance with the Seller
Pension Plan as in effect on the date hereof shall not be deemed a violation
of this Paragraph A(1). Buyer will not amend the Buyer Pension Plan, or permit
the Buyer Pension Plan to be amended, to eliminate any benefit accrued as of
the Closing Date, whether or not vested, with respect to which liabilities are
transferred pursuant to this Paragraph A; provided that Buyer may amend the
Buyer Pension Plan or permit the Buyer Pension Plan to be amended to eliminate
an optional form of distribution to the extent that such action is consistent
with applicable Law, including the regulations under section 411(d)(6) of the
Code **.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller will,
or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, cause the Seller Pension Plan to
continue to make all benefit payments to Transferred Employees and Other Plan
Participants due under the Seller Pension Plan until both the Initial Transfer
Amount and the True-Up Amount have been transferred to the Buyer Pension Plan,
following which transfer the Buyer Pension Plan shall make all benefit
payments to or in respect of Transferred Employees and Other Plan
Participants. " _Other Plan Participants_ " means any individuals (x) who have
an accrued benefit under the Seller Pension Plan but who are not actively
employed by Seller on the Closing Date, or whose employment is terminated by
Seller on the Closing Date, and (y) whose employment was principally
associated with the Business, all of whom are listed on _Schedule
8.8(d)(ii)-A_ , or will be listed on such Schedule as the same is amended by
Seller, with Buyers and Parents consent, on the Closing Date.

  

(b) As soon as practicable but in any event within thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor
to, deliver to Buyer a list reflecting each Transferred Employees service and
compensation under the Seller Pension Plan, each Transferred Employees and
Other Plan Participants accrued benefit thereunder as of the

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |

---|--- 
 

  

   

Closing Date, a copy of each pending or final domestic relations order
affecting the benefit of any Transferred Employee or Other Plan Participant,
and such other information as may be reasonably requested by Buyer consistent
with applicable Law to facilitate or assist with such transition or the
establishment of necessary records.

   

       

(2)

  |  

_Transfer of Assets_. 

---|--- 
 

  

(a) Not later than ten (10) days after the Closing, Seller will, or
Parent will cause Sellers successor to, direct its actuary to determine the
amount of assets allocable to the benefits with respect to the Transferred
Employees and Other Plan Participants in the Seller Pension Plan based on
section 4044 of ERISA and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation regulations
promulgated thereunder, and in compliance with section 414(l) of the Code
using the safe harbor assumptions thereunder (the " _Section 4044 Amount_ "),
measured as of the Closing Date. The actuarial assumptions used in the Section
4044 Amount determination shall be limited to the safe harbor assumptions
specified under Section 4.14(l) of the Code. Seller will, or Parent will
cause Sellers successor to, provide the information used to compute the
Section 4044 Amount for review by Buyers actuary before such amount is
transferred.

  

(b) In accordance with the procedures set forth in this Paragraph
A(2)(b), Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, cause cash
(or other assets as Seller or its successor and Buyer mutually agree) equal to
the Section 4044 Amount to be transferred to the trust established by Buyer as
part of the Buyer Pension Plan (the " _Buyer Pension Plan Trust_ "). On the
Initial Transfer Date, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor
to, cause the trust which is a part of the Seller Pension Plan (the " _Seller
Pension Plan Trust_ ") to make a transfer of cash or other assets as Seller or
its successor and Buyer mutually agree equal to the Initial Transfer
Amount to the Buyer Pension Plan Trust. The " _Initial Transfer Date_ " is
the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after the requirements of
Paragraphs A(2)(d) and A(2)(e) have been met. The " _Initial Transfer Amount_
" means 75% of Sellers or its successors good faith estimate of the Section
4044 Amount. As soon as practicable after the Section 4044 Amount is
determined in accordance with the requirements of Paragraph A(2)(a), and in no
event more than sixty (60) days after such final determination, the True-Up
Amount shall be transferred as provided below (the " _True-Up Date_ "). If the
Section 4044 Amount adjusted for earnings and losses of the assets of the
Seller Pension Plan from the Closing Date through the True-Up Date (the "
_Increased Section 4044 Amount_ "), is greater than the Reduction Amount
adjusted for earnings and losses of the assets of the Seller Pension Plan from
the Closing Date through the True-Up Date (the " _Increased Reduction Amount_
"), then Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, cause a
transfer in cash or other assets as Seller or its successor and Buyer mutually
agree equal to the True-Up Amount to be made from the Seller Pension Plan
Trust to the Buyer Pension Plan Trust. If the Increased Reduction Amount is
greater than the Increased Section 4044 Amount, then Buyer will cause a
transfer in cash or other assets as Seller or its successor and Buyer mutually
agree equal to the True-Up Amount to be made from the Buyer Pension Plan Trust
to the Seller Pension Plan Trust. The " _True-Up Amount_ ," if any, means the
difference between the Increased Section 4044 Amount and the Increased
Reduction Amount. The " _Reduction Amount_ " equals the sum of (x) the Initial
Transfer Amount, plus (y) benefit payments made to any Transferred Employees
and Other Plan Participants by the Seller Pension Plan after the Closing Date.
For purposes of these calculations, the earnings and losses of the assets of
the Seller Pension Plan from the Closing Date through the True-Up Date shall
be the net investment

  



     

       

1-LA/917645.9

  |

returns reasonably calculated by the trustee of the Seller Pension Plan for
each month between the Closing Date and the True-Up Date. Seller will, or
Parent will cause Sellers successor to, provide the information used to make
such calculations and compute the True-Up Amount for review by Buyers actuary
before any such amounts are transferred.

  

(c) To the extent that under Section 8.8 Buyer has agreed to accept a
liability of Seller under any of Sellers Benefit Plans (other than the Seller
Pension Plan) with respect to employees of Seller that are Business Employees,
Transferred Employees, Current Retirees or Covered Individuals, and such
Benefit Plans, including any non-qualified deferred compensation plan or
agreement, is funded through or maintained in connection with a grantor trust,
secular trust, Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association or other trusts or
arrangements used to provide benefits payable under any such plan or
agreement, as promptly as practicable after the Closing, Buyer and Seller
will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor to, determine the amount of
assets in such trusts or other arrangements historically allocated to the
Business, the Business Employees, Transferred Employees, or other Covered
Individuals with respect to liabilities assumed by Buyer, and such assets
shall be transferred, to the extent consistent with the terms of any such
trust as in effect on the date hereof and not contrary to applicable Law, to a
similar trust or arrangement established and maintained by Buyer to fund such
benefits. Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to make or cause to be made
any required amendments to such trusts and agreements to provide for the
transfers described in this Paragraph A(2)(c).

  

(d) In connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to this Section, Seller will, or Parent will cause Sellers successor
to, provide to Buyer, and Buyer will provide to Seller or its successor,
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the other Party that the other Partys
Pension Plan is or continues to be qualified under section 401(a) of the Code
and is in compliance with the funding requirements of section 302 of ERISA and
section 412 of the Code.

  

(e) In connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities
pursuant to Paragraph A, the Companies, Buyer and Seller will, or Parent will
cause Sellers successor to, cooperate with each other in making all
appropriate filings required by the Code or ERISA in a timely manner, but not
later than within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, and the transfer of
assets and liabilities from the Seller Pension Plan pursuant to this Exhibit
8.8(d)(ii)(C) will not take place until after the expiration of the thirty
(30) day period following the filing of any required notices with the Internal
Revenue Service pursuant to section 6058(b) of the Code.

  

(3) _Benefits_. The benefit provided by the Buyer Pension Plan to
each Transferred Employee and Other Plan Participant who becomes a participant
in the Buyer Pension Plan will be at least equal to the benefits accrued by
such Transferred Employee or Other Plan Participant under the Seller Pension
Plan on the Closing Date, computed by taking into account the service credited
to such Transferred Employee and Other Plan Participant with Seller and Buyer
(in the case of service of Transferred Employees with Buyer, such service will
be required to be taken into account only for the purpose of vesting and early
retirement subsidies or as otherwise required by applicable Law).

_Further Purchase Price Adjustment_. 

---|--- 
 

  

(1) _Adjusted Section 4044 Amount_. Seller will, or Parent will
cause Sellers successor to, also calculate the Section 4044 Amount using the
same assumptions and methodologies as used to calculate the Section 4044
Amount pursuant to Paragraph A(2)(a), but adjusted to remove from the assets
of the Seller Pension Plan an amount equal to Sellers contributions to the
Seller Pension Plan made between the date hereof and the Closing Date (the
Section 4044 Amount so adjusted, the " _Adjusted Section 4044 Amount_ ").
Seller shall, or Parent shall cause Sellers successor to, provide the
information used to compute the Adjusted Section 4044 Amount for review by
Buyers actuary. Buyer and Seller, or Parent will cause Sellers successor
to, cooperate in good faith and resolve and reconcile any differences or
disputes with respect to the calculation of the Adjusted Section 4044 Amount
as soon as practicable.

  

(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchase
Price (i) shall be decreased by the amount, if any, by which the Adjusted
Section 4044 Amount exceeds the Section 4044 Amount, and (ii) shall be
increased by the amount, if any, by which the Adjusted Section 4044 Amount is
less than the Section 4044 Amount. On the earlier of the date that the True-Up
Amount is transferred, or within five (5) Business Days of the date the True-
Up Amount is determined, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the
increase in the Purchase Price, if any, determined pursuant to this Paragraph
B, to Seller or its successor, or Seller shall, or Parent shall cause Sellers
successor to, pay an amount equal to the amount of the decrease, if any, in
the Purchase Price determined pursuant to this Paragraph B, as applicable, by
wire transfer of same day funds.
