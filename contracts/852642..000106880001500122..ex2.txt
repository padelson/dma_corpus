                                  ARTICLE I
                                  ---------
                                 THE MERGER
                                 ----------

         1.01     The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
                  ----------
Agreement, Allegiant shall be merged with and into Southside in accordance
with Chapter 351 of the Missouri Revised Statutes (the "Missouri Statute"),
and the separate corporate existence of Allegiant shall cease. Southside
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be
governed by the laws of the State of Missouri.

         1.02     Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger, unless
                  -------
the parties hereto shall otherwise mutually agree, shall take place at the
offices of Thompson Coburn LLP in St. Louis, Missouri, at 10:00 a.m., local
time, on the date that the Effective Time occurs (the "Closing Date").

         1.03     Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective (the
                  --------------
"Effective Time") upon the filing of Articles of Merger with the Office of
the Secretary of State of the State of Missouri. Unless otherwise mutually
agreed in writing by Allegiant and Southside, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Effective Time shall occur on such date as
Allegiant shall notify Southside in writing (such notice to be at least five
(5) business days in advance of the Effective Time) but (A) not earlier than
the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in Article VI (the
"Approval Date") and (B) not later than the last business day of the
calendar month during which the Approval Date occurs; provided, however,
that Allegiant may postpone the Effective Time to the earliest time which
will result in shareholders of Southside receiving a quarterly dividend only
from Southside or only from Surviving Corporation (in the case of those
shareholders of Southside who receive Surviving Corporation Common Stock in
the Merger), but not from both, for the calendar quarter in which the
Effective Time occurs. On the Closing Date, Southside and Allegiant will
cause the Merger to be consummated by delivering to the Secretary of State
of the State of Missouri, for filing, Articles of Merger, in such form as
required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the Missouri Statute.

         1.04     Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective
                  ------------------
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any
further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are
necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Allegiant, or (b)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Allegiant shall be
deemed to have granted to the Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of
attorney to execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in
law and to do all acts necessary or proper to vest, perfect or confirm title
to and possession of such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and
the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in
the name of Allegiant or otherwise to take any and all such action.

         1.05     Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. Subject to the
                  -------------------------------------
terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Articles of Incorporation and
By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall be in



                                    - 2 -

<PAGE>

the form to be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof and in any event prior to the mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus; provided, that such Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws shall be substantially identical to the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of Allegiant, with such changes as approved by
Allegiant; provided, further, that the Articles of Incorporation shall
provide that the number of authorized shares of common stock shall be
30,000,000, par value $0.01 per share.

         1.06     Board of Directors and Officers; Executive Offices. At the
                  --------------------------------------------------
Effective Time, the directors and officers of Allegiant immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation following the Merger, and such directors and officers
shall hold office in accordance with Surviving Corporation's By-Laws and
applicable law. Effective as of the Effective Time, the two persons (a) who
are directors of Southside as of the date hereof, (b) who, immediately after
the Effective Time, hold the greatest number of shares of Surviving
Corporation Common Stock among all of the directors of Southside (which, for
this purpose, shall include shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of the Southside Employee Stock Options
immediately after the Effective Time) and (c) who are approved by Allegiant,
such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, shall be elected to serve on
Surviving Corporation's Board of Directors for terms expiring at Surviving
Corporation's annual meetings in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Southside may
replace either or both of the nominees prior to the Effective Date, subject
to Allegiant's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. Immediately after
the Effective Time, the locations of the headquarters and principal
executive offices of the Surviving Corporation shall be those of Allegiant
prior to the Effective Time.

         1.07     Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue
                  ------------------------

         Southside and Allegiant of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
         including the prospectus contained in the Registration Statement on
         Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Southside for the purpose of
         registering the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be
         exchanged for Southside and Allegiant Common Stock pursuant to the
         provisions of this Agreement (the "Registration Statement"),
         Allegiant shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of
         record of Southside Common Stock a form of election (an "Election
         Form") on which such holder shall make the election as provided for
         in Section 1.08(b) of this Agreement. Allegiant also shall cause an
         Election Form and other appropriate materials for the purpose of
         making the election provided for in Section 1.08(b) of this
         Agreement to be sent to each holder of Southside Common Stock who
         Southside advises Allegiant (pursuant to Section 1.12(b)) has
         become a holder of Southside Common Stock after the record date of
         the special meeting of shareholders of Southside called pursuant to
         Section 5.03(a). "Exchange Agent" shall mean UMB Bank, N.A. or such
         other bank or trust company or affiliate thereof selected by
         Allegiant and reasonably acceptable to Southside to effect the
         exchange of certificates formerly representing shares of Southside
         Common Stock (the "Certificates") for the Southside Merger
         Consideration.

                  (b) Each Election Form shall specify the amount of each

         either the Cash Distribution, the Stock Distribution or the Combined
         Distribution and shall permit each such holder to propose to
         receive, as provided in Section 1.07 of this Agreement, (i) the Cash
         Distribution (in which case, such holder's shares of Southside
         Common Stock shall be deemed to be and shall be referred to herein
         as "Cash Election Shares"), (ii) the Stock Distribution (in which
         case, such holder's shares of Southside Common Stock shall be deemed
         to be and shall be referred to herein as "Stock Election Shares"),
         or (iii) the Combined Distribution (in which case, such holder's
         shares of Southside Common Stock shall be deemed to be and shall be
         referred to herein as "Combined Election Shares"). If a holder
         chooses a Combined Distribution, then the holder shall specify on
         the Election Form the percentage of the Combined Distribution
         requested to be received as a Cash Distribution and the percentage
         of the Combined Distribution to be received as a Stock Distribution.

                  (c) Any shares of Southside Common Stock with respect to
         which the holder thereof shall not, as of the Election Deadline,
         have made an election to receive either the Cash Distribution, the
         Stock Distribution or the Combined Distribution (such holder's
         shares being deemed to be and shall be referred to herein as "No
         Election Shares") by submitting to the Exchange Agent an effective,
         properly completed Election Form, shall be deemed to be Stock
         Election Shares, except as set forth in Section 1.08(f) of this
         Agreement. "Election Deadline" shall mean 5:00 P.M., local time, on
         the date of the special meeting of shareholders of Southside called
         to vote upon this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions
         contemplated thereby.

                  (d) For purposes of Section 1.08(f) of this Agreement, (i)
         any Southside Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to be Cash Election
         Shares; provided, however, that such Southside Dissenting Shares
         shall in all cases be payable in cash and shall not be subject to
         pro rata reduction, if required, of the Cash Distribution payable
         in conversion of the other Cash Election Shares as set forth in
         Section 1.08(f) of this Agreement, and (ii) Southside Common Stock
         that is issuable upon the exercise of any stock options granted by
         Southside (the "Southside Employee Stock Options") that are
         unexercised as of the Effective Time shall not be converted into
         cash or Surviving Corporation Common Stock in connection with the
         Merger, but shall instead be converted into stock options to
         acquire shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock as described
         in Section 5.14 hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
         this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the exercise of
         Southside Employee Stock Options prior to the Effective Time in
         accordance with their terms (in which case the shares of Southside
         Common Stock issued upon such exercise shall be converted into cash
         or Surviving Corporation Common Stock as provided herein).

                  (e) Any election for purposes of Section 1.08(b) of this
         Agreement shall be effective only if the Exchange Agent shall have
         received the properly completed Election Form by the Election
         Deadline. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by the person
         submitting such Election Form or any other person to whom the
         shares that are the subject of an Election Form are subsequently
         transferred. Such revocation or change shall be effected by written
         notice by such person to the Exchange Agent; provided such notice
         is received by the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Election
         Deadline. All

         Election Forms shall be deemed to be revoked if the Exchange Agent
         is notified in writing by either Allegiant or Southside that this
         Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms. The
         Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine when
         any election, modification or revocation is received or whether any
         such election, modification or revocation is effective, consistent
         with the duty of the Exchange Agent to give effect to such
         elections, modifications or revocations to the maximum extent
         possible.

                  (f) As soon as practicable after the Election Deadline,
         Allegiant, after consulting with Southside, shall cause the
         Exchange Agent to allocate among the holders of Southside Common
         Stock the rights to receive the Cash Distribution, the Stock
         Distribution and/or the Combined Distribution, pursuant to the
         Merger after the Effective Time, under the circumstances set forth
         below (provided, if there is no reallocation of any form of
         Southside Merger Consideration resulting from the following, then
         the holder shall receive that form of Southside Merger
         Consideration designated in such holder's Election Form):

                           (i) If the number of shares of Surviving
                  Corporation Common Stock issuable in respect of the Stock
                  Election Shares and the Stock Distribution portion of the
                  Combined Election Shares is less than the Stock Conversion
                  Number, then:

                                    (A) First, all of the Stock Election
                           Shares (including No Election Shares) and the
                           portion of the Stock Distribution specified or
                           deemed specified on the Election Forms by holders
                           of Combination Election Shares shall be converted
                           into the right to receive the number of shares of
                           Surviving Corporation Common Stock elected
                           pursuant to the applicable Election Forms; and

                                    (B) Second, the Exchange Agent shall
                           reallocate the portion of the Cash Distribution
                           specified or deemed specified in the Election
                           Forms by holders of Combined Election Shares such
                           that all of the holders of Combined Election
                           Shares will receive in the aggregate the lesser
                           of (a) the total number of shares of Surviving
                           Corporation Common Stock into which all Combined
                           Election Shares are convertible, and (b) the
                           number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
                           Stock which will equal the number of shares by
                           which the Stock Election Shares and Combined
                           Election Shares are less than the Stock
                           Conversion Number, to be allocated among each
                           holder based upon the total amount of Cash
                           Distribution requested to be received by such
                           holder of Combined Election Shares as compared
                           with the total amount of Cash Distribution
                           requested to be received by all such holders.
                           Such holders shall receive the balance of the
                           Southside Merger Consideration, if any, to which
                           each such holder is entitled to receive pursuant
                           to the Merger in cash (determined by (x) dividing
                           the total Stock Distribution to be received by
                           such holder after giving effect to the
                           reallocation described in this Section 1.08(f) by
                           1.39, (y) subtracting the result in (x) from the
                           number of shares of Southside

                           Time, and (z) multiplying the difference
                           determined in (y) by $14.00 per share); and

                                    (C) Third, if any portion of the Stock
                           Distribution remains unallocated pursuant to
                           clauses (A) and (B), the Exchange Agent shall
                           reallocate the portion of the Southside Merger
                           Consideration payable to each holder of Cash
                           Election Shares (other than Dissenting Shares)
                           (based upon the number of Cash Election Shares
                           (other than Dissenting Shares) owned by such
                           holder as compared with the total number of Cash
                           Election Shares (other than Dissenting Shares)
                           owned by all such holders), such that all of the
                           holders of Cash Election Shares will receive in
                           the aggregate the number of shares of Surviving
                           Corporation Common Stock which will equal the
                           number of shares by which the Stock Election
                           Shares and the Combined Election Shares
                           (including the Combined Election Shares converted
                           pursuant to clause (B) above) are less than the
                           Stock Conversion Number, and such holders shall
                           receive the balance of the Southside Merger
                           Consideration, if any, to which each such holder
                           is entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger in
                           cash (determined by (x) dividing the total Stock
                           Distribution to be received by such holder after
                           giving effect to the reallocation described in
                           this Section 1.08(f) by 1.39, (y) subtracting the
                           result in (x) from the number of shares of
                           Southside Common Stock owned by such holder at
                           the Effective Time, and (z) multiplying the
                           difference determined in (y) by $14.00 per
                           share).

                           (ii) If the number of shares of Surviving
                  Corporation Common Stock issuable in respect of the Stock
                  Election Shares (including No Election Shares) and the
                  Stock Distribution portion of the Combined Election Shares
                  is greater than the Stock Conversion Number, then the
                  Exchange Agent shall determine the aggregate number of
                  shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock issuable
                  pursuant to the Stock Distribution portion of the Combined
                  Distribution and to the Stock Distribution and shall
                  subtract from such number the Stock Conversion Number (the
                  difference is hereinafter referred to as the "Excess
                  Shares"), and then:

                                    (A) First, all of the Cash Election
                           Shares and the portion of the Cash Distribution
                           specified or deemed specified on the Election
                           Forms by holders of Combination Election Shares
                           shall be converted into the right to receive the
                           Cash Distribution elected pursuant to the
                           applicable Election Forms; and

                                    (B) Second, the Exchange Agent shall
                           reallocate the Southside Merger Consideration
                           payable to the holders of the No Election Shares
                           so as to reduce the number of Excess Shares to
                           zero, or as close as possible to zero. The number
                           of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock
                           to be received by each such holder shall be
                           reduced by the lesser of the total number of

                           pro rata percentage of the aggregate No Election
                           Shares (based upon the number of No Election
                           Shares owned by such holder as compared with the
                           total number of No Election Shares). In lieu of
                           the issuance of such shares of Surviving
                           Corporation Common Stock, the holders of No

                           to $14.00 for each such share of Southside Common
                           Stock not so converted into the right to receive
                           Surviving Corporation Common Stock; and

                                    (C) Third, if the reallocation set forth
                           in clause (B) immediately above is not sufficient
                           to reduce the number of Excess Shares to zero,
                           then the Exchange Agent shall thereafter
                           reallocate the Southside Merger Consideration
                           payable to each holder of Combined Election
                           Shares so as to reduce the number of Excess
                           Shares to zero, or as close as possible to zero.
                           The number of shares of Surviving Corporation
                           Common Stock to be received by each such holder
                           shall be reduced by the lesser of the total
                           number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common
                           Stock issuable to such holder as Southside Merger
                           Consideration, and a number determined by (x)
                           multiplying the number of Excess Shares deemed
                           outstanding after giving effect to the
                           reallocation set forth in clause (B) immediately
                           above by (y) the holder's pro rata percentage of
                           the aggregate Stock Distribution requested by all
                           of the holders of the Combined Election Shares
                           (based upon the total amount of Stock
                           Distribution requested to be received by such
                           holder of Combined Election Shares as compared
                           with the total amount of Stock Distribution
                           requested to be received by all holders of

                           Common Stock, the holders of Combined Election
                           Shares shall receive a cash payment equal to
                           $14.00 for each such share of Southside Common
                           Stock not converted into the right to receive
                           Surviving Corporation Common Stock; and

                           forth in clause (C) immediately above is not
                           sufficient to reduce the number of Excess Shares
                           to zero, then the Exchange Agent shall thereafter
                           reallocate the Southside Merger Consideration
                           payable to the holders of the Stock Election
                           Shares so as to reduce the number of Excess
                           Shares to zero. The number of shares of Surviving
                           Corporation Common Stock to be received by each
                           such holder shall be reduced by a number
                           determined by (x) multiplying the number of
                           Excess Shares deemed outstanding after giving
                           effect to the reallocation described in clauses
                           (B) and (C) immediately above by (y) the holder's
                           pro rata percentage of the aggregate Stock
                           Election Shares (not including the No Election
                           Shares) (based upon the number of Stock Election
                           Shares (not including the No Election Shares)
                           owned by such holder as compared with the total
                           number of Stock Election Shares (not including
                           the No Election Shares) owned by all holders). In

                           issuance of such shares of Surviving Corporation
                           Common Stock, the holders of Stock Election Shares
                           shall receive a cash payment equal to $14.00 for
                           each such share of Southside Common Stock not
                           converted into the right to receive Surviving
                           Corporation Common Stock.

         The term "Stock Conversion Number" shall mean a number of shares of
         Surviving Corporation Common Stock determined by dividing the
         number of shares of Southside Common Stock outstanding immediately
         prior to the Effective Time by two, and multiplying the resulting
         number by 1.39 (as such exchange ratio may be adjusted herein).

                  (g) The computation of Excess Shares, the pro rata
         computations utilized in the reallocations and the reallocated
         payments of the Southside Merger Consideration contemplated by
         Section 1.08(f) of this Agreement shall be made by the Exchange
         Agent in the reasonable exercise of its discretion.

                  (h) Each separate entry on the Southside Shareholder List
         shall be presumed to represent a separate and distinct holder of
         record of Southside Common Stock. Shares held of record by a bank,
         trust company, broker, dealer or other recognized nominee shall be
         deemed to be held by a single holder unless the nominee advises the
         Exchange Agent otherwise in writing. In such case, each of the
         beneficial owners will be treated as a separate holder and either
         directly or through such nominee may submit a separate Election
         Form for shares of Southside Common Stock that are beneficially
         owned.

                  (i) Any provisions of the preceding clauses of this
         Section 1.08 to the contrary notwithstanding, if a holder of
         Southside Common Stock in two or more different names so certifies
         in writing on or before the Election Deadline, such shareholder may
         submit a single Election Form for all such shares subject to the
         certification and shall be treated for purposes of this Section
         1.08 as a single holder.

         1.09     Exchange Procedures.
                  -------------------

                  (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) Allegiant
         shall deliver to the Exchange Agent cash, in immediately available
         funds, equal to the aggregate Cash Distribution; and (ii) Southside
         shall deliver to the Exchange Agent irrevocable instructions
         consistent with this Agreement to issue shares of Surviving
         Corporation Common Stock equal to the aggregate Stock Distribution.
         Such cash shall be held in trust by the Exchange Agent in an
         interest bearing account for disbursement to holders of Southside
         Common Stock or return to the Surviving Corporation as set forth
         herein.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, Southside and Allegiant shall
         be deemed to have granted the Exchange Agent the requisite power
         and authority to effect for Southside and Allegiant the issuance of
         the number of shares of Surviving Corporation to be issued in the
         Merger and the payment of the amount of cash to be paid in the
         Merger.

                  (c) Within five (5) business days after the Effective
         Time, Allegiant shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail or cause to
         be mailed to holders of Certificates, as identified on the
         Southside Shareholder List, letters advising such holders of the
         effectiveness of the Merger and instructing such holders to tender
         such Certificates to the Exchange Agent, or in lieu thereof, such
         evidence of lost, stolen or mutilated Certificates and such surety
         bond or other security as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require
         (the "Required Documentation").

                  (d) Subject to Section 1.12, after the Effective Time,
         each holder of a Certificate that surrenders such Certificate or in
         lieu thereof, the Required Documentation, to the Exchange Agent,
         with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal with
         respect to such Certificate (in form reasonably satisfactory to
         Allegiant and Southside), will be entitled to a certificate or
         certificates representing the stock component of the Southside
         Merger Consideration and/or a payment representing the cash
         component of the Southside Merger Consideration as set forth in
         Sections 1.07 and 1.08.

                  (e) After the Effective Time, each outstanding
         Certificate, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, shall be
         deemed to evidence ownership of the Southside Merger Consideration
         into which the stock previously represented by such Certificate
         shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

                  (f) After the Effective Time, holders of Certificates
         shall cease to have rights with respect to the stock previously
         represented by such Certificates, and their sole rights shall be to
         exchange such Certificates for the Southside Merger Consideration
         to which the shareholder may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
         of Sections 1.07 and 1.08 hereof. After the closing of the transfer
         books as described in Section 1.12(a) hereof, there shall be no
         further transfer on the records of Southside of Certificates, and
         if such Certificates are presented to Southside for transfer, they
         shall be canceled against delivery of the Southside Merger
         Consideration. Neither Surviving Corporation nor the Exchange Agent
         shall be obligated to deliver the Southside Merger Consideration
         until such holder surrenders the Certificates or furnishes the
         Required Documentation as provided herein. Surviving Corporation
         shall have the right to withhold any applicable taxes. No interest
         shall accrue on Cash Distributions or the cash portion of the
         Combined Distributions specified in the Election Forms pursuant to
         Section 1.08(b). No dividends or distributions declared after the
         Effective Time on the Surviving Corporation Common Stock will be
         remitted to any person entitled to receive Surviving Corporation
         Common Stock under this Agreement until such person surrenders the
         Certificate representing the right to receive such Surviving
         Corporation Common Stock or furnishes the Required Documentation,
         at which time such dividends or distributions shall be remitted to
         such person, without interest and less any taxes that may have been
         imposed thereon. Certificates surrendered for exchange by an
         "affiliate" of Southside as determined pursuant to Section 5.06,
         shall not be exchanged until Surviving Corporation has received a
         written agreement from such affiliate if required pursuant to
         Section 5.06 hereof.

                  (g) At any time following the sixth (6th) month after the
         Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
         require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
         funds which had been made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant
         to Section 1.09(a) and not disbursed to holders of shares of
         Southside Common Stock (including, without limitation, all interest
         and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all
         amounts of funds made available to it), and thereafter each such
         holder shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation
         (subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws),
         and only as general creditors thereof, with respect to any
         Southside Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due
         surrender of the Certificates held by such holder (or the Required
         Documentation). If any Certificates (or the Required Documentation)
         shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on
         which the Southside Merger Consideration in respect of such
         Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
         any Regulatory Authority, any such cash, shares, dividends or
         distributions payable in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
         extent permitted by applicable law or regulation, become the
         property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims
         or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation
         nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a share of
         Southside Common Stock for any Southside Merger Consideration
         delivered in respect of such share of Southside Common Stock to a
         public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or
         other similar laws.

                  (h) Unless otherwise required by Allegiant or Surviving
         Corporation, holders of certificates formerly representing
         Allegiant Common Stock shall not be required to exchange such
         certificates for certificates representing Surviving Corporation
         Common Stock; provided, however, that if an exchange of such
         certificates is required by law or applicable rule or regulation,
         Allegiant will cause the Surviving Corporation to arrange for such
         exchange in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.

                  (i) Surviving Corporation will pay to the applicable
         taxing authority in strict accordance with applicable laws all
         taxes withheld by Surviving Corporation in accordance with this
         Agreement.

         1.10     No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of
                  --------------------
this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for fractional shares of
Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. Each
holder of Southside Common Stock who otherwise would have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (after taking into
account all shares of Southside Common Stock held by such holder) shall
receive (by check from the Exchange Agent, mailed to the shareholder with
the certificate(s) for Surviving Corporation Common Stock which such holder
is to receive pursuant to the Merger) in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest and subject to the payment of any applicable withholding taxes) in
an amount determined by multiplying the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled by $14.00. No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any
fractional share.

         1.11     Dissenting Shares.
                  -----------------

                  (a) "Dissenting Shares" means any shares of Southside
         Common Stock or Allegiant Common Stock held by any holder who
         becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares under
         Section 351.455 of the Missouri Statute. Any holders of Dissenting
         Shares shall be entitled to payment for such shares only to the
         extent permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of the
         Missouri Statute; provided, however, that if, in accordance with
         the Missouri Statute, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall forfeit
         such right to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares,
         (i) each such share which represented Southside Common Stock shall
         thereupon be No Election Shares and (ii) each such share which
         represented Allegiant Common Stock shall be deemed to have been
         converted into and to have become exchangeable for, as of the
         Effective Time, the right to receive one share of Surviving
         Corporation Common Stock.

                  (b) Southside shall give to Allegiant (i) prompt notice of
         any written objections to the Merger and/or any written demands for
         the payment of the fair value of any shares of Southside Common
         Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments
         served pursuant to Section 351.455 of the Missouri Statute received
         by Southside, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
         negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands under the
         Missouri Statute. Southside shall not voluntarily make any payment
         with respect to demands for payment of fair value and shall not,
         except with the prior consent of Allegiant (which shall not be
         unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), settle or offer to
         settle any such demands.

         1.12     Closing of Stock Transfer Books.
                  -------------------------------

                  (a) The stock transfer books of Southside shall be closed
         at the end of business on the business day immediately preceding
         the Closing Date. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
         Southside Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
         records prior to the closing of such record books, the Southside
         Merger Consideration issuable or payable with respect to such stock
         may be delivered to the transferee, if the Certificate or
         Certificates representing such stock (or the Required
         Documentation) is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by
         all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and all
         applicable stock transfer taxes are paid.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, Southside shall cause its
         transfer agent to provide Allegiant and the Exchange Agent with a
         complete and verified list of registered holders of Southside
         Common Stock based upon its stock transfer books or corporate
         records as of the closing of said transfer books, including the
         names, addresses, certificate numbers and taxpayer identification
         numbers of such holders (the "Southside Shareholder List").
         Allegiant and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
         Southside Shareholder List to establish the identity of those
         persons entitled to receive the Southside Merger Consideration,
         which list shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
         of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock represented by any
         Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deposit any
         Southside Merger Consideration


                                   - 12 -

         represented thereby in escrow with an independent third party and
         thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

         1.13     Anti-Dilution. If between the date of this Agreement and the
                  -------------
Effective Time a share of Allegiant Common Stock shall be changed into a
different number of shares of Allegiant Common Stock or a different class of
shares (or if a record date is established within such period for such
purpose) by reason of reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period, then
appropriate and proportionate adjustment or adjustments will be made to the
Stock Distribution and the Surviving Corporation Common Stock portion of the
Combined Distributions as specified in the Election Forms pursuant to
Section 1.08(b) or as further adjusted pursuant to Section 1.08(f) such that
each holder of Southside Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such
number of shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock or other securities
as such shareholder would have received pursuant to such reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment
or as a result of such stock dividend if such had been declared by the
Surviving Corporation and had the record date therefor been immediately
following the Effective Time.

         1.14     Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger will
                  ----------------
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of
the Code and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization"
for purposes of Section 368 of the Code. Each of Southside and Allegiant
hereby agree to file any and all tax returns in a manner consistent with the
qualification as such.

         1.15     Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, the term
                  -----------------------
"Material Adverse Effect" with respect to either Southside or Allegiant, as
the case may be, means any condition, event, change or occurrence that has a
material adverse effect on the condition (financial or otherwise),
properties, business or results of operations, of such entity and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as reflected, respectively, in the Southside
Financial Statements or the Allegiant Financial Statements, as the case may
be; it being understood that a Material Adverse Effect shall not include:
(i) a change with respect to, or effect on, such entity and its Subsidiaries
resulting from a change in law, rule, regulation, generally accepted
accounting principles or regulatory accounting principles; (ii) a change
with respect to, or effect on, such entity and its Subsidiaries resulting
from any other matter affecting depository institutions generally including,
without limitation, changes in general economic conditions and changes in
prevailing interest and deposit rates; (iii) a change disclosed in,
respectively, the Southside Financial Statements or the Allegiant Financial
Statements, as the case may be; or (iv) in the case of Southside, any
financial change resulting from adjustments made pursuant to Section 5.05 or
5.08(b) hereof.

         1.16     Knowledge. As used in this Agreement, the term "knowledge" or
                  ---------
"best knowledge" shall mean those facts known by the executive officers of
Allegiant or Southside, as the case may be.

         1.17     Disclosure Schedules; Standard.
                  ------------------------------

                  (a) Southside has delivered to Allegiant a confidential
         schedule and Allegiant has delivered to Southside a confidential
         schedule (respectively, its "Disclosure Schedule"), executed by
         Southside and Allegiant concurrently with the delivery and
         execution hereof, setting forth, among other things, items the
         disclosures of which shall be necessary or appropriate either in
         response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
         provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations
         or warranties contained in Article II hereof, in the case of
         Southside, or Article III hereof, in the case of Allegiant;
         provided that (i) no such item shall be required to be set forth in
         the Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
         warranty if its absence would not be reasonably likely to result in
         the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or
         incorrect under the standard established by Section 1.17(b) hereof,
         and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Disclosure Schedule
         as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed
         an admission by Southside or Allegiant, as the case may be, that
         such item represents a material exception or a fact, event or
         circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a
         Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) No representation or warranty of Southside contained
         in Article II hereof or Allegiant contained in Article III hereof
         shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and Southside and Allegiant,
         as the case may be, shall not be deemed to have breached a
         representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence of
         any fact, event or circumstance unless such fact, event or
         circumstance, individually or taken together with all other facts,
         events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or
         warranty contained in Article II hereof, in the case of Southside,
         or Article III hereof, in the case of Allegiant, has had a Material
         Adverse Effect on the party making such representation or warranty.

                  (c) Southside and Allegiant shall be permitted to update
         and supplement their respective Disclosure Schedules so as to
         disclose exceptions to one or more representations or warranties
         contained in Article II hereof in the case of Southside and Article
         III hereof in the case of Allegiant which are a result of events
         which occur after the date hereof; provided, however, that,
         anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) no exceptions
         or other information set forth on any such updated or supplemented
         Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to cure any representation or
         warranty which was not true and correct as of the date of this
         Agreement, and (ii) the exceptions and other information set forth
         on any such updated or supplemented Disclosure Schedule shall not
         be taken into consideration in determining, for purposes of this
         Agreement, whether the conditions set forth in Section 6.02(a) in
         the case of Southside, and Section 6.03(a) hereof in the case of
         Allegiant shall have been satisfied, and (iii) this Section 1.17(c)
         shall not relieve any party of its obligations under any covenant
         set forth herein.

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SOUTHSIDE
                 -------------------------------------------

         As an inducement to Allegiant to enter into and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, and notwithstanding any examinations,
inspections, audits or other investigations made by Allegiant, subject to
Section 1.17 hereof and except as set forth in a section of the Disclosure

                                                   -------------

         2.02     Subsidiaries.
                  ------------

                  (a) Schedule 2.02 sets forth a complete and correct list
                      -------------
         of all of Southside's Subsidiaries (each a "Southside Subsidiary"
         and, collectively, the "Southside Subsidiaries"), and all
         outstanding Equity Securities of each Southside Subsidiary, all of
         which are owned directly or indirectly by Southside. "Equity
         Securities" of an issuer means capital stock or other equity
         securities of such issuer, options, warrants, scrip, rights to
         subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever

         contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which
         such issuer is or may become bound to issue additional shares of
         its capital stock or other equity securities of such issuer, or
         options, warrants, scrip or rights to purchase, acquire, subscribe
         to, calls on or commitments for any shares of its capital stock or
         other equity securities. All of the outstanding shares of capital
         stock of the Southside Subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by
         Southside are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are
         owned free and clear of any lien, claim, charge, option,
         encumbrance, agreement, mortgage, pledge, security interest or
         restriction (a "Lien") with respect thereto. Each of the Southside
         Subsidiaries is a corporation, bank or savings bank duly
         incorporated or organized and validly existing under the laws of
         its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, and has
         corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
         assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted.
         Each of the Southside Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business
         in each jurisdiction where its ownership or leasing of property or
         the conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified. Neither
         Southside nor any Southside Subsidiary owns beneficially, directly
         or indirectly, any shares of any class of Equity Securities or
         similar interests of any corporation, bank,

         partnership or joint venture of any kind, other than those
         identified as Southside Subsidiaries in Schedule 2.02 hereof.
                                                 -------------

                  (b) SOUTH SIDE NATIONAL BANK ("SNB") is a national banking
         association duly organized and validly existing under the laws of
         the United States of America. Each of the Southside Subsidiaries,
         except SNB, are commercial banks duly organized, validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws of the State of Missouri. The
         deposits of the Southside Subsidiaries are insured by the Federal
         Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC") under the Federal
         Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, as amended (the "FDI Act").

         2.03     Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of Southside
                  --------------
consists of 15,000,000 shares of Southside Common Stock, of which, as of
December 31, 2000, 8,393,528 shares were issued and outstanding and

-------------
("Southside Employee Stock Options") covering 531,000 shares of Southside
Common Stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2000. Since December 31,
2000, no Equity Securities of Southside have been issued, other than shares
of Southside Common Stock which may have been issued upon the exercise of
Southside Stock Options. Except for the Southside Stock Plans and the
Southside Rights Agreement, Southside does not have and is not bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the issuance of any share of
Southside Common Stock or any other Equity Securities of Southside. No
shares of Southside Common Stock have been issued nor are any shares of
Southside Common Stock issuable in violation of any preemptive rights. All
of the issued and outstanding shares of Southside Common Stock are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and have not been issued in violation
of any preemptive right of any shareholder of Southside. At the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation Common Stock to be issued in the Merger will
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and will
not be issued in violation of any preemptive right of any shareholder of
Southside.

                  (b) There is no pending action involving Southside or any
         of the Southside Subsidiaries as to the title of or the right to use

         not past due, and (vi) other immaterial Liens and encumbrances
         incurred in the ordinary course of business.

                  (g) Neither Southside nor any of the Southside
         Subsidiaries has caused or allowed the generation, treatment,
         storage, disposal or release at any Real Property of any Toxic
         Substance, except in accordance in all material respects with all
         applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. "Toxic
         Substance" means any hazardous, toxic or dangerous substance,
         pollutant, waste, gas or material, including, without limitation,
         petroleum and petroleum products, metals, liquids, semi-solids or
         solids, that are regulated under any federal, state or local

         or under any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property.

                  (h) Each of the leases for the Leased Real Property is in
         full force and effect on the date hereof and has not been modified
         or amended in any respect from the forms heretofore provided to
         Allegiant. Neither Southside, nor to the knowledge of Southside,
         any third party is in default under any leases for Southside Leased
         Property nor has any event occurred which, through the passage of
         time or the giving of notice (including, without limitation, the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
         or both, would constitute a default thereunder or would cause the
         acceleration of any obligation of any party thereto or the creation
         of a lien or encumbrance upon any of Southside's assets. The leases
         for the Leased Real Property are the valid and binding obligations
         of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries thereto and, to the
         knowledge of Southside, the other parties thereto in accordance
         with their terms and conditions, except as the enforceability
         thereof against the parties thereto may be limited by bankruptcy,
         insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws now or
         hereafter in effect relating to the enforcement of creditors'
         rights generally, and except that equitable principles may limit
         the right to obtain specific performance or other

         copies of all the leases for the Leased Real Property to Allegiant.

         2.09     Taxes. Southside and each Southside Subsidiary have timely
                  -----
filed all material income tax returns required to be filed ("Southside
Returns"). Each of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries has paid, or set
up adequate reserves on the Southside Financial Statements for the payment
of, all income taxes shown on the Southside Returns required to be paid in
respect of the periods covered by such Southside Returns. Neither Southside
nor any Southside Subsidiary has any material liability for any such income
taxes in excess of the amounts so paid or reserves so established and, to
the knowledge of Southside, no material deficiencies for any such income
tax, have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing (tentatively or
definitely) against Southside or any of the Southside Subsidiaries which
have not been settled or would not be covered by existing reserves. Neither
Southside nor any of the Southside Subsidiaries is delinquent in the payment
of any material income tax nor has it requested any extension of time within
which to file any income tax returns in respect of any fiscal year which
have not since been filed and no requests for waivers of the time to assess
any tax are pending. No federal or state income tax return of Southside or
any Southside Subsidiaries has been audited by the IRS or any state tax

                  (d) As of December 31, 2000, the aggregate amount of all
         Non-Performing Assets on the books of Southside and the Southside
         Subsidiaries did not exceed $6,500,000. "Non-Performing Assets"
         shall mean (i) all loans (A) that are contractually past due 90
         days or more in the payment of principal and/or interest, (B) that
         are on nonaccrual status, (C) that have been classified "doubtful,"
         "loss" or the equivalent thereof by any Regulatory Agency or (D)
         where the interest rate terms have been reduced and/or the maturity
         dates have been extended subsequent to the agreement under which
         the loan was originally created due to concerns regarding the
         borrower's ability to pay in accordance with such initial terms,
         and (ii) all assets classified by Southside or its Subsidiaries,
         for purposes of this Section 2.18, or Allegiant or its
         Subsidiaries, for purposes of Section 3.13, as real estate acquired
         through foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure, including
         in-substance foreclosures, and all other assets acquired through
         foreclosure or in lieu of foreclosure.

                  (e) All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued
         interest entered on the books of Southside and the Southside
         Subsidiaries arose out of bona fide arm's length transactions, were
         made for good and valuable consideration in the ordinary course of
         Southside's or the appropriate Southside Subsidiary's respective
         business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with
         respect to such loans or discounts are true and genuine and are
         what they purport to be. To the knowledge of Southside, the loans,
         discounts and the accrued interest reflected on the books of
         Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries are subject to no
         defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (including, without limitation,
         those afforded by usury or truth-in-lending laws), except as may be
         provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
         creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity.

                  (f) The notes and other evidences of indebtedness
         evidencing the loans described in Section 2.18(e) above, and all
         pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other collateral documents
         or security instruments relating thereto are and will be, in all
         material respects, valid, true, genuine and enforceable, and what
         they purport to be. Southside and each of the Southside
         Subsidiaries has good and valid title to the investment securities
         shown on the Southside Financial Statements and all securities
         entered on the books of Southside or the appropriate Southside
         Subsidiary subsequent to March 31, 2001, except for those sold or
         redeemed in the ordinary course of business. A complete and
         accurate list of such investment securities as of March 31, 2001 is
         attached as Schedule 2.18(f).

         directors, officers, or other employees of and/or consultants to
         Southside or any of the Southside Subsidiaries (collectively,

         and the material requirements of all applicable statutes, orders,
         rules and final regulations, including, without limitation, to the
         extent applicable, ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
         amended (the "Code"). All contributions required to be made to
         Southside Employee Plans have been made or reserved on the

         which is a pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA)(the
         "Pension Plans"): (i) each Pension Plan which is intended to be
         "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has
         been determined to be so qualified by the IRS and such
         determination letter may still be relied upon, and each related

         of the assets of the Pension Plan allocable to such vested or
         accrued benefits; (iii) there has been no "prohibited transaction,"
         as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406
         of ERISA, which could subject any Pension Plan or associated trust,
         or Southside or any of the Southside Subsidiaries, to any material
         tax or penalty; (iv) no defined benefit Pension Plan or any trust
         created thereunder has been terminated, nor has there been any
         "reportable events" with respect to any Pension Plan, as that term
         is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA since January 1, 1990; and (v)
         no Pension Plan or any trust created thereunder has incurred any
         "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in
         Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived). No Pension Plan is a
         "multiemployer plan," as that term is defined in Section 3(37) of
         ERISA.

         contemplated thereby by the shareholders of Allegiant and the
         Regulatory Authorities, to carry out its obligations under this
         Agreement. The only shareholder vote required for Allegiant to

         binding obligation of Allegiant enforceable against it in accordance
         with their respective terms. Allegiant's Board of Directors has
         taken all actions so that no Missouri antitakeover measure, whether

         applicable Missouri law, or otherwise will apply to the Merger or
         this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

                  (b) Neither the execution, delivery and performance by
         Allegiant of this Agreement or the Southside or Allegiant Voting
         Agreements, nor the consummation by Allegiant of the transactions
         contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance by Allegiant with
         any of the provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) violate, conflict
         with or result in a breach of any provisions of, or constitute a
         default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
         would constitute a default) or result in the termination of, or
         accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of
         termination or acceleration of, or result in the creation of, any
         Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Allegiant or any of
         the Allegiant Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or
         provisions of (x) its Articles of Incorporation, charter or
         By-Laws, or (y) any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust,
         license, lease, agreement or other instrument or obligation to
         which Allegiant or any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries is a party or
         by which it may be bound, or to which Allegiant or any of the

together with any required amendments thereto, that it was required to file
with any Regulatory Authority. All such reports and statements filed with
any such Regulatory Authority are collectively referred to herein as the
"Allegiant Reports." As of its respective date, each Allegiant Report
complied in all material respects with all the rules and regulations
promulgated by the applicable Regulatory Authority and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. With respect to Allegiant Reports filed with the Regulatory
Authorities, there is no material unresolved violation, criticism or
exception by any Regulatory Authority with respect to any report or
statement filed by, or any examinations of, Allegiant or any of the
Allegiant Subsidiaries.

to be paid in respect of the periods covered by such Allegiant Returns.
Neither Allegiant nor any Allegiant Subsidiary has any material liability for
any such income taxes in excess of the amounts so paid or reserves so
established and, to the knowledge of Allegiant, no material deficiencies for
any such income tax, have been proposed, asserted or assessed in writing
(tentatively or definitely) against Allegiant or any of the Allegiant
Subsidiaries which have not been settled or would not be covered by existing
reserves. Neither Allegiant nor any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries is
delinquent in the payment of any material income tax nor has it requested any
extension of time within which to file any income tax returns in respect of
any fiscal year which have not since been filed and no requests for waivers
of the time to assess any tax are pending. No federal or state income tax
return of Allegiant or any Allegiant Subsidiaries has been audited by the IRS
or any state tax authority for the three (3) most recent full calendar years.
There is no deficiency or refund litigation with respect to the Allegiant
Returns. Neither Allegiant nor any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries has extended
or waived any statute of limitations that is currently in effect on the

         any Allegiant Property is not in substantial compliance with any of
         the statutes, regulations or ordinances that such Regulatory
         Authority enforces, (ii) threatening to revoke any license,
         franchise, permit or governmental authorization, including, without
         limitation, such company's status as an insured depository
         institution under the FDI Act, or (iii) requiring or threatening to
         require Allegiant or any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries, or
         indicating that Allegiant or any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries may
         be required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or
         memorandum of understanding or any other agreement restricting or
         limiting or purporting to direct, restrict or limit in any manner
         the operations of Allegiant or any of the Allegiant Subsidiaries,
         including, without limitation, any restriction on the payment of
         dividends. No such cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum
         of understanding or other agreement is currently in effect.

                  (e) Neither Allegiant nor any of the Allegiant
         Subsidiaries is required by Section 32 of the FDI Act to give prior
         notice to any federal banking agency of the proposed addition of an
         individual to its board of directors or the employment of an
         individual as a senior executive officer.

         3.13     Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses; Non-Performing Assets;
                  -----------------------------------------------------------
                  Financial Assets.
                  -----------------

                  (a) All of the accounts, notes and other receivables that
         are reflected in the Allegiant Financial Statements as of December
         31, 2000, were acquired in the ordinary course of business and were
         collectible in full in the ordinary course of business, except for
         probable loan and lease losses that are adequately provided for in
         the allowance for loan and lease losses reflected in such Allegiant
         Financial Statements, and the collection experience of Allegiant
         and the Allegiant Subsidiaries since December 31, 2000 to the date
         hereof, has not deviated in any material and adverse manner from
         the credit and collection experience of Allegiant and the Allegiant
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for the three months ended December
         31, 2000.

                  (b) The allowances for loan losses contained in the
         Allegiant Financial Statements were established in accordance with
         the past practices and experiences of Allegiant and the Allegiant
         Subsidiaries, and the allowance for loan and lease losses shown on
         the consolidated balance sheet of Allegiant and the Allegiant
         Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000, were adequate in all material
         respects under the requirements of GAAP, or regulatory accounting
         principles, as the case may be, to provide for probable losses on
         loans and leases (including, without limitation, accrued interest
         receivable) and credit commitments (including, without limitation,
         stand-by letters of credit) as of the date of such balance sheet.

                  (c) Schedule 3.13(c) sets forth as of March 31, 2001 all
                      ----------------
         assets classified by Allegiant as real estate acquired through
         foreclosure or repossession, including foreclosed assets.

                  (d) As of December 31, 2000, the aggregate amount of all
         Non-Performing Assets on the books of Allegiant and the Allegiant
         Subsidiaries did not exceed $3,400,000.

                  (e) All loans receivable (including discounts) and accrued
         interest entered on the books of Allegiant and the Allegiant
         Subsidiaries arose out of bona fide arm's length transactions, were
         made for good and valuable consideration in the ordinary course of
         Allegiant's or the appropriate Allegiant Subsidiary's respective
         business, and the notes or other evidences of indebtedness with
         respect to such loans or discounts are true and genuine and are
         what they purport to be. To the knowledge of Allegiant, the loans,
         discounts and the accrued interest reflected on the books of
         Allegiant and the Allegiant Subsidiaries are subject to no
         defenses, set-offs or counterclaims (including, without limitation,
         those afforded by usury or truth-in-lending laws), except as may be
         provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
         creditors' rights generally or by general principles of equity.

                  (f) The notes and other evidences of indebtedness
         evidencing the loans described in Section 3.13 above, and all
         pledges, mortgages, deeds of trust and other collateral documents
         or security instruments relating thereto are and will be, in all
         material respects, valid, true, genuine and enforceable, and what
         they purport to be.

         4.01     Conduct of Businesses Prior to the Effective Time. During the
                  -------------------------------------------------
period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Southside and
each of the Southside Subsidiaries shall conduct their businesses according
to the ordinary and usual course consistent with past and current practices
and shall use their best efforts to maintain and preserve their business

         foregoing actions or engage in any activity, enter into any

         4.03     Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation.
                  -------------------------------------------

                  (a) Southside agrees that it shall not, nor shall it
         authorize or knowingly permit any officer, director, employee,
         investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent or other advisor or
         representative of Southside, directly or indirectly, to (i)
         solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the
         submission of any Acquisition Proposal for Southside from and after
         the date hereof, (ii) participate in any discussions or
         negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any information
         with respect to, or take any other action knowingly to facilitate
         any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an
         Acquisition Proposal for Southside from and after the date hereof,
         (iii) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar
         agreement with respect to any class of Southside Equity Securities
         or (iv) enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition
         Proposal for Southside; provided, however, that if, at any time
         prior to the Southside shareholder approval pursuant to Section
         5.03(a), Southside's Board of Directors reasonably determines in
         good faith, after consultation with and receipt of advice from
         outside counsel and independent financial advisor of Southside,
         that failing to take such action would be inconsistent with its
         fiduciary duties to Southside's shareholders under applicable law,
         Southside may, in response to an Acquisition Proposal for Southside
         made after the date of this Agreement which was not solicited by
         Southside or its representatives or agents and which did not
         otherwise result from a breach of this Section 4.03, and which is
         reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, and subject to
         compliance with Section 4.03(c); (x) furnish information with
         respect to Southside to any person pursuant to a customary
         confidentiality agreement including customary standstill provisions
         (as determined by Southside after consultation with its outside
         counsel) and (y) participate in negotiations regarding such
         Acquisition Proposal for Southside. "Acquisition Proposal" means
         any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to any direct or indirect
         acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of related
         transactions, of 15% or more of the assets of Southside or any of
         the Southside Subsidiaries or 15% or more of any class of Equity
         Securities of Southside or any of its Subsidiaries, any tender
         offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any
         person beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of Equity
         Securities of Southside or any of the Southside Subsidiaries, any
         merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
         recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
         involving Southside or any of the Southside Subsidiaries, other
         than the negotiations with Allegiant, or any other transaction the
         consummation of which could reasonably be expected to impede,
         interfere with, prevent or materially delay the Merger or which
         could reasonably be expected to dilute materially the benefits to
         Allegiant of the Merger.

                  (b) Neither the Board of Directors of Southside nor any
         committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, or propose publicly to
         withdraw, in a manner adverse to Allegiant, the approval or
         recommendation by such Board of Directors or such committee of the
         Merger or this Agreement, (ii) subject to Section 4.03(d), modify,
         or propose publicly to

         publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal for
         Southside or (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
         recommend, or execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement
         in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
         agreement or other similar agreement or propose publicly or agree to
         do any of the foregoing related to any Acquisition Proposal for
         Southside. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time prior to
         receipt of Southside shareholder approval of this Agreement, the
         Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, the Board of
         Directors of Southside reasonably determines, in good faith after
         consultation with the independent financial advisor of Southside,
         that it has received an Acquisition Proposal for Southside that
         constitutes a Superior Proposal which did not result from a breach
         of Southside's obligations under this Section 4.03 and also
         reasonably determines that failure to do one of the following would
         be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to Southside's
         shareholders under applicable law, the Board of Directors of
         Southside may (subject to this and the following sentences), after
         paying to Allegiant the Southside Termination Fee, (x) withdraw or
         modify its approval or recommendation of this Agreement, the Merger
         and the transactions contemplated hereby, (y) approve or recommend
         the Superior Proposal or (z) terminate this Agreement (and
         concurrently with or after such termination, if it so chooses, cause
         Southside to enter into any agreement with respect to the Superior
         Proposal), but in each of the cases set forth in clause (x), (y) or
         (z), only at a time prior to the Southside shareholder approval
         pursuant to Section 5.03(a) and only at a time that is after the
         tenth (10th) calendar day following Allegiant's receipt of written
         notice advising Allegiant that the Board of Directors of Southside
         has received a Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and
         conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying the person
         making such Superior Proposal. For all purposes of this Agreement, a
         "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide proposal made by a third
         party to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
         consisting of cash and/or securities, 100% of the Southside
         Securities then outstanding (whether pursuant to a tender or
         exchange offer, merger, consolidation, share exchange, or other
         business combination) or all or substantially all the assets of
         Southside and otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of
         Southside determines in its good faith judgment (based on a written
         opinion of Southside's financial advisor) to be materially more
         favorable to Southside and its shareholders than the Merger (taking
         into account any changes to the financial and other contractual
         terms of this Agreement proposed by Allegiant in response to such
         proposal, the person making the proposal, any legal or regulatory
         considerations and all other relevant financial and strategic
         considerations, including the timing of the consummation of such
         transactions) and for which financing, to the extent required, is
         then committed or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
         Directors of Southside, is reasonably capable of being obtained by
         such third party, provided that such proposal is reasonably
         determined by the Board of Directors of Southside, in good faith and
         after due inquiry, to be likely to be consummated.

                  (c) In addition to the obligations of Southside set forth
         in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 4.03, Southside shall
         promptly (meaning within 48 hours) advise Allegiant orally and in
         writing of any request for information or of any Acquisition

         Proposal for Southside, the material terms and conditions of such
         request or Acquisition Proposal for Southside and the identity of
         the person making such request or Acquisition Proposal for
         Southside. Southside will keep Allegiant reasonably informed of the
         status and details (including amendments or proposed amendments) of
         any such request or Acquisition Proposal for Southside. If, after
         Southside receives a Superior Proposal, Allegiant desires to
         continue negotiations with Southside with respect to the
         transactions provided for in this Agreement, Southside agrees to
         negotiate in good faith with Allegiant.

                  (d) Nothing contained in this Section 4.03 shall prohibit
         Southside from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
         contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
         Exchange Act or from making any disclosure to Southside's
         shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
         Directors of Southside, after consultation with outside counsel,
         failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
         duties to Southside's shareholders under the Missouri Statute;
         provided, however, neither Southside nor its Board of Directors nor
         any committee thereof shall, except as permitted by Section
         4.03(b), withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to withdraw or
         modify, its position with respect to the Merger or this Agreement
         or approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
         recommend, an Acquisition Proposal for Southside.

         4.04     Forbearances of Allegiant. During the period from the date of
                  -------------------------
this Agreement to the Closing Date, Allegiant shall not, without the prior
consent of Southside, agree in writing or otherwise to engage in any
activity, enter into any transaction or take or omit to take any other
action:

                  (a) that would (i) prevent or impede the Merger from
         qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
         368(a)(1)(A) of the Code or (ii) materially impede or delay the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
         the ability of Allegiant or Southside to obtain any necessary
         approvals of any Regulatory Authority required for the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement or to perform its covenants and
         agreements under this Agreement; or

                  (b) except to the extent required by law, regulation or
         any Regulatory Authority or contemplated by or expressly permitted
         pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which would make any of
         the representations and warranties of Article III of this Agreement
         untrue or incorrect in any material respect if made anew after
         engaging in such activity, entering into such transaction, or
         taking or omitting such other action.

         5.02     Regulatory Matters.

         such options, and Allegiant and the Allegiant Subsidiaries shall

         necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

         Southside shall submit for approval of Southside's shareholders the
         matters to be voted upon at such meeting. The Board of Directors of

         Southside's shareholders necessary for the approval of this
         Agreement, subject to Section 4.03.

                  (b) Allegiant shall call a special meeting of its
         shareholders to be held as soon as is reasonably possible for the

         part of the Registration Statement to be filed with the SEC by
         Southside) and mail the same to the shareholders of Allegiant. The
         Board of Directors of Allegiant shall submit for approval of

         contemplated hereby to the shareholders of Allegiant and use its
         reasonable best efforts to obtain any vote of Allegiant's

         5.04     Current Information. During the period from the date of this
                  -------------------
Agreement to the Closing Date, (i) Southside and Allegiant will promptly

Each party shall promptly notify the other party of the following events
immediately upon learning of the occurrence thereof, describing the same
and, if applicable, the steps being taken by the affected party with respect
thereto: (a) the occurrence of any event which could cause any
representation or warranty of such party or any schedule, statement, report,
notice, certificate or other writing furnished by such party to be untrue or
misleading in any material respect; (b) any Material Adverse Effect to
Southside or Allegiant; (c) the issuance or commencement of any governmental
and/or regulatory agency complaint, investigation or hearing or any
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated and, as to any
such matter which shall now or hereafter be in effect, any communications
pertaining thereto; or (d) the institution or the threat of any material
litigation involving Southside or Allegiant. Until the Effective Time,
Southside shall deliver to Allegiant monthly reports in form and pursuant to
past timing as Southside has historically provided to its board members.

         5.05     Conforming Entries.
                  ------------------

                  (a) Notwithstanding that Southside believes that Southside
         and Southside Subsidiaries have established all reserves and taken
         all provisions for probable loan losses required by GAAP and
         applicable laws, rules and regulations, Southside recognizes that
         Allegiant may have adopted different loan, accrual and reserve
         policies

         (including loan classifications and levels of reserves for probable
         loan losses). From and after the date of this Agreement, Southside
         and Allegiant shall consult and cooperate with each other with
         respect to conforming the loan, accrual and reserve policies of
         Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries, to those policies of
         Allegiant, as specified in each case in writing to Southside, based
         upon such consultation and as hereinafter provided.

                  (b) In addition, from and after the date of this
         Agreement, Southside and Allegiant shall consult and cooperate with
         each other with respect to determining appropriate Southside
         accruals, reserves and charges to establish and take in respect of
         excess equipment write-off or write-down of various assets and
         other appropriate charges and accounting adjustments taking into
         account the parties' business plans following the Merger, as
         specified in each case in writing to Southside, based upon such
         consultation and as hereinafter provided.

                  (c) Southside and Allegiant shall consult and cooperate

         timing for recognizing for financial accounting purposes
         Southside's expenses of the Merger and the restructuring charges,
         if any, related to or to be incurred in connection with the Merger.

                  (d) With respect to clauses (a) through (c) of this
         Section 5.05, it is the objective of Allegiant and Southside that
         such reserves, accruals, charges and divestitures, if any, to be
         taken shall be consistent with GAAP and shall be taken no earlier
         than immediately prior to the Merger on the Closing Date.

         5.06     Agreements of Affiliates. Allegiant shall use its best
                  ------------------------

Allegiant, as of the date hereof, or as soon as practicable hereafter, a

Agreement providing that each such person will agree not to sell, pledge,
transfer or otherwise dispose of the shares of Surviving Corporation Common

hereof, or as soon as practicable hereafter, a written agreement in
substantially the form set forth as Exhibit B to this Agreement providing
                                    ---------
that each such person will agree not to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise

         5.08     Miscellaneous Agreements and Consents.
                  -------------------------------------

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided,
         each of the parties hereto agrees to use its respective best
         efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all commercially reasonable
         actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all commercially
         reasonable things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
         laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement as expeditiously as
         possible, including, without limitation, using its respective best
         efforts to take all commercially reasonable actions to lift or
         rescind any injunction or restraining order or other order
         adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the
         transactions contemplated hereby. Each party shall, and shall cause
         each of its respective Subsidiaries to, use its best efforts to
         obtain consents of all third parties and Regulatory Authorities
         necessary or, in the opinion of Allegiant, desirable for the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be obligated to agree
         to a material restriction or condition in order to obtain such
         approvals and consents.

                  (b) Southside, prior to the Effective Time, shall (i)
         consult and cooperate with Allegiant regarding the implementation
         on or after the Effective Time of those policies and procedures
         established by Allegiant for the governance of Southside's
         Subsidiaries and not otherwise referenced in Section 5.05 hereof,

         request of Allegiant, conform on or after the Effective Time
         Southside's existing policies and procedures in respect of such
         matters to Allegiant's policies and procedures or, in the absence
         of any existing Southside policy or procedure regarding any such
         function, introduce Allegiant's policies or procedures in respect
         thereof, unless to do so would cause Southside or any of the
         Southside Subsidiaries to be in violation of any law, rule or
         regulation or requirement of any Regulatory Authority having
         jurisdiction over Southside and/or the Southside Subsidiary
         affected thereby.

         5.09     Employee Agreements and Benefits.

         compensation contracts set forth on Schedule 2.11(b) between
                                             ----------------

                  (b) Subject to Sections 5.09(d) and 5.14, the provisions
         of the Southside Stock Plans and any other plan, program or
         arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
         interest in respect of the Equity Securities of Southside or any of
         the Southside Subsidiaries shall be deleted and terminated as of

                  (c) Allegiant and Southside agree that, except as set
         forth in Sections 5.09(b) and 5.09(d) hereof, the Southside
         Employee Plans shall not be terminated by reason of the Merger but
         shall continue thereafter as plans of the Surviving Corporation
         until such time as the employees of Southside and the Southside
         Subsidiaries are integrated into Surviving Corporation's employee
         benefit plans (which plans, to the extent practicable, shall be the
         same as Allegiant's employee benefit plans) available to other
         employees of Surviving Corporation, subject to the terms and
         conditions specified in such plans and to such changes therein as
         may be necessary to reflect the consummation of the Merger.
         Allegiant and Southside agree that Surviving Corporation shall take
         such steps as are necessary or required to integrate the employees
         of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries into Surviving
         Corporation's employee benefit plans available to other employees
         of Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as soon as
         practicable after the Effective Time, with (i) full credit for
         prior service with Southside or any of the Southside Subsidiaries
         for purposes of vesting and eligibility for participation and
         benefit allocation (but not benefit accruals under any defined
         benefit plan), and co-payments and deductibles, (ii) waiver of all
         waiting periods, evidence of insurability and pre-existing
         condition exclusions or penalties, (iii) full credit for claims
         arising prior to the Effective Time for purposes of deductibles,
         out-of-pocket maximums, benefit maximums and all other similar
         limitations for the applicable plan year in which the Merger is
         consummated, and (iv) full credit for vacation accrued by employees
         of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries on or before the
         Effective Time. Allegiant and Southside agree that Surviving
         Corporation shall provide COBRA coverage for the periods and
         otherwise to the extent required by applicable law for employees
         and former employees of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries
         (and their dependents and qualified beneficiaries) who are eligible
         for COBRA coverage under the group health plans of Southside and
         the Southside Subsidiaries. Allegiant and Southside agree that
         Surviving Corporation shall provide severance benefits for
         employees of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries who terminate
         employment within six (6) months following the Effective Time equal
         to one week of salary for each year of service, vesting after three
         (3) years, not to exceed a total of ten (10) weeks of salary, and
         thereafter such employees shall receive the same severance benefits
         that Surviving Corporation provides to all other employees of
         Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation Subsidiaries
         and shall receive credit for their years of service with Southside
         and the Southside Subsidiaries. Surviving Corporation shall not
         take any action which will adversely affect the participation of
         the employees of Southside and the Southside Subsidiaries in any
         Section 125 plan maintained by Southside and the Southside
         Subsidiaries during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

                  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Southside shall split the
         Southside Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the
         "KSOP") into two plans, one plan to consist of the employee stock
         ownership plan portion of the KSOP (the "ESOP") and one plan to
         consist of the 401(k) portion of the KSOP (the "401(k)"). As of the
         Effective Time, the ESOP shall be terminated and immediately
         following the Effective Time each Acquisition Loan (as defined in
         the KSOP) shall be repaid in full with an amount of unallocated
         cash or shares of Surviving Corporation stock held in the ESOP
         having an aggregate fair market value equal to the unpaid balance
         of any such Loan at the time of


                                   - 52 -

         payment. All ESOP accounts shall fully vest and be nonforfeitable as
         of the termination of the ESOP. Following the date of this
         Agreement, Southside shall amend the KSOP to provide for its
         division into two plans and for the termination of the ESOP
         consistent with the foregoing provisions, subject to Allegiant's
         review and consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

                  As soon as practicable after the receipt of a favorable
         determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") as
         to the tax qualified status of the ESOP upon its termination under
         the Code (the "Final Determination Letter"), distributions of the
         benefits under the ESOP shall be made. From and after the date of
         this Agreement, in anticipation of such termination and
         distribution, Southside and its representatives before the
         Effective Time and Allegiant and Southside agree that Surviving
         Corporation and its representatives after the Effective Time shall
         use their best efforts to apply for and to obtain such favorable
         Final Determination Letter from the IRS.

         5.10     Press Releases. Except to the extent disclosure may be
                  --------------
required by applicable law, Southside and Allegiant shall consult with each
other as to the form and substance of any proposed press release or other
proposed public disclosure of matters related to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and each party shall have the right to
reasonably approve any proposed press release.

         5.11     State  Takeover  Statutes.  Southside and Allegiant  will
                  -------------------------
take all steps  necessary to exempt the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from any applicable Missouri state takeover law.

         5.12     Directors' and Officers' Indemnification and Insurance.
                  ------------------------------------------------------

                  (a) Allegiant and Southside agree that the Merger shall
         not affect or diminish any of the duties and obligations of
         indemnification of Southside, Allegiant or any of their respective
         Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Time in favor of
         employees, agents, directors or officers of Southside, Allegiant or
         any of their respective Subsidiaries arising by virtue of their
         respective Articles of Incorporation, charters or By-Laws in the
         form in effect at the date of this Agreement or arising by
         operation of law or arising by virtue of any contract, resolution
         or other agreement or document existing at the date of this
         Agreement, and Allegiant and Southside agree that Surviving
         Corporation shall continue such duties and obligations in full
         force and effect for so long as they would (but for the Merger)
         otherwise survive and continue in full force and effect. To the
         extent that Southside's or Allegiant's respective existing
         directors' and officers' liability insurance policy would provide
         coverage for any action or omission occurring prior to the
         Effective Time, Southside or Allegiant, as applicable, agrees to
         give proper notice to the insurance carrier and to Surviving
         Corporation of any potential claim thereunder so as to preserve
         Southside's or Allegiant's, as applicable, rights to such insurance
         coverage.

                  (b) After the Effective Time, Allegiant and Southside
         agree that Surviving Corporation will provide, or cause to be
         provided, such coverage to the officers and directors of Southside
         and the Southside Subsidiaries who shall continue as officers and


                                   - 53 -

<PAGE>


         directors of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to the
         same extent that Allegiant provides or causes to be provided such
         coverage to the other officer and directors of Surviving
         Corporation and its Subsidiaries.

                  (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
         Time, Allegiant and Southside agree that Surviving Corporation
         shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
         directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
         Southside covering past or future claims with respect to periods
         before the Effective Time (provided that Allegiant and Southside
         agree that Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies
         of comparable coverage with respect to claims arising from facts or
         events which occurred before the Effective Time); provided,
         however, that Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay
         premiums for such insurance which exceed in the aggregate 150% of
         the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, but in such
         case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.
         Prior to the Effective Time, Allegiant may request Southside to,
         and Southside shall, purchase insurance coverage, on such terms and
         conditions as shall be acceptable to Allegiant. Southside may
         purchase, as it deems necessary or appropriate, insurance coverage
         of directors and officers or a rider or endorsement to its existing
         policy, providing for coverage for securities laws claims and
         similar claims which could result from the transactions
         contemplated hereby; provided, however, any amount of such coverage
         in excess of $20,000 shall be counted against the 150% limit
         provided above and Allegiant shall have the opportunity to provide
         similar coverage through its insurance carrier if it is determined
         that such premiums will be lower than those available to Southside.

         5.13     Tax Matters.
                  -----------

                  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each party shall
         cooperate with the other party and shall use its reasonable best
         efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
         Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, and will not take any action
         reasonably likely to cause the Merger not so to qualify. Allegiant
         and Southside agree that Surviving Corporation, for the benefit of
         the Southside shareholders, shall not take any action after the
         Effective Time that would cause the Merger not to so qualify.

                  (b) Each party shall cooperate with the other party and
         shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinion
         referred to in Section 6.02(e) and in connection therewith, each of
         Southside and Allegiant shall deliver to such counsel customary and
         reasonable representation letters in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to such counsel.

         5.14     Employee Stock Options.
                  ----------------------

                  (a) At the Effective Time, without any action on the part
         of any holder of any such option, each Southside Stock Option that
         is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall
         cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Southside Common
         Stock and shall be converted automatically into an option to
         purchase shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock in an amount
         and at an exercise price determined


                                   - 54 -

         as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the
         Southside Stock Plan under which it was issued and the Southside
         Stock Option Agreement by which it is evidenced and the agreements
         evidencing grants thereunder, provided that all SouthSide Stock
         Options shall be exercisable throughout their stated terms
         regardless of any provisions therein pursuant to which they would
         otherwise terminate or expire at an earlier time due to the
         termination of employment of the holder thereof):

                           (i)    The number of shares of Surviving Corporation
                  Common Stock to be subject to each such Southside Stock
                  Option shall be equal to the product of (A) the number of
                  shares of Southside Common Stock purchasable upon exercise
                  of the Southside Stock Option immediately prior to the
                  Effective Time and (B) 1.39 (as such exchange ratio may be
                  adjusted as provided herein), the product being rounded,
                  if necessary, up or down, to the nearest whole share;
                  provided, however, that each Southside Stock Option shall,
                  in accordance with its terms, be subject to further
                  adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split,
                  stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
                  transaction subsequent to the Effective Time; and

                           (ii)   The exercise price per share of Surviving
                  Corporation Common Stock under the new option shall be
                  equal to the exercise price per share of Southside Common
                  Stock under the Southside Stock Option immediately prior
                  to the Effective Time divided by 1.39 (as such exchange
                  ratio may be adjusted as provided herein), provided that
                  such exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole
                  cent.

                  (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
         without any action on the part of any holder of any such option,
         each option to purchase shares of Allegiant Common Stock (each, an
         "Allegiant Option") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
         prior thereto shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation and
         shall cease to represent the right to acquire shares of Allegiant
         Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase
         shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock, on the same terms and
         conditions as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
         Time, except that all references to Allegiant shall be deemed to be
         references to the Surviving Corporation.

         and Allegiant shall have received a certificate of the Chief
         Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, signing solely in
         their capacities as officers of Southside, to that effect.

         received, on or shortly before the date of the mailing of the Joint
         Proxy Statement/Prospectus, from its investment banker, Legg Mason

         at the meeting of the Board of Directors of Allegiant at which this
         Agreement was approved by such Board of Directors, to the effect

         7.02     Effect of Termination.
                  ---------------------

                  (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as
         provided in Section 7.01 above, this Agreement shall forthwith
         become void and there shall be no liability on the part of
         Allegiant or Southside or their respective officers or directors
         except as set forth in the second sentence of Section 5.01 and in
         Sections 5.07, 7.02(b) and 7.02(c) which obligations shall survive
         such termination.

                  (b) In the event that (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall
         have been made known to Southside or any of the Southside
         Subsidiaries or has been made directly to holders of Southside
         Common Stock generally or any person shall have publicly announced
         an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition
         Proposal and such Acquisition Proposal or announced intention shall
         not have been withdrawn and thereafter this Agreement is terminated
         by any party pursuant to Section 7.01(b), or (B) this Agreement is
         terminated by (x) Southside pursuant to Section 7.01(g), or (y) by
         Allegiant pursuant to Section 7.01(e)(i) or 7.01(f), then Southside
         shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) days after the
         date of such termination, pay Allegiant a fee equal to the greater
         of 5% of the aggregate value of the Merger Consideration
         (determined as of the date of such termination) and $5 million (the
         "Southside Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of same day
         funds. Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding,
         the Southside Termination Fee shall be the only liability that
         Southside shall have to Allegiant in the event that this Agreement
         is terminated under the circumstances described in this Section
         7.02(b). Southside acknowledges that the agreements contained in
         this 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Allegiant would
         not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if Southside fails to
         promptly pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.02, and in
         order to obtain such payment, Allegiant commences a suit which
         results in a judgment against Southside for the Southside
         Termination Fee, Southside shall also pay to Allegiant its costs
         and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such
         suit, together with interest on the amount of the Southside
         Termination Fee at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in
         effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

                  (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (x) by
         Southside pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(i) or Section 7.01(h), (y) by
         Allegiant or Southside pursuant to Section 7.01(c)(iii) or (z) by
         Allegiant pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or 7.01(e)(ii) or Southside
         pursuant to Section 7.01(d)(ii) (provided, for purposes of this
         clause (z), only if such termination is a result of failure to
         fulfill the condition with respect to Allegiant shareholder
         approval in Section 6.01(a)), then Allegiant shall promptly, but in
         no event later than two (2) days after the date of such
         termination, pay Southside a fee equal to the greater of 5% of the
         aggregate value of the Merger Consideration (determined as of the
         date of such termination) and $5 million (the "Allegiant
         Termination Fee"), payable by wire transfer of same day funds.
         Anything to the contrary in this Agreement notwithstanding, the
         Allegiant Termination Fee shall be the only liability that
         Allegiant shall have to Southside in the event that this Agreement
         is terminated under the circumstances described in this Section
         7.02(c). Allegiant acknowledges that the


                                   - 61 -

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         agreements contained in this 7.02 are an integral part of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
         agreements, Southside would not enter into this Agreement;
         accordingly, if Allegiant fails to promptly pay any amount due
         pursuant to this Section 7.02, and in order to obtain such payment,
         Southside commences a suit which results in a judgment against
         Allegiant for the Allegiant Termination Fee, Allegiant shall also
         pay to Southside its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
         in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
         of the Allegiant Termination Fee at the prime rate of Bank of
         America, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be
         made.

         7.03     Amendment. This Agreement, the Exhibits and the Schedules
                  ---------
hereto may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken by or on behalf
of the respective Boards of Directors of Allegiant and Southside, at any
time before or after approval of this Agreement by the shareholders of
Southside; provided, however, that after any such approval by the
shareholders of Southside no such modification shall (A) alter or change the
amount of Merger Consideration to be received by holders of Southside Common
Stock as provided in this Agreement or (B) adversely affect the tax
treatment to holders of Southside Common Stock as a result of the receipt of
the Merger Consideration; and provided, further, however, that after any
such approval by the shareholders of Allegiant no such modification shall
(A) alter or change the amount of Merger Consideration to be received by
holders of Allegiant Common Stock as provided in this Agreement or (B)
adversely affect the tax treatment to holders of Allegiant Common Stock as a
result of the receipt of the Merger Consideration. This Agreement, the
Exhibits and the Schedules hereto may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of each of Allegiant and Southside.

         7.04     Waiver. Any term, condition or provision of this Agreement
                  ------
may be waived in writing at any time by the party which is, or whose
shareholders or stockholders, as the case may be, are, entitled to the
benefits thereof.

         8.02     Indemnification.
                  ---------------

                  (a) Allegiant and Southside shall, and Allegiant and
         Southside agree that Surviving Corporation shall (hereinafter, in
         such capacity being referred to as the "Indemnifying Party") agree
         to indemnify and hold harmless each other and their officers,
         directors and controlling persons (each such other party being
         hereinafter referred to, individually and/or collectively, as the
         "Indemnified Party") against any and all losses, claims, damages or
         liabilities, joint or several, to which the Indemnified Party may
         become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other
         federal or state law or regulation, at common law or otherwise,
         insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
         in respect thereof): (i) arise primarily out of any information
         furnished by the Indemnifying Party and included in the
         Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment
         therefor and supplement thereof, or in the Joint Proxy
         Statement/Prospectus, or in any amendment therefor or supplement
         thereof, or are based primarily upon any untrue statement or
         alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
         Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment
         therefor and supplement thereof, or in the Joint Proxy
         Statement/Prospectus, or in any amendment therefor or supplement
         thereof, and provided for inclusion thereof by the Indemnifying
         Party or (ii) arise primarily out of or are based primarily upon
         the omission or alleged omission by the Indemnifying Party in
         supplying information to be included in the Registration Statement
         as originally filed or in any amendment therefor and supplement
         thereof, or in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or in any
         amendment therefor and supplement thereof, a material fact required
         to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
         therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such
         Indemnified Party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses
         reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
         defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action;
         provided, however, no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be
         indemnified or held harmless hereunder for such party's gross
         negligence or willful misconduct.

                  (b) Allegiant and Southside agree that Surviving
         Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each shareholder
         of Southside who is a shareholder at the Effective Time for any
         federal, state or local income tax (including interest, additions
         to tax, and penalties) that is assessed or otherwise becomes due
         and owing with respect to Surviving Corporation Common Stock
         received by such shareholder of Southside with respect to Stock
         Election Shares or the Stock Distribution portion of Combination
         Election Shares pursuant to the Merger to the extent that the
         receipt by such shareholder of such Surviving Corporation Common
         Stock in the Merger is taxable to such shareholder with respect to
         the receipt by such shareholder of Stock Election Shares or the
         Stock Distribution portion of Combination Election Shares for
         federal, state or local income tax purposes (a "Tax Loss"). In the
         case of any Tax Loss that is indemnifiable pursuant to this Section
         8.02(b), the amount that shall be paid by Surviving Corporation
         pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.02(b) (the
         "Amount") shall be increased, in addition to the Amount, by an
         additional cash payment (the "Additional Payment") sufficient to
         put the recipient shareholder in the position such that the Amount
         plus the Additional Payment shall, after deduction of all net
         income and other taxes required to be paid by such shareholder in
         respect of the receipt of the Amount and the


                                   - 63 -

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

         Additional Payment (taking into account any allowable credits or
         deductions arising therefrom), be equal to the Amount (such increase
         being deemed to mean that the Amount is paid on an "After-Tax
         Basis"). Such calculations shall be made with respect to all such
         income taxes on the assumption that the recipient is subject to net
         income taxation at the highest applicable federal, state and local
         combined marginal income tax rate (the "Combined Tax Rate").

         If as a result of a Tax Loss occurring with respect to any taxable
         year under circumstances that require Surviving Corporation to make
         any payments described in this Section 8.02(b) with respect to such
         Tax Loss, any shareholder entitled to such payments shall recognize
         with respect to any taxable year in which such Tax Loss occurs or
         any subsequent year ending within three (3) years after the
         Effective Time any deduction, loss, credit, increased loss or
         reduced gain as a result of an increase in adjusted basis of the
         Surviving Corporation shares received pursuant to the Merger or
         other benefit that would not otherwise have been recognized but for
         such Tax Loss, such benefit shall either be taken into account in
         determining the amount payable to such shareholder pursuant to this
         Section 8.02(b), or to the extent such benefit was not so taken
         into account at the time the Amounts and Additional Amounts were
         paid pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) and if such benefits are
         recognized and taken into account in a year subsequent to a year
         with respect to which the Tax Loss occurs, but within three (3)
         years thereof, then such shareholder shall pay to Surviving
         Corporation (without adjustment for time value of money) an amount
         equal on an After-Tax Basis to the sum of (i) the reduction in
         federal, state and local income taxes, if any (computed on the
         assumption that such taxes are paid at the Combined Tax Rate),
         recognized by such shareholder attributable to any Tax Loss
         previously indemnified by Surviving Corporation hereunder and (ii)
         the reduction in federal, state and local income taxes realized by
         such shareholder as a direct result of any payment pursuant to this
         sentence.

         If the IRS proposes in writing in a 30-day letter or notice of
         deficiency an adjustment which may result in a Tax Loss, such
         affected shareholder shall, within sixty (60) days of its receipt,
         notify Surviving Corporation in writing of such adjustment and any
         reason stated therefor and of all action taken or proposed to be
         taken by the IRS and the proposed date for the commencement of such
         action (it being understood, however, that a defective notice shall
         not be cause for Surviving Corporation not to make any payment
         hereunder unless Surviving Corporation is actually prejudiced
         thereby). If Surviving Corporation shall request in writing within
         thirty (30) days after the date of such notification of Surviving
         Corporation that such matter be contested, the shareholder, at
         Surviving Corporation's sole cost and expense, shall be obligated
         to contest such proposed adjustment, including in any appropriate
         court of law (provided, however, that such shareholder shall not be
         obligated to appeal any adverse determination to the United States
         Supreme Court) and such shareholder and its counsel (who shall be
         selected at the sole discretion of Surviving Corporation) shall
         consult in good faith with Surviving Corporation regarding the
         conduct of such contest; provided, however, if there are issues
         being contested with the IRS in addition to the one giving rise to
         the Tax Loss, the shareholder may retain counsel of his choice.

         provided, further, that such shareholder shall not settle or
         otherwise compromise any such issue giving rise to any Tax Loss
         without the prior written consent of Surviving Corporation, if the
         effect of such settlement or compromise would be to impose
         liability on Surviving Corporation hereunder. Otherwise, any Amount
         and Additional Payment payable to any shareholder in the event of
         an unfavorable resolution of a contest shall be payable no sooner
         than ten (10) days after the Final Determination (as hereinafter
         defined) with respect to such contest.

         Any Amount and Additional Amount payable to any shareholder
         hereunder shall be paid no later than thirty (30) days after
         receipt of a written demand therefor from such shareholder, setting
         forth in detail the computation of such amount, but such payment
         shall not be due prior to the earlier of (i) the date such
         shareholder would pay additional income taxes on account of such
         Tax Loss (including any estimated taxes with respect thereto) or
         (ii) the date such shareholder shall suffer a reduction in the
         amount of any refund of income taxes that the shareholder would
         have been entitled to receive but for such Tax Loss.

         "Final Determination" with respect to a Tax Loss shall mean the
         earlier of (i) a decision, judgment, decree or other order by any
         court of competent jurisdiction, which decision, judgment, decree
         or other order has become final (e.g., when all allowable appeals
         thereof have been exhausted by either party to the action or the
         time for filing such appeal has expired) or the acceptance of the
         terms of an administrative determination if Surviving Corporation
         consents in writing to such acceptance, or (ii) the date of
         execution of a closing agreement entered into under Section 7121 of
         the Code or any other settlement agreement entered into in
         connection with an administrative or judicial proceeding.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, Surviving Corporation shall not
         indemnify any shareholder pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) to the
         extent that the Tax Loss is attributable, in whole or in part, to
         (i) any change in statute, code, ordinance or regulation occurring
         after the Effective Time which causes a Tax Loss, (ii) any failure
         by any shareholder to report the Merger in accordance with the
         intended treatment under this Agreement as a transaction under
         Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, (iii) a knowing failure by a
         shareholder to take reasonable action or to furnish reasonable
         cooperation to Surviving Corporation which prevents Allegiant from
         diligently fulfilling its obligations under this Section 8.02(b),
         (iv) any knowing and material written misrepresentation made by
         Southside or any officer or employee thereof to Surviving
         Corporation's counsel in connection with the rendering of the tax
         opinion contemplated by Section 6.02(e) hereof or (v) any material
         breach by Southside or any Southside Subsidiary of its
         representation and warranty under Section 2.24 hereof.

         8.03     No Assignment; Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall
                  -------------------------------------
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors (including any corporation deemed to be a successor
corporation of any of the parties by operation of law) and assigns, but
neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation set forth in any
provision hereof may be transferred or assigned (except by operation of law)
by any party hereto without the prior


                                   - 65 -

<PAGE>

written consent of the other party, and any purported transfer or assignment
in violation of this Section 8.03 shall be void and of no effect. Surviving
Corporation shall be deemed to be a successor to Allegiant and Southside
hereunder. There shall not be any third party beneficiaries of any provisions
hereof except for Sections 1.06, 1.08, 1.09, 1.10, 5.09, 5.12, 5.13, 5.14 and
8.02 which may be enforced against Allegiant or Southside, as the case may
be, by the parties therein identified or described.

         8.04     Severability. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to
                  ------------
require any party (or any subsidiary of a party) to take any action or fail
to take any action in violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation.
Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any
provision of this Agreement shall be held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement.

         8.05     No Implied Waiver. No failure or delay on the part of any
                  -----------------
party hereto to exercise any right, power or privilege hereunder or under
any instrument executed pursuant hereto shall operate as a waiver nor shall
any single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege.

         8.06     Headings. Article, section, subsection and paragraph titles,
                  --------
captions and headings herein are inserted only as a matter of convenience
and for reference, and in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope
of this Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.

         8.07     Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the Schedules and
                  ----------------
Exhibits hereto constitute the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior negotiations,
representations, warranties, commitments, offers, letters of interest or
intent, proposal letters, contracts, writings or other agreements or
understandings with respect thereto. No waiver, and no modification or
amendment, of any provision of this Agreement, shall be effective unless
specifically made in writing and duly signed by all parties thereto.

         8.08     Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
                  ------------
counterparts, and any party to this Agreement may execute and deliver this
Agreement by executing and delivering any of such counterparts, each of
which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original and all
of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

         8.09     Notices. All notices, requests, demands, claims or other
                  -------
communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be duly
