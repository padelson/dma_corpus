 1.6 Company Options. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled as follows: (i) in the case of a Vested Company Option having a per share exercise price less than the Merger Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the product of (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (2) the amount by which the Merger Consideration exceeds the per share exercise price of such Vested Company Option, or 

      ##### 

  

    

(ii) in the case of an Unvested Company Option or a Company Option having a
per share exercise price equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
such Company Option shall be cancelled without the payment of cash or
issuance of other securities in respect thereof. The cancellation of a
Company Option as provided in the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed a release of any and all rights the holder thereof had or may have had

No further transfer of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously representing any shares of Company Common Stock (other than the Rollover Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") is presented to the Paying Agent (as defined in Section 1.8(a)) or to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as provided in Section 1.8. 

  

 1.8 Surrender of Certificates. 

  

 (a) Not less than five (5) business days prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate and enter into an agreement with a bank or trust company to serve as Paying Agent in the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company and otherwise for payment in accordance with this Section 1, sufficient cash necessary for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.5(a)(iii). Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent (it being understood that any and all interest or income earned on funds made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be turned over to Parent). 

       ##### 

  

     

 (b) As promptly as practicable (and no later than five (5) business days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Stock Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Company Stock Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Company Stock Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent shall reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Upon surrender of Company Stock Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent shall reasonably require, the holder of such Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in the amount of the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to be mailed within ten (10) business days of receipt of such Company Stock Certificate and letter of transmittal, in accordance with Section 1.5(a)(iii), and the Company Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. At the sole discretion of Parent, Parent may make similar arrangements with the Paying Agent for the payment of the Option Consideration to the holders of the Company Options; _provided, however_ , that the payment of the applicable Option Consideration shall, in all events, be conditioned upon the holder of the applicable Company Option delivering to Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, a written termination agreement releasing the Company, Parent and their respective Affiliates from any and all claims the holder thereof may have in respect of such Company Option. 

   

 (c) Promptly following the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent all cash and any documents in its possession relating to the transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall terminate. Thereafter, each holder of a Company Stock Certificate shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration and may surrender such Company Stock Certificate to the Surviving Corporation or Parent and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirements. 

   

 (d) If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent (or if more than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate, the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with this Section 1\. When authorizing such issuance in exchange therefor, the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to deliver to the Paying Agent (or if more than twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may reasonably request as indemnity against any claim that may be made against 

      ##### 

  

    

the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Company Stock Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

   

 (e) Except as required by law, no dividends or other distributions with respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate. 

   

 (f) All cash paid in respect of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 1.8. 

   

 (g) The Surviving Corporation (and/or any of its Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holders of Company Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation (and/or any of its Affiliates) is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable Legal Requirement, including any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, or the holder of Company Options, with respect to which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 1.9 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to be necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

    ##### 

  

    

counsel, that such action is required in order for the Board of Directors to
comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Legal Requirements; (3) at least one business days prior to
furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into discussions
with, such Person, the Company gives Parent written notice of the identity of
such Person and of the Companys intention to furnish nonpublic information
to, or enter into discussions with, such Person; (4) the Company receives
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions
(including nondisclosure provisions, use restrictions, non-solicitation
provisions, no hire provisions and "standstill" provisions) at least as
favorable to the Company as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "); and (5) prior to furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such Person, the Company furnishes such
nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has
not been previously furnished by the Company to Parent). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that, in
the event any Representative of any of the Acquired Corporations (whether or
not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of any of the Acquired
Corporations) takes any action that, if taken by the Company, would
constitute a breach of this Section 4.3 by the Company, the taking of
such action by such Representative shall be deemed to constitute a breach of
this Section 4.3 by the Company for purposes of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If any Acquired Corporation or any Representative of any Acquired Corporation receives an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry at any time during the Pre-Closing Period, then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry) advise Parent orally and in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry (including the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry, and the terms thereof). The Company shall keep Parent fully informed with respect to the status and terms of any such Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry and any modification or proposed modification thereto. 

   

 (c) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any Person that relate to any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Inquiry. 

   

 (d) The Company shall not release or permit the release of any Person from, or waive or permit the waiver of any provision of or right under, any confidentiality, non-solicitation, no hire, "standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Acquired Corporations is a party or under which any of the Acquired Corporations has any rights, and shall enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement to the extent requested by Parent. The Company shall promptly request each Person that has executed a confidentiality or similar agreement in connection with its consideration of a possible Acquisition Transaction or equity investment to return to the Acquired Corporations all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of any of the Acquired Corporations. 

   

 4.4 Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E-3. As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC 

   ##### 

  

    

and the Company and the Parent shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the preparation of the foregoing. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of
the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders at the
earliest practicable time after the resolution of any such comments.
The Company shall notify the Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any
request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3
and shall supply the Parent with copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its
staff or any other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary stated above, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or
the Schedule 13E-3 (including any amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or Schedule 13E-3) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, (a) the Company shall cooperate and provide the Parent with
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement
and responses relating thereto and shall consider in good faith and include
in such documents and responses comments reasonably proposed by the Parent
and (b) the Company and the Parent shall cooperate and provide each other
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 13E-3 and
responses relating thereto and shall consider in good faith comments
reasonably proposed by the other party. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all documents that it is responsible for filing
with the SEC or other regulatory authorities under this Section 4.4 to comply
with all applicable Legal Requirements. Whenever any event occurs which
is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, the Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, shall promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in
filing with the SEC or its staff or any other government officials, and/or
mailing to stockholders of the Company, such amendment or supplement. 

  

 4.5 Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 (a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all applicable Legal Requirements to call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of Company Common Stock to vote on the adoption and approval of this Agreement (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_"). The Company Stockholders Meeting shall be held (on a date selected by the Company in consultation with Parent) as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof. The Company shall ensure that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements. 

   

 (b) Subject to Section 4.5(c): (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors unanimously (with two abstentions) recommends, based on the recommendation of the Special Committee, that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt and approve this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting (such recommendation of the Board of Directors that the Companys stockholders vote to adopt and approve this Agreement being referred to as the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "); and (ii) the Company Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent, and no resolution by the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof to withdraw or 

    ##### 

  

    

modify the Company Board Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent shall
be adopted or proposed; _provided, however_ , that nothing herein
shall prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company
Stockholders Meeting if (1) there are holders of insufficient shares of the
Company Common Stock present or represented by a proxy at the Company
Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders
Meeting, (2) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting by applicable Legal Requirement or a request from the
SEC or its staff, or (3) the Board of Directors or the Special
Committee shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that it is necessary or appropriate to postpone or
adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting, including in order to give Company
Stockholders sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure
that the Company has sent to Company Stockholders or otherwise made available
to Company Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the
SEC or otherwise (including in connection with any withdrawal or modification
of the Company Board Recommendation). The Proxy Statement shall include the
opinion of the Financial Advisor referred to in Section 2.29. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.5(b), at any time prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by the Required Stockholder Vote, the Company Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent if: 

   

 (i) (1) an unsolicited, bona fide written offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is made to the Company and is not withdrawn; (2) such unsolicited, bona fide, written offer was not obtained or made as a direct or indirect result of a breach of this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or any "standstill" or similar agreement under which any Acquired Corporation has any rights or obligations; (3) the Companys Board of Directors or the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after consulting with its independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) that such offer constitutes a Superior Offer; (4) the Company has provided Parent with notice of such offer and the determination of the Companys Board of Directors or the Special Committee, and for a period of two business days after the date of such notice, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation as a result of such offer; (5) the Companys Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consulting with its independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent) that such offer continues to constitute a Superior Offer; (6) the Companys Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that, the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; and (7) the Company Board Recommendation is not withdrawn or modified in a manner adverse to Parent at any time prior to the time at which Parent receives written notice from the Company confirming that the Companys Board of Directors has determined that such offer is a Superior Offer; or 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) in response to a material development or change in material circumstances occurring or arising after the date hereof, the existence of which was not known by the Board of Directors at or prior to the date hereof (and not relating to any Acquisition Proposal) (such material development or change in circumstances, an " _Intervening Event_ "), if the Board of Directors or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Intervening Event, that the withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation is required in order for the Board of Directors to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the Company Stockholders under applicable Legal Requirements; _provided, that_ , the Company Board of Directors shall not be entitled to exercise its right to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation pursuant to this sentence unless the Company has (1) provided to Parent at least three days prior notice (unless the Intervening Event arises fewer than three days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting in which case such notice shall be given as promptly as practicable) advising Parent that the Board of Directors or Special Committee intends to take such action and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail and (2) during such three day period, if requested by Parent, the Company engages in good faith negotiations with Parent to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need to withdraw or modify the Company Board Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event. 

  

 (d) The Companys obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 4.5(a) shall not be limited or otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior Offer or other Acquisition Proposal, or by any withdrawal or modification of the Company Board Recommendation. 

   

 (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company, the Special Committee or the Board of Directors from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Legal Requirements with regard to any Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders); or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (and any communication of the type described in this subsection (e) shall not be a "Triggering Event" for purposes of this Agreement).

Each party shall use reasonable best efforts to file or otherwise submit, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by such party with or otherwise submitted by such party to any Governmental Body with respect to the Merger and the other Contemplated Transactions, and to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such Governmental Body. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file any notification or other document required to be filed in connection with the Merger under any applicable foreign Legal Requirement relating to antitrust or competition matters. The Company and Parent shall respond as promptly as 

   ##### 

  

    

practicable to: (i) any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade
Commission or the Department of Justice for additional information or
documentation; and (ii) any inquiries or requests received from any state
attorney general, foreign antitrust or competition authority or other
Governmental Body in connection with antitrust or competition matters. At the
request of Parent, the Company shall agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any other action with respect to
any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the Acquired Corporations,
provided that any such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger.. 

  

 5.2 Employee Benefits. 

  

 (a) All employees of the Acquired Corporations who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") shall become employees of the Surviving Corporation. Nothing in this Section 5.2(a) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any Company Associate to employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, and the employment of each Continuing Employee shall be "at will" employment. Except for Indemnified Persons (as defined in Section 5.3(a)) to the extent of their respective rights pursuant to Section 5.3, no Company Associate or Continuing Employee shall be deemed to be a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) If requested by Parent prior to the Closing, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day prior to the date on which the Merger becomes effective, any Company Benefit Plan that contains a cash or deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company 401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing Date written evidence of the adoption by the Companys board of directors of resolutions authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). If requested, the Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company 401(k) Plan as Parent may reasonably request. 

   

 5.3 Indemnification of Officers and Directors. 

  

 (a) All rights to indemnification by any of the Acquired Corporations existing in favor of each individual who is an officer or director of any Acquired Corporation as of the date of this Agreement (each such individual, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") for his acts and omissions as a director or officer of the Company or any Acquired Corporation occurring prior to the Effective Time, as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or other similar organizational documents) (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) and as provided in the Indemnification Contract between the Acquired Corporation and such Indemnified Person (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) in the form disclosed to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect (to the fullest extent such rights to indemnification are available under and are consistent with Delaware law) for a period of six years from the date on which the Merger becomes effective, and Parent shall cause (and enable) the Surviving Corporation to perform its obligations thereunder. In addition, 

    ##### 

  

    

for a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to cause the certificate of incorporation (and
other organizational documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
exculpation of liability and advancement of expenses that are at least as
favorable as those provisions of the current certificate of incorporation (or
other organizational documents) of the Acquired Corporations. 

   

 (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Merger becomes effective, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, for the benefit of the Indemnified Persons with respect to their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the Effective Time, the Existing DandO Policies, to the extent that directors and officers liability insurance coverage is available on commercially reasonable terms; _provided, however,_ that: (i) the Surviving Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policies a policy or policies of comparable coverage; and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policies (or for any substitute policies) that exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to $300,000 (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In the event any future annual premiums for the Existing DandO Policies (or any substitute policies) exceed the Maximum Premium in the aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policies (or any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to the Maximum Premium _._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" pre-paid policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") on the Existing DandO Policies which Tail Policy shall be (1) on terms and conditions with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the Existing DandO Policies, (2) be for an amount not to exceed the Maximum Premium and (3) name Parent as a successor in interest of such Tail Policy. In the event the Company purchases such Tail Policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their obligations thereunder in lieu of all other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section 5.3(b). 

   

 5.4 Additional Agreements. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement (including Section 5.4(b) below), Parent and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be taken all actions necessary to consummate the Merger and make effective the other Contemplated Transactions.

The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of each proposed filing with or other submission to any Governmental Body relating to any of the Contemplated Transactions, and shall give Parent a reasonable time prior to making such filing or other submission in which to review and comment 

    ##### 

  

    

on such proposed filing or other submission. The Company shall promptly
deliver to Parent a copy of each such filing or other submission made,
each notice given and each Consent obtained by the Company during the Pre-
Closing Period. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent shall not have any obligation under this Agreement: (i) to dispose of or transfer or cause any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer any assets, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to dispose of or transfer any assets; (ii) to discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any product or service, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to discontinue offering any product or service; (iii) to license or otherwise make available, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right, or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to license or otherwise make available to any Person any technology, software or other Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right; (iv) to hold separate or cause any of its Subsidiaries to hold separate any assets or operations (either before or after the Closing Date), or to commit to cause any of the Acquired Corporations to hold separate any assets or operations; or (v) to make or cause any of its Subsidiaries to make any commitment (to any Governmental Body or otherwise) regarding its future operations or the future operations of any of the Acquired Corporations. 

   

 (c) With respect to the Contract identified on Schedule 5.4, the Company will enter into an amendment thereto, or will otherwise take such actions as are necessary, so that (i) the last payment thereunder in respect of the services performed thereunder shall not be due at any time earlier than February 28, 2011; and (ii) if the Contract is terminated prior to any services being performed, then any amounts paid by the Company in advance under such Contract shall be refunded in full. 

   

 5.5 Disclosure. Parent and the Company will reasonably consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Company will issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior written consent of the other party, except to the extent that the disclosing party determines in good faith it is required to do so by applicable Legal Requirements or the rules or regulations of the NYSE Amex, in which case that party consult with the other party and will consider the other partys comments in good faith, and unless the Board of Directors (or Special Committee) believes in good faith that such comments are inappropriate, will implement them, before issuing any such release or making any such public statement. 

  

 5.6 Stockholder Litigation. To the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, in the event that any stockholder litigation relating to the Contemplated Transactions is brought or threatened against the Company or any members of the Companys Board prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent and keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or any members of the Company Board relating to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, at Parents cost. The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to 

   ##### 

  

 

enter into such joint defense agreement with Parent, if requested by Parent.
The Company shall not agree to any settlement of any stockholder
litigation for an amount in excess of $250,000 in the aggregate without
Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed). 

   

 5.7 Export Control. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions set forth on Part 5.7 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. With respect to the foregoing, the Company shall (x) promptly notify Parent of any material communication between the Company or its Affiliates and any Governmental Authority; (y) consult with Parent in advance of any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, give Parent or Parents Affiliates or Representatives, the opportunity to attend and participate thereat; and (z) subject to applicable Legal Requirements, furnish Parent or Parents Representatives with copies of written correspondence and communications between the Company and/or its Affiliates and/or its Representatives on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of their respective staffs on the other hand, including providing Parent or Parents Representative with the opportunity to review such material communications in advance of their submission.

 (b) No party shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. 

   

 9.3 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger. 

  

 9.4 Entire Agreement; Counterparts; Exchanges by Facsimile.

This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. 

  

 9.5 Applicable Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws. In any action or suit between any of the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement: (a) each of the parties irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in the State of Delaware; and (b) each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by jury. 

  

 9.6 Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, but subject to Section 9.7, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 9.7 Specific Performance. 

  

 (a) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the parties will be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. Each party to this Agreement, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, hereby waives any defenses it may have to the remedy of specific performance provided 

    ##### 

  

    

for herein, waives any requirement for the posting of any bond or other
security as a prerequisite for specific performance, and agrees not to raise
any objections to the remedy of specific performance in any proceeding
brought by any other party to this Agreement. The Company hereby agrees that
specific performance shall be its (and any third party beneficiarys) sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions, except as provided in Section 9.7(b) below and
as expressly provided in the Guarantee (if and to the extent applicable), and
subject to Section 9.7(b) below, that none of the Company nor any holder of
Company Common Stock may accept any other form of relief that may be
available for breach under this Agreement, the Guarantee, any
commitment letter (or similar document) or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary
damages). 

   

 (b) Only if a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent or Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement, the Company may enforce any award of damages granted by such court for such alleged breach against Parent, Merger Sub or such other Person and accept damages for such alleged breach only if, within two (2) weeks following such courts determination, Parent and Merger Sub do not consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, in no event shall the collective damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates, for breaches under this Agreement or the Guarantee exceed the Cap (as defined in the Guarantee) in the aggregate for all such breaches. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and any third party beneficiary may contemporaneously seek both specific performance and any other form of alternative relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions (including monetary damages), but no such alternative relief may be accepted unless and until the court has declined to award specific performance. The Company agrees to cause any pending Legal Proceeding seeking any such other relief to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement. The Company, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement and the Guarantee, covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the Sponsors shall have any obligation hereunder or thereunder and that no recourse or right of recovery hereunder or thereunder or under any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation, against, and no liability shall be attached to, any former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, stockholder, other equity holder, controlling person or assignee of a Sponsor or any Affiliate thereof or any former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, stockholder, other equity holder, controlling person or assignee of any of the foregoing (excluding Parent and Merger Sub), through Parent, Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against any of the foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any Legal Requirement, or otherwise. 

    ##### 

  

     

 9.8 Disclosure Schedules.

 SECTION 8. _Continuing Guarantee; Termination_. 

  

 (a) _Continuing Guarantee_. Except as set forth in Section 8(b), this Guarantee may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on the Guarantor, its successors and assigns until the payment or satisfaction in full of the Obligation. 

  

 (b) _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this Guarantee shall terminate and be of no further force or effect with respect to each Guarantor as of the earliest of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (other than any such termination that would not have occurred but for the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to fulfill its or their obligations under the Merger Agreement). 

  

 SECTION 9. _No Recourse_. The Company covenants, agrees and acknowledges that the sole asset (other than cash in a de minimus amount) of Parent is ownership of the capital stock of Merger Sub and that Merger Sub has no assets, and that no additional funds are expected to be paid, lent or contributed to Parent or Merger Sub unless and until the Closing occurs. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this Guarantee or any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith and that, notwithstanding the fact that the Guarantors are limited partnerships, the Company, by its acceptance of the benefits hereof, covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the Guarantors shall have any obligation hereunder and that no recourse or right of recovery hereunder or under any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation, against, and no liability shall be attached to, any Guarantor Non- Recourse Party, through Parent, Merger Sub or otherwise, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub against any Guarantor Non-Recourse Party, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any Legal Requirement, or otherwise. 

  

 SECTION 10. _Enforcement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, nothing in this Guarantee shall prevent the Company from seeking to enforce the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms or any related agreement including the Confidentiality Agreement against Parent or Merger Sub including any permitted assignee or successor to any of them. 

  

 SECTION 11. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Service of Process_. 

  

 (a) This Guarantee, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Guarantee or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Guarantee (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Guarantee or as 

   ##### 

  

    

an inducement to enter into this Guarantee) shall be governed by, and
construed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State
of New York, without regard to conflict of laws principles. 

  

 (b) Any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate courts therefrom within the State of Delaware (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each party hereto hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Delaware (or if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in respect of any legal action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee and (ii) waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such action, suit or proceeding, any claim that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such courts, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the action, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the action, suit or proceeding is improper or that this Guarantee or the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. 

  

 (c) Each party hereto agrees that notice or the service of process in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guarantee shall be properly served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by Section 7. 

  

 SECTION 12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with this Guarantee or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 SECTION 13. _Reformation_. If any term or other provision of this Guarantee is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other terms, provisions and conditions of this Guarantee shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. No party hereto shall assert, and each party shall cause its respective Affiliates not to assert, that this Guarantee or any part hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Guarantee so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 

  

 SECTION 14. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Guarantee constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. No amendment, modification or waiver of any provision hereof shall be enforceable unless approved by the Company and the Guarantor in writing.

 SECTION 16. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing set forth in this Guarantee shall be construed to confer upon or give to any Person other than the Company any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Guarantee or to confer upon or give to any Person any rights or remedies against any Person other than the Guarantor under or by reason of this Guarantee. 

  

 SECTION 17. _Counterparts_. The exchange of a fully executed Guarantee (in counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Guarantee.
