other Governmental Body, nor is any such audit, investigation or other Legal Proceeding pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. None of the Acquired Corporations nor any Company

to breaches by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions, except as provided in Section&nbsp;9.7(b) below and as
expressly provided in the Guarantee (if and to the extent applicable), and subject to Section
9.7(b) below, that none of the Company nor any holder of Company Common Stock may accept any other
form of relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement, the Guarantee, any commitment

enforce any award of damages granted by such court for such alleged breach against Parent, Merger
Sub or such other Person and accept damages for such alleged breach only if, within two (2)&nbsp;weeks
following such court&#146;s determination, Parent and Merger Sub do not consummate the Merger in
accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything else contained in this Agreement, in no
event shall the collective damages payable by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates, for
breaches under this Agreement or the Guarantee exceed the Cap (as defined in the Guarantee) in the
aggregate for all such breaches. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company and any third party
beneficiary may contemporaneously seek both specific performance and any other form of alternative
relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions (including monetary damages), but no such alternative
relief may be accepted unless and until the court has declined to award specific performance. The
Company agrees to cause any pending Legal Proceeding seeking any such other relief to be dismissed
with prejudice at such time as Parent and Merger Sub consummate the Merger in accordance with this
Agreement. The Company, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement and the Guarantee,
covenants, agrees and acknowledges that no Person other than the Sponsors shall have any obligation
hereunder or thereunder and that no recourse or right of recovery hereunder or thereunder or under
any document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim based
