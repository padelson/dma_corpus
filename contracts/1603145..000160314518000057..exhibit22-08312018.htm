disputed items must be within the range of values assigned to each such item
in the applicable proposed list of the Working Capital Inputs as of the

notice of objection, respectively. The Neutral Auditor shall be directed to
determine such values (in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence)

3(e). All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by
the Neutral Auditor will be borne equally by Seller and Purchaser. The Neutral
Auditor shall be directed to resolve the disputed items and deliver to Seller
and Purchaser a written determination of the amounts for such disputed items
(such determination to be made consistent with this subparagraph 3(e), to
include all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and
to be based solely on information provided to the Neutral Auditor by Purchaser
and Seller) within thirty (30) days after being retained and such
determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties and their
respective Affiliates, representatives, successors and assigns.
Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, the dispute
resolution mechanism contained in this subparagraph 3(e) shall be the
exclusive mechanism for resolving disputes, if any, regarding the Working
Capital Inputs as of the Closing Date for purposes of revising the Portfolio
Project Model as set forth in subparagraph 3(f) below, if any, and neither
Seller nor Purchaser shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article

that are transferred to or assumed by Purchaser and that were included in the
calculation of the Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment. Within

Purchaser's list of Working Capital Inputs as of the Closing Date delivered
pursuant to subparagraph 3(b) or subparagraph 3(c) above, as the case may be,
as modified by the Neutral Auditor's determination of the amounts of the
specific disputed items; provided, that, if within such five (5) Business Day
period the representatives of the Parties have not met to revise the Portfolio
Project Model, then the representative of Seller shall revise and re-run the
Portfolio Project Model in accordance with subparagraph 3(f) below using the
applicable list of Working Capital Inputs as of the Closing Date as modified

the representatives of the Parties shall revise the Working Capital Inputs to

following the completion of the revisions described in clause (i) and the re-
run of the Portfolio Project Model, the Purchase Price shall be set forth in
cell "C14" in the worksheet labeled "Purchase Price Calculation" in the
Portfolio Project Model. 

Immediately upon completion of the revision of the Portfolio Project Model as
set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph 3(f), Seller
shall calculate the Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment (which
calculation shall, in the absence of manifest error, be binding on Seller and
Purchaser) and not later than one (1) Business Day after such calculation is
completed, notify Purchaser of the amount of the Post-Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Payment (which may be a positive or negative amount). If the Post-
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment is a positive amount, then
Purchaser shall pay in cash to Seller such positive amount. If the Post-
Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment is a negative amount, then Seller
shall pay in cash to Purchaser an amount equal to the absolute value of the
Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment. Any such payment in respect
of the Post-Closing Working Capital Adjustment Payment will be due and payable
within three (3) Business Days after the Seller gives notice to Purchaser of
