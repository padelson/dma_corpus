been satisfied (or, to the

  



  

2      
   



  

## extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the
benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all the conditions set forth
in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof), or at
such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent
and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time_ _._ Prior to the Closing, the parties
shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter

_Effective Time_ ").

  

## 

  

## SECTION 1.04. _Effects_ _._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in

Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

## 

  

### (b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

## 

  

## SECTION 1.07. _Officers_ _._ The officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving

# _ARTICLE II_

  

# _ _

  

# _ _Effect on the Capita__ _l Stock of the 
 Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_

  

# _ _

  

## SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_ _._ At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent- Owned Stock._ Each share
of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent, Sub or by any
of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries shall automatically be canceled
and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered
or deliverable in exchange therefor.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ (1) Subject to Sections
2.01(b) and 2.01(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock shall be converted into the right to receive $30.25 in cash.

  

### 

  

### (2) The cash payable upon the conversion of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(1) is referred to as the " _Merger_

  



  

4      
   



  

### _Consideration_ ". As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company
Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.03(c) upon surrender of such certificate in
accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

  



  

### (d) _Appraisal Rights._  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair market value of
such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262; _provided_ , _however_
, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then the right of
such holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares shall
cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of
the Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right
to receive, Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

  



  

5      
   



  

## SECTION 2.02. _Exchange of Certificates_ _._ (a) _Paying Agent._ As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of certificates
representing Company Common Stock. Parent will enter into a paying agent
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Prior
to or at the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited
with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders, cash in an aggregate amount necessary to pay for the shares of
Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  

## 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (i) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common
Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted
pursuant to Section 2.01 and certain dividends and other distributions in
respect of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.03, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to

  



  

6      
   



  

### a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable.  Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration, without interest, and certain dividends or other distributions
in accordance with Section 2.03(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon
surrender of any Certificate shall be deemed to have been paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock, _subject_ ,  _however_ , to the Surviving CorporationÂ’s obligation to
pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to
the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the
Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for
six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon
demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter

  



  

7      
   



  

### look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has not been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), any such cash, dividends or distributions in respect of
such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Parent may cause the Paying Agent
to invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a
daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent. In no case, however, shall any such investment or
any such payment of interest or income delay the receipt by holders of
Certificates of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holdersÂ’
rights hereunder.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with
respect thereto, without interest.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to

  



  

8      
   



  

### this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of
any supranational, national, federal, state, local or municipal (whether
domestic or foreign) tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent, as applicable.

Except as set forth (i) in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents filed or furnished by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") or (ii) in
the letter, dated the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent (the
" _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and warrants to

## SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing an_ _d Power._ Each of the Company
and each of its subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and
authority to conduct its businesses as presently conducted. The Company and
each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction
where the nature of its business or its ownership or leasing of its
properties make such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be
so qualified, individually or in the aggregate, has not had, and is
not reasonably likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the restated
certificate of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this
Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Charter_ "), and

  



  

9      
   



  

## the amended and restated bylaws of the Company, as amended to the date of
this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Company Bylaws_ "), and the comparable
charter and organizational documents of each Company Subsidiary, in each case
as amended through the date of this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent true and complete copies of the minutes of all meetings
of the stockholders of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, the board of
directors of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and the committees of
each of such board of directors, in each case held since January 1, 2001.

  

## 

  

## SECTION 3.02. _Company Subsidiaries; Equ_ _ity Interests._ (a) The Company
Disclosure Letter lists each Company Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of

## SECTION 3.04. _Authority; Execution and_ _ Delivery; Enforceability._ (a)
The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver each of the Transaction Agreements to which it is a party and to

  



  

13      
   



  

## consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.  Assuming the
representation made in Section 4.07 is correct, the execution and delivery by
the Company of each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, subject in the case of the Merger to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are or will be necessary to authorize the Transaction Agreements to
which it is a party or to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
The Company has duly executed and delivered each Transaction Agreement to
which it is a party, and each such Transaction Agreement constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms.  The board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_
"), at a meeting, duly called, and held duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, (ii) determining that the terms of the Merger, the Transaction
Agreements and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are
fair to and in the best interests of the CompanyÂ’s stockholders and (iii)
declaring the Agreement advisable, which resolutions have not been
subsequently rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way.  Assuming the
representation made in Section 4.07 is correct, the approval of this
Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the Company Board referred to
in this Section 3.04(a) constitutes approval of the Merger for purposes of
Section 203 of the DGCL and represents the only action necessary to ensure
that the restrictions on "business combinations" (as such term is defined
therein) set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL does not and will not apply to
the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Agreements and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.  To the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, no other state
takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies or purports to
apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby.

(b) Assuming the representation made in Section 4.07 is correct, the only
vote or consent of holders of any class or series of Company Capital Stock
necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Company
Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "). The execution and
delivery of the Principal Stockholder Consents will constitute the Company
Stockholder Approval. The affirmative vote or consent of the holders of
Company Capital Stock, or any of them, is not necessary to approve any
Transaction Agreement other than this Agreement or consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than the Merger.

53      
   



  

person or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to October 11, 2004, the Company Board may, in response to a bona fide
written Company Takeover Proposal that the Company Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead
to a Superior Proposal, and which Company Takeover Proposal did not result
from a breach of this Section 5.02, and subject to compliance with Section
5.02, (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and any Company
Subsidiary to the person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not less
restrictive as a whole of such person than the Confidentiality Agreement
(provided that all such information not previously provided to Parent is
provided or made available on a prior or substantially concurrent basis to
Parent) and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the person
making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding
such Company Takeover Proposal.  Without limiting the foregoing, it is
understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the preceding
sentence by any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any Representative of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by the Company.

  



  

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
recommend the approval or adoption of any Company Takeover Proposal, (B)
determine that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable, (C)
withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub) the approval of
this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (D) recommend that the
stockholders of the Company reject this Agreement, the other
Transaction Agreements, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or (E) resolve, agree or publicly propose to
take any such actions (each such action set forth in this Section 5.02(b)(i)
being referred to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), (ii)
adopt or approve any Company Takeover Proposal or resolve, agree or propose
to adopt or approve any Company Takeover Proposal, or (iii) cause or permit
the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of

  



  

54      
   



  

understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement
or other agreement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") constituting or
related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to, any
Company Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to
in Section 5.02(a)), or resolve, agree or propose to take any such actions.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to October 11, 2004, the
Company Board may (i) if the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to do so would
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company
under applicable Law, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) solely
in response to a Superior Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this Section 5.02, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f) and concurrently enter into a binding Acquisition Agreement
containing the terms of a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that (A) no
such termination of this Agreement by the Company may be made, in each case
until after the third business day following ParentÂ’s receipt of written
notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and specifying the terms
and conditions of, and the identity of any person making, the Superior
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new written notice by the Company and a new three business day period);
provided, however, that it is understood and agreed that the delivery of such
notice shall not, in and of itself, be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.01(f), and any purported termination pursuant to Section 8.01(f)
shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have
complied with all applicable requirements of Section 6.07(b) (including the
payment of the Termination Fee prior to or simultaneously with such
termination). In determining whether to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or to terminate this Agreement as described in this Section 5.02(b), the
Company Board shall take into account any changes to the financial and other
terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to any such written
notice by the Company or otherwise.

  



  

55      
   



  

(c) The Company promptly shall advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover Proposal, the identity
of the person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the
material terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall (i) keep Parent fully informed of the status including any change to
the terms of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide
to Parent as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with
copies of the Company Takeover Proposal (including any amendments or
supplements thereto) and all such other material information provided in
writing to the Company by the party making such Company Takeover Proposal.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any required
disclosure to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of
the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, failure so to
disclose would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or any other
obligations under applicable Law.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

  



  

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, recapitalization or other business combination
involving the Company, (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the Company of
over 20% of its equity securities as consideration for the assets or
securities of another person or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, over 20% of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company, in each case other than the Merger.

  



  

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer by a third party
that (i) if consummated would result in such third party (or in the case of a
direct merger between such third party and the Company, the stockholders of
such third party) acquiring, directly

  



  

56      
   



  

or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting power of the Company Common Stock
or all or substantially all the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, that the Company Board determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to have a higher value than the consideration to be
received by the CompanyÂ’s stockholders in connection with the Merger, taking
into account, among other things, any changes to the terms of this Agreement
offered by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or otherwise and (ii)
is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

condition or agreement to be

  



  

60

,  _however_ , that no such notification shall affect the

(e) The Company shall deliver to Parent at the Closing a duly executed and

(i)  provide that each vested and unexercised Company Stock Option (but
not any purchase right under the ESPP) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive an amount of cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger
Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (2) the exercise price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option,
multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Stock Option shall not theretofore have been exercised, which amount
shall be paid as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, without
interest;

  



  

61      
   



  

(ii)  provide that, with repsect to those individuals listed in
Section 6.04(a)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each unvested Company
Stock Option (but not any purchase right under the ESPP) outstanding

of cash (each, an " _Unvested Option Cashout Amount_ ") equal to (A) the
excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common
Stock over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject
to such Unvested Option, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such portion of such Unvested Option, without
interest; provided, however, that a holder of an Unvested Option shall
receive the applicable Unvested Option Cashout Amount only if such holder
remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates
through the applicable Payment Date; provided, further, that if such holderÂ’s
employment with the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates is
terminated by the Surviving Corporation or one of its affiliates other than
for "Cause" or by such holder for "Good Reason" or by reason of such holderÂ’s
death or "Disability" (each as defined in Section 6.04(a)(ii) of the Company
Disclosure Letter), any remaining unpaid Unvested Option Cashout Amount shall
be paid as soon as practicable following such termination of employment,
without interest, and, for purposes of this Section 6.04(a)(ii), the "

62      
   



  

Closing Date, the Payment Date shall be the twelve-month anniversary of the

Option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be, at the
Effective Time, vested and converted into the right to receive an amount of
cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration per
share of Company Common Stock over (2) the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Option, multiplied by (B) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Unvested Option shall
not theretofore have been exercised, which amount shall be paid as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, without interest;

  



  

(iv) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plan as the Company and
Parent may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger and the terms
of this Agreement.

at the Effective Time in exchange for a lump sum cash payment equal to (i)
the excess of (A) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock
over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Warrant, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for
which such Warrant shall not theretofore have been exercised.

  



  

63      
   



  

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (if any),
including amending the ESPP, as may be required to provide that (i) no new
offering period under the ESPP shall be commenced on or after the date of
this Agreement, (ii) no additional participants shall be permitted to
participate in the ESPP during the offering period in effect as of the date
of this Agreement and no ESPP participant shall be permitted to increase his
or her rate of contributions under the ESPP, (iii) any offering period under
the ESPP in effect as of the date of this Agreement that is still outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall terminate immediately prior to
the Effective Time and the purchase rights of each participant thereunder
shall be canceled, with each such participant becoming entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
product of (x) the maximum number of whole shares of Company Common Stock
that such participant could have purchased at such time with such
participantÂ’s then-accumulated payroll contributions under the ESPP based on
the purchase price per share of Company Common Stock applicable under such
offering period determined pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, multiplied by
(y) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock and (B)
the portion, if any, of such participantÂ’s then-accumulated payroll
contributions under the ESPP that would remain following the purchase of
whole shares pursuant to clause (A) and (iv) the ESPP shall terminate

a Warrant or Company Stock Option (or former holder of a Warrant or Company
Stock Option) or any participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire
any capital stock of the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any other
equity interest therein (including "phantom" stock or stock appreciation
rights).

  



  

SECTION 6.05. _Employee Matters._ (a)  Through December 31, 2005, the
employees of the Company who remain

  



  

64      
   



  

in the employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") shall receive base salary, incentive opportunities
(other than equity-based compensation), welfare benefits and pension benefits
that in the aggregate are substantially comparable to such benefits provided
under the CompanyÂ’s employee benefit plans, policies or arrangements to such
employees immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that neither
Parent nor the Surviving Corporation nor any Company Subsidiary shall have
any obligation to issue, or adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the
issuance of (A) any shares of Company Capital Stock or other voting
securities or equity interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (B)
any securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Capital Stock or other
voting securities or equity interests of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or (C) any Company Stock Based Awards, warrants, calls, options or
other rights to acquire from the Company or any Company Subsidiary or that
give any person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to
or derived from the economic benefits and rights occurring to holders of
Company Capital Stock; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that no plans or
arrangements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary providing for such
issuance shall be taken into account in determining whether employee benefits
are substantially comparable in the aggregate. With respect to equity-
based compensation, Continuing Employees shall be treated by Parent in
substantially the same manner as it treats other similarly situated peer
employees.

  



  

(b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the Company
shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans or to continue the
employment of any specific person.

  



  

(c) Parent shall grant all Continuing Employees credit for all service with
the Company and its affiliates and their respective predecessors prior to the
Closing Date for all purposes for which such service was recognized by the
Company and its affiliates, including eligibility, vesting and benefit
accrual purposes (other than benefit accrual purposes under defined benefit
pension plans) under all health, disability, vacation, severance and pension

  



  

65      
   



  

plans (other than post-employment health and post-employment life insurance
plans) that are made available by Parent for the benefit of the Continuing
Employees, except to the extent such credit would result in duplication of
benefits; provided, however, that Parent shall have no obligation to provide
to any Continuing Employee the opportunity to participate in any defined
benefit pension plan or post-employment health and post-employment life
insurance plan.

  



  

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate after the Effective Time, Parent and
its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) waive, or cause to be waived, all limitations as to
preexisting conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions and exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees
under the welfare plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying
any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent
applicable under any such plan.

  



  

(e) Parent shall cause the Company to honor the terms of CompanyÂ’s 2004 Short
Term Incentive Plan in effect on the date of this Agreement (as previously
disclosed to Parent) (the " _STIP_ "), and shall pay all amounts actually
earned under the terms of the STIP (based on actual performance for the full
2004 calendar year as substantiated to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent)
in the first quarter of 2005. Parent agrees that it shall not terminate
or amend the STIP following the Effective Time in a manner that would
adversely affect the awards that may be earned by individuals who are
participants in the STIP immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

SECTION 6.06. _Indemnification._ (a)  Parent shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all the CompanyÂ’s
obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for
expenses) the current or former directors

  



  

66      
   



  

or officers of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") for acts or
omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective
Time to the extent that such obligations of the Company exist on the date of
this Agreement, whether pursuant to the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws,
individual indemnity agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with the terms of the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, and
such individual indemnity agreements from the Effective Time until the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any
claims against such directors or officers arising out of such acts or
omissions.

  



  

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the current policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’
liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers of
at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 300% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance
(such 300% amount, the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage
cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most advantageous
policies of directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ insurance obtainable for an annual
premium equal to the Maximum Premium.  The Company represents to Parent that
the Maximum Premium is $2,400,000.

  



  

(c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving

  



  

67      
   



  

Corporation or Parent shall assume the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case may be, set forth in this
Section 6.06.

  



  

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneyÂ’s
fees, incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.06.

  



  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have
under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, any indemnification agreement or
the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 6.06 shall survive the
consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Parties.

  



  

SECTION 6.07. _Fees and Expenses_. (a)  Except as may be otherwise expressly
provided for in this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Merger and the other Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
except that (a) the Company and Parent shall divide equally the costs
incurred in connection with the printing and mailing of the Information
Statement, unless the Company enters into an Acquisition Agreement
constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely
to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal, in which case the Company shall
pay all such costs, and (b) Parent shall pay all costs incurred in connection
with the preparation, printing and mailing of all materials relating to the
debt tender.

  



  

(b) In the event that (i) (A) a Company Takeover Proposal has been made to
the Company or its stockholders or a Company Takeover Proposal shall have
otherwise become publicly known, (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated
by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), and (C)
within 12 months after such termination, the Company or any of its
subsidiaries enters into any Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or

(b) by either Parent or the Company:

  



  

(i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before January 31, 2005 (the "
_Outside Date_ "), unless the failure to consummate the Merger is the result

(ii)  if any Governmental Entity issues an order, decree or ruling or

(c) by Parent, if an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred;

  



  

(d) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in any
Transaction Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b), and
(ii) cannot be or has not been cured by the Outside Date; provided

  



  

74      
   



  

that Parent has given 30 days written notice to the Company of such breach;
and provided further that Parent is not then in wilful and material breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in any
Transaction Agreement;

  



  

(e) by the Company, if Parent or Sub breaches or fails to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Sub or the Company, other
than Section 3.20, Section 4.06, the last sentence of Section 6.02, Section
6.07, Section 6.08, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall
survive such termination, and except to the extent that such termination
results from the wilful and material breach by a party of any representation,
warranty or covenant set forth in any Transaction Agreement.

  



  

SECTION 8.03. _Amendment._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties at

a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.  The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

  



  

SECTION 8.05. _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver._ A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant

any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

  



  

SECTION 9.06. _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same

Transaction Agreements, taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Confidentiality Agreement, (a) constitute the entire agreement, and

  



  

80      
   



  

supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and by
the other Transaction Agreements and (b) except for Sections 6.04 and 6.06,

SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in

without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Sub may

obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Sub
of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void.  Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  



  

SECTION 9.10. _Enforcement._ The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of any Transaction Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any Transaction Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of each Transaction
Agreement in any New York state court, any Federal court located in the State
of New York or the State of Delaware or in any Delaware state court, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at

  



  

81      
   



  

Law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any New York state court, any
Federal court located in the State of New York or the State of Delaware or

Transaction Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that
it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (c) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to any Transaction Agreement or any transaction

Federal court sitting in the State of New York or the State of Delaware or

respect to any action related to or arising out of any Transaction Agreement
or any transaction contemplated hereby.

  



  

SECTION 9.11. _Disclosure Letter._ Any matter disclosed in any section of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosed for all purposes and
all sections of the Company Disclosure Letter, to the extent it is readily
apparent from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure is applicable
to such other sections; provided, however, that such disclosure shall not be
deemed an admission or representation as to the materiality of the item
disclosed.

  



  

82      
   



  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have duly executed
this Agreement, all as of the date first written above.
