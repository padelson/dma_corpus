NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



1 ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.01 _The_ _Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Connecticut Business
Corporation Act (the " _CBCA_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into CTWS (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and CTWS shall
continue as the surviving entity in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_
").

Section 1.02  _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, 525
University Avenue, Palo Alto, California, 94301 at 7:00 a.m., Pacific time, on
a date to be specified by SJW and CTWS, which shall be no later than the
third Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by
Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the
conditions set forth in  _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions),
or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed in writing between SJW
and CTWS. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".

 

Section 1.03 _Effective_ _Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall (i) file with
the Secretary of the State of the State of Connecticut a certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the CBCA, and (ii)
as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date, make all other filings
required under the CBCA or by the Secretary of the State of the State of
Connecticut in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Secretary of the State of the State of Connecticut, or at such later time as
SJW and CTWS shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the CBCA (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the CBCA. 

Section 1.05 _Certificate_ _of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of
incorporation of CTWS, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The
bylaws of CTWS, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be determined in accordance
with _Exhibit_ __ _ A_.

 



2 ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES;_

 

 _EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of SJW, Merger Sub, CTWS or any
holder of any of the following securities:

(a) _Conversion of CTWS Common Stock_. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_,
each share of common stock, without par value, of CTWS (" _CTWS Common Stock_
", and such shares, " _CTWS Common Shares_ "), other than any Cancelled CTWS
Common Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive
that number of fully paid and nonassessable common shares, par value $0.001
per share, of SJW (the " _SJW Common Shares_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All such CTWS Common Shares, when so
converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such CTWS Common Shares (each such
certificate, a " _Certificate_ ") or CTWS Common Shares held in direct
registration form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SJW Common Shares to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or other distributions to
which holders become entitled in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, in
each case, without interest. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Exchange
Ratio_ " means 1.1375. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding SJW Common Shares or
CTWS Common Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares
or a different class, by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization,
split, reverse split, combination, consolidation, subdivision,
reclassification or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained herein that is based upon
the number of SJW Common Shares or CTWS Common Shares, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to SJW and the holders of CTWS
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event;  _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not be
construed to permit SJW or CTWS to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by _Section_ __ _ 5.01(a)_ or _5.01(b)_ , as
applicable. As provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.02(j)_, the right of any holder
of CTWS Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration or other
consideration shall be reduced by the amount of any withholding under
applicable Tax Law.

 

(b) _Cancelled CTWS Common Shares_. Each CTWS Common Share that is owned
directly or indirectly by SJW or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time or held directly or
indirectly by CTWS or any CTWS Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective
Time (in each case, other than any CTWS Common Share held on behalf of third
parties) (the " _Cancelled CTWS Common Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

 



3 (c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing
the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent
the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which
they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, SJW shall appoint a bank or
trust company with the prior approval of CTWS (not to be unreasonably
withheld) to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment
of the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective Time, SJW shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the former holders of
CTWS Common Stock entitled to receive Merger Consideration under _Section_ __
_ 2.01(a)_, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through the
Exchange Agent, (i) a sufficient number of SJW Common Shares (whether
represented in certificated or non-certificated direct registration form) to
issue the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) cash sufficient to make
payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_.
From time to time as needed, SJW shall deposit with the Exchange Agent cash
sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions which former holders of
CTWS Common Stock have the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.02(d)_. All such cash and SJW Common Shares deposited with the Exchange
Agent is hereinafter referred to collectively as the " _Exchange Fund_."

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, and in any event not later than the second Business Day thereafter, SJW
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of CTWS Common
Stock a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such
customary form and have such other customary provisions as SJW may specify
subject to CTWSs reasonable approval, together with instructions thereto.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_.

(i) After the Effective Time, upon the surrender of a Certificate for
cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with the Letter of Transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (A) the Merger Consideration into which the CTWS Common
Shares previously represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.02(f)_ and in respect of any dividends or other distributions which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(d)_. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of CTWS Common Stock that is not registered
in the transfer records of CTWS, the

 



4  proper number of SJW Common Shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and
cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_ and in respect of any dividends or
other distributions which the holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(d)_ may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate
(or, for Book-Entry Shares, proper evidence of such transfer) representing
such CTWS Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer, including
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration which the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares were
entitled to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ (and cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_ and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(d)_). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable under this 
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_ or under _Section_ __ _ 2.02(d)_, _2.02(e)_ or
_2.02(f)_.

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent shall deliver to each former holder of Book-Entry Shares (A) the Merger
Consideration into which such CTWS Common Shares have been converted pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ and (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.02(f)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no
former record holder of a Book-Entry Share shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the Exchange Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Book-Entry Shares. In lieu
thereof, such former record holder shall, upon receipt by the Exchange Agent
of an "agents message" in customary form (or such other evidence, if any, as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive, and SJW
shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event not later than the
third Business Day thereafter), the Merger Consideration in respect of each
Book-Entry Share of such former holder, and such Book-Entry Shares shall
forthwith be cancelled. The SJW Common Shares deliverable to any holder under
this _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c_ _)(_ _ii)_ shall be deemed issued to such holder
on the Closing Date.

 

(d) _Treatment of_ _Unexchanged_ _Shares_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to SJW Common Shares with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the SJW Common Shares issuable
upon surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares
shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_, until
the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this
_Article II_. Subject to abandoned property, escheat, Tax or other applicable
Law, following surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there
shall be paid to the holder of the SJW Common Shares issued in exchange
therefor (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash payable
in lieu of a fractional SJW Common Share to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_ and the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time previously paid with
respect to such whole shares of SJW Common Shares and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of SJW
Common Shares.

 



5 (e) _No Further Ownership Rights in CTWS Common Stock_. The SJW Common Shares
issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ upon
conversion of any CTWS Common Shares (including any cash paid pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(f)_) shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such CTWS Common Shares,
subject to SJWs obligation to pay any dividends or other distributions with a
record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by
CTWS on such CTWS Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. From and after the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of SJW of CTWS Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to the last sentence of
_Section_ __ _ 2.02(h)_, if, after the Effective Time, any Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are presented for transfer to the Surviving Corporation,
SJW or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged
as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional SJW Common Shares shall be issued
upon the conversion of CTWS Common Stock pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)_, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a holder of SJW Common Shares.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
CTWS Common Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have
been entitled to receive a fraction of a SJW Common Share (after taking into
account all Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash in an amount equal to (i) such
fractional amount, multiplied by (ii) the average of the volume weighted
average price per SJW Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ")
(as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. or, if not reported by Bloomberg, L.P., in
another authoritative source mutually selected by SJW and CTWS) on each of the
five consecutive trading days ending with the last complete trading day prior
to the Closing Date (the " _SJW Common Share Closing VWAP_ ").

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of CTWS Common Stock for six months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to SJW, upon demand, and any former
holder of CTWS Common Stock who has not previously complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to SJW for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends
and other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

(h) _No Liability_. None of SJW, CTWS, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Exchange Fund delivered to any Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates immediately prior
to the date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or become
the property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of SJW, free and clear of all claims or
interests of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund as reasonably
directed by SJW. Any interest

 



6 and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to SJW.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that there are any losses with
respect to such investments or for any other reason any amount in the Exchange
Fund is below that required to make prompt payment of the payments
contemplated by this _Article II_ , SJW shall promptly replace, restore or
supplement the SJW Common Shares or cash, as applicable, in the Exchange Fund
so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payments contemplated by this
_Article II_.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of SJW, Merger Sub, CTWS and the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts required to be
deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made.

 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by SJW, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and
customary amount as SJW may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section_ __
_ 2.02(h)_, SJW) shall deliver and pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any other cash deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_.

 

Section 2.03 _Termination of CTWS Dividend Reinvestment Plan_. If requested in
writing by SJW, CTWS shall take such action as may be necessary to cause
CTWSs Third Amended and Restated Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock
Purchase Plan (the " _CTWS Dividend Reinvestment Plan_ ") to be terminated
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the
CTWS Dividend Reinvestment Plan; _provided_ , that the termination of the CTWS
Dividend Reinvestment Plan will not have any effect on the CTWS Common Shares
credited to the account of a participant in the CTWS Dividend
Reinvestment Plan at the time of such termination or the right of such CTWS
Common Shares to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.01(a)_.

date of this Agreement (the " _Filed SJW Reporting Documents_ ") (excluding
any disclosures (A) in any risk factors section, (B) in any "Forward-Looking

Documents) or (ii) as set forth in the disclosure letter delivered by SJW to
CTWS prior to the execution and 

 



7  delivery by SJW of this Agreement (the " _SJW Disclosure Letter_ "). The SJW

(a) The execution and delivery by SJW of this Agreement does not, and the
performance by SJW of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,

(a) SJW has furnished or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents (including exhibits and other information incorporated

12 furnished or filed by SJW with the SEC since January 1, 2015 (such documents,

furnished (or if amended or superseded by a filing or amendment prior to the
date of this Agreement, then at the time of such filing or amendment) contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Each of the consolidated financial statements of SJW included
in the SJW Reporting Documents complied at the time it was filed as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the

as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the SJW Reporting Documents, and
the statements contained in such certifications are true and correct. For
purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive officer" and "principal
financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX.
Neither SJW nor any SJW Subsidiary has outstanding, or has arranged any
outstanding, "extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within

designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the asset of SJW, (ii)

effect on its financial statements.

to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by SJW in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such
information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to the
management of SJW, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to enable the principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of SJW to make the certifications required under
the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(g) Since January 1, 2016, none of SJW, SJWs independent accountants, the
SJW Board or the audit committee of the SJW Board has received any oral or
written notification of any (i) "significant deficiency" in the internal
controls over financial reporting of SJW that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect SJWs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal controls over
financial reporting of SJW or (iii) fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees of SJW who have a significant role in
the internal controls over financial reporting of SJW. For purposes of this

have the meanings assigned to them in Auditing Standard No. 5 of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

Letter (the " _Regulated SJW Subsidiaries_ ") are regulated as a "water
corporation" and a "public utility" within California and a "water and sewer
utility" and "retail public utility" in Texas. All assets included in the rate
base calculations of the Regulated SJW Subsidiaries (i) in California, to the
extent any portion of such facilities were eliminated from consideration
within the meaning of Section 455.5 of the California Public Utilities Code,
for rate setting purposes, have been "returned to useful service" and such
facilities value and associated expenses are currently considered for
purposes of establishment of the Regulated SJW Subsidiarys rates and (ii) in

of the Regulated SJW Subsidiaries are currently disallowed from recovery in
rates based on its value and associated expenses in any ratemaking procedure
before the California Public Utilities Commission (the " _CPUC_ ") or the
Public Utilities Commission of Texas (the " _PUCT_ "), as applicable.

 

(b) Since January 1, 2015, SJW and each SJW Subsidiary has filed with the SEC
or the appropriate state public utilities commission (including the CPUC and
the PUCT), as the case may be, all documents required to be filed by it under
applicable state public utility Laws, except for filings the failure of which
to make would not reasonably be expected to have,

 



14 individually or in the aggregate, a SJW Material Adverse Effect. All such

Section 5.02 _No Solicitation by SJW; SJW Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or
the date of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with  _Article
VIII_ , except as expressly permitted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_,
SJW shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any
of its or their respective directors, officers or employees or any of their
respective investment bankers, accountants, attorneys or other advisors,
agents or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (i)
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage or knowingly
facilitate any SJW Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to a SJW Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or
indirectly participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
(other than SJWs Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any Person (other
than SJWs Representatives) any non-public information with respect to, any
SJW Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a SJW Takeover Proposal (other than to state that the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ prohibit any such discussions). SJW shall,
and shall cause its

 



55 Subsidiaries and direct its and their respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to any SJW
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a SJW Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished to any such Person or its
Representatives and immediately terminate all physical and electronic dataroom
access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the SJW Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written SJW
Takeover Proposal that the SJW Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and the SJW Financial Advisor or another
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior SJW Proposal, and that did not result
from a material breach of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_, SJW, and its
Representatives at the request of SJW, may, subject to compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.02(c)_, (x) furnish information with respect to SJW and the
SJW Subsidiaries to the Person making such SJW Takeover Proposal (and its
Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously been
provided to CTWS or is provided to CTWS prior to or substantially concurrent
with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement that, taken as a whole, is not materially less
restrictive of such Person than the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that
such confidentiality agreement shall not be required to contain standstill
provisions (a " _SJW Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and (y)
participate in discussions regarding the terms of such SJW Takeover Proposal
and the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such
SJW Takeover Proposal (and such Persons Representatives). Without limiting
the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ by any SJW Subsidiary or any of its or their
Representatives shall constitute a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(a)_ by
SJW.

(b) Except as set forth below, neither the SJW Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
CTWS), or propose publicly to withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner
adverse to CTWS), the SJW Recommendation or (B) adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose publicly to adopt, approve, recommend or declare
advisable, any SJW Takeover Proposal (any action in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _SJW Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or propose publicly to approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or allow SJW or any of its Affiliates to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or other
agreement or arrangement (each, an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") (other than a
SJW Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) constituting or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to any SJW Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the SJW Stockholder Approval,
the SJW Board may make a SJW Adverse Recommendation Change if the SJW Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel and the SJW
Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that SJW shall
not be entitled to exercise its right to make a SJW Adverse Recommendation
Change in connection with a SJW Takeover Proposal or a Superior SJW Proposal
until after 96 hours following CTWSs receipt of written notice (a " _SJW
Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from SJW advising CTWS that the SJW Board

 



56 intends to make a SJW Adverse Recommendation Change and specifying the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of any SJW Takeover Proposal or
Superior SJW Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action by the SJW
Board (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material term of such SJW Takeover Proposal or Superior
SJW Proposal shall require a new SJW Notice of Recommendation Change, except
that any subsequent notice period shall be reduced to 72 hours). In
determining whether to make a SJW Adverse Recommendation Change, the SJW
Board shall take into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by CTWS in response to a SJW Notice of Recommendation Change or
otherwise, and, if requested by CTWS, SJW and Merger Sub shall engage in good
faith negotiations with CTWS regarding any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by CTWS during the required notice period.

(c) In addition to the obligations of SJW set forth in _Sections 5.02(a)_ and
_5.02(b)_ , SJW shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours of receipt
thereof by SJW or any of its Affiliates or any of its or their
Representatives) advise CTWS in writing of any SJW Takeover Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to a SJW
Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such SJW Takeover
Proposal or inquiry or proposal (including any changes thereto) and
the identity of the Person making any such SJW Takeover Proposal or inquiry
or proposal. SJW shall (i) keep CTWS informed in all material respects on a
prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any SJW Takeover Proposal and
(ii) provide to CTWS as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
copies of any such SJW Takeover Proposal or inquiry or proposal received in
writing (including drafts of Acquisition Agreements) exchanged between SJW or
any of its Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives and any Person
who describes any of the terms or conditions of any SJW Takeover Proposal.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ shall prohibit SJW from
complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Laws
regarding a SJW Takeover Proposal or a SJW Adverse Recommendation Change,
including with respect to (i) disclosing a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such disclosure or communication does not reaffirm the
SJW Recommendation, or has the effect of modifying or qualifying the SJW
Recommendation in any manner adverse to CTWS, such disclosure or communication
shall constitute a SJW Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _SJW Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) made by any Person or Persons other than CTWS or any of its
Affiliates, with respect to any (i) merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share

dissolution or similar transaction involving SJW or any SJW Subsidiary, (ii)
sale, lease, contribution or other disposition, directly or indirectly
(including by way of merger, amalgamation, consolidation, share exchange,
other business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, partnership, joint venture, sale of capital stock or voting
securities of, or other equity interests in, a SJW Subsidiary or otherwise) of
any business or assets of SJW or the SJW Subsidiaries

 



57 representing 15% or more of the consolidated revenues, net income or assets of
SJW and the SJW Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) issuance, sale or other
disposition, directly or indirectly, to any Person (or the stockholders of any
Person) or group of securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, such
securities) representing 15% or more of the total outstanding voting power of
SJW, (iv) transaction in which any Person (or the stockholders of any Person)
shall acquire, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership, or the right to
acquire beneficial ownership, or formation of any group which beneficially
owns or has the right to acquire beneficial ownership of, 15% or more of the
total outstanding voting power of SJW or (v) combination of the foregoing (in
each case, other than the Merger).

" _Superior SJW Proposal_ " means any bona fide written offer made by a third
party or group pursuant to which such third party (or in a merger or
consolidation involving such party, the stockholders of such third party) or
group would acquire, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the SJW Common
Shares or all or substantially all of the assets of SJW and the SJW
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) on terms which the SJW Board determines in
its reasonable judgment (after consultation with outside counsel and the SJW
Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be superior to the Merger, taking into account all of the terms
and conditions of such offer (including the legal, financial, regulatory, the
availability and terms of any required financing, timing and other aspects of
the proposal, the identity of the Person making the proposal, any risks of
non-consummation of the proposal and any other factors that the SJW Board
determines are appropriate under the circumstances) and this Agreement
(including any changes proposed by CTWS to the terms of this Agreement) and
(ii) that is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms proposed taking
into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal, and is fully financed and for which financing (if required) is fully
committed and reasonably likely to be obtained.

to lead to a CTWS Takeover Proposal or (ii) directly or indirectly
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
CTWSs Representatives) regarding, or furnish to any Person (other than CTWSs
Representatives) any non-public information with respect to, any CTWS
Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably be expected
to lead to a CTWS Takeover Proposal (other than to state that the terms of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ prohibit any such discussions). CTWS shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and direct its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any CTWS Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to a CTWS Takeover Proposal, request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously

 



58 furnished to any such Person or its Representatives and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
prior to obtaining the CTWS Shareholder Approval, in response to a bona fide
written CTWS Takeover Proposal that the CTWS Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel and the CTWS Financial Advisor or
another financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior CTWS Proposal, and that did not
result from a material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_, CTWS, and its
Representatives at the request of CTWS, may, subject to compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_, (x) furnish information with respect to CTWS and
the CTWS Subsidiaries to the Person making such CTWS Takeover Proposal (and
its Representatives) ( _provided_ that all such information has previously
been provided to SJW or is provided to SJW prior to or

Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (y) participate in discussions regarding the
terms of such CTWS Takeover Proposal and the negotiation of such terms with,
and only with, the Person making such CTWS Takeover Proposal (and such
Persons Representatives). Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_
by any CTWS Subsidiary or any of its or their Representatives shall constitute
a breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ by CTWS.

nationally recognized reputation) that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that CTWS shall not be entitled to exercise its right to make a
CTWS Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a CTWS Takeover Proposal
or a Superior CTWS Proposal until after 96 hours following SJWs receipt of
written notice (a " _CTWS Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") from CTWS
advising SJW that the CTWS Board intends to make a CTWS Adverse Recommendation
Change and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms
and conditions of any CTWS Takeover Proposal or Superior CTWS Proposal that
is the basis of the proposed action by the CTWS Board (it being understood and
agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of
such CTWS Takeover Proposal or Superior CTWS Proposal shall require a new
CTWS Notice of Recommendation Change, except that any subsequent notice period
shall be reduced to 72 hours). In determining whether to make a CTWS Adverse
Recommendation Change, the CTWS Board shall take into account any changes to
the terms of

 



59  this Agreement proposed by SJW in response to a CTWS Notice of

_however_ , that if any such disclosure or communication does not reaffirm the

sharing of such document or information would result in a violation of
applicable Law. If any material is withheld by such party pursuant to the

Section 6.05 _Awards under CTWS Stock Plan._  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the CTWS Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall
adopt such resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any
required consents) as may be required to effect the following:

 

(i) _CTWS Performance Share Units_.

 

(1) _Awards Granted Prior to Date of this Agreement_. At the Effective Time,
each unvested CTWS Performance Share Unit award that was granted prior to the
date of this Agreement and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become vested as to that number of CTWS Common Shares
determined by calculating the actual performance of the performance goals
applicable under the terms of the award up to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that any applicable performance goals (as specified in the agreement
evidencing the award) may be adjusted as determined by the CTWS
Compensation Committee in its reasonable discretion to the extent necessary
to eliminate the impact on such performance goals of any non-recurring costs
and expenses (including out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with the negotiation, execution, performance and delivery of this
Agreement or related documents or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; and thereafter each CTWS
Performance Share Unit determined to have vested pursuant to such calculation
(the " _Vested Performance Share Units_ ") shall be cancelled and converted
into, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. For the avoidance of doubt, any CTWS Performance Share Units
that do not become Vested Performance Share Units pursuant to the
determination set forth herein shall be cancelled with no consideration paid
therefor.

(2) _Awards Granted on or After Date of this Agreement_. At the Effective
Time, each CTWS Performance Share Unit award that was granted on or

 



68  after the date of this Agreement and that is outstanding and unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by SJW and
converted automatically (without regard to the attainment of the applicable
performance goals) into a time-based award (each, an " _Assumed PSU Award_ ")
covering a number of restricted share units of SJW equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the target number of restricted share units
outstanding and unvested under such CTWS Performance Share Unit award
immediately prior to the Closing by (y) the Exchange Ratio, with
any fractional restricted share units rounded down to the next lower whole
number of restricted share units. Each Assumed PSU Award shall thereafter be
subject to the same service-based vesting terms (such as vesting at the
conclusion of a fiscal year for annual awards and ratable vesting over a
three-year period for long-term awards measured from the grant date of the
applicable CTWS Performance Share Unit award (as specified in the agreement
evidencing the award)) and other terms and conditions, but not any
performance-based vesting terms, applicable to the converted CTWS Performance
Share Unit award under the applicable CTWS Stock Plan and the agreement
evidencing the award, including as to the settlement date for the
award following vesting. CTWS Performance Share Unit Awards granted on or
after the date of this Agreement shall not be subject to any accelerated
vesting for any reason (including, without limitation, due to retirement or
pursuant to the terms of any employment agreement between recipient and
CTWS), except to the extent approved by the SJW Board (or a committee
thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, any CTWS Performance Share Units that do
not vest pursuant to the determination set forth herein shall be cancelled
with no consideration paid therefor.

(ii) _CTWS Restricted Share Units_. At the Effective Time, each
CTWS Restricted Share Unit award that is outstanding and unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted automatically into an
award covering a number of restricted share units of SJW (each, an "
_Adjusted RSU Award_ ") equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
total number of restricted share units outstanding and unvested under the CTWS
Restricted Share Unit award immediately prior to the Closing by (y) the
Exchange Ratio, with any fractional restricted share units rounded down to the
next lower whole number of restricted share units. Each Adjusted RSU Award
shall otherwise be subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to the
converted CTWS Restricted Share Unit award under the applicable CTWS Stock
Plan and the agreements evidencing the award, including as to vesting and
payment of cash or stock, as applicable, upon vesting.

 

(iii) _CTWS Performance Cash Units_.

 

(1) _Awards Granted Prior to Date of this Agreement_. At the Effective Time,
each unvested CTWS Performance Cash Unit award that was granted prior to the
date of this Agreement and that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall become vested as to a cash amount determined by
calculating the actual performance of the performance goals applicable under
the terms of the award up to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that any
applicable performance goals (as specified in the agreement evidencing the
award) may be adjusted as determined by the CTWS Compensation Committee in its
reasonable discretion to the extent necessary to eliminate

 



69  the impact on such performance goals of any non-recurring costs and expenses
(including out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with the negotiation, execution, performance and delivery of this Agreement or
related documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby _;_ and thereafter each CTWS Performance Cash Unit determined to
have vested pursuant to such calculation (the " _Vested Performance Cash
Units_ ") shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall thereafter
represent the right only to receive, an amount in cash equal to the number of
such Vested Performance Cash Units, multiplied by the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) the SJW Common Share Closing VWAP. For the avoidance
of doubt, any CTWS Performance Cash Units that do not become Vested
Performance Cash Units pursuant to the determination set forth herein shall be
cancelled with no consideration paid therefor.

 

(2) _Awards Granted on or After Date of this Agreement_. At the Effective
Time, each unvested CTWS Performance Cash Unit award that was granted on or
after the date of this Agreement and that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be assumed by SJW and converted automatically
(without regard to the attainment of the applicable performance goals) into a
time-based vesting award (each, an " _Assumed PCU Award_ ") covering a cash
amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the target number of
outstanding and unvested CTWS Performance Cash Units subject to such award
immediately prior to the Closing by the product of (x) the Exchange Ratio and
(y) the SJW Common Share Closing VWAP. Each Assumed PCU Award
shall thereafter be subject to the same service-based vesting terms (such as
vesting at the conclusion of a fiscal year for annual awards and ratable
vesting over a three-year period for long-term awards measured from the grant
date of the applicable CTWS Performance Cash Unit award (as specified in the
agreement evidencing the award)) and other terms and conditions, but not any
performance-based vesting terms, applicable to the converted CTWS Performance
Cash Unit award under the applicable CTWS Stock Plan and the agreement
evidencing the award, including as to the settlement date for the award
following vesting. CTWS Performance Cash Unit Awards granted on or after the
date of this Agreement shall not be subject to any accelerated vesting for
any reason (including, without limitation, due to retirement or pursuant to
the terms of any employment agreement between recipient and CTWS), except to
the extent approved by the SJW Board (or a committee thereof). For the
avoidance of doubt, any CTWS Performance Cash Units that do not vest pursuant
to the determination set forth herein shall be cancelled with no consideration
paid therefor.

 

(iv) _CTWS Deferred Share Units_. At the Effective Time, each CTWS Deferred
Share Unit award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted automatically into a number of deferred share
units of SJW (each, an " _Adjusted DSU Award_ ") equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the total number of CTWS Deferred Share
Units outstanding under the CTWS Deferred Share Unit award immediately prior
to the Closing by (y) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional share units
rounded down to the next lower whole number of share units. Each Adjusted DSU
Award shall otherwise be subject to the same terms

 



70  and conditions (including the time of payment) applicable to the converted
CTWS Deferred Share Unit award under the deferral elections applicable to the
award thereunder.

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05(a), to the
extent any award described in this Section 6.05(a) (including an award
subject to a deferral election under the terms of a CTWS Stock Plan) is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, such award will be paid out at the time
or times set forth in the applicable award agreement or under the applicable
deferral election but in all events in compliance with Section 409A of the
Code.

(b) At or before the Effective Time, CTWS shall (1) take all actions that may
be necessary or that SJW considers reasonably appropriate (under the CTWS
Stock Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.05_ and ensure that the CTWS Stock Plans and CTWS equity
awards can be assumed or cancelled, as the case may be, in accordance with
those provisions and (2) cause to be effected, in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to SJW, any amendments to the CTWS Stock Plans necessary to give
effect to the foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_.

(c) SJW shall take all actions that are necessary for the assumption of the
CTWS Stock Plans and equity awards pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.05(a)_
including the reservation, issuance and listing of SJW Common Shares as
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _
6.05_. If registration of any plan interests in the CTWS Stock Plans or other
CTWS Benefit Plans or the shares of SJW Common Shares issuable thereunder is
required under the Securities Act, SJW shall file with the SEC within 30
Business Days following the Closing Date a registration statement on Form S-8
with respect to such interests or SJW Common Shares (to the extent such Form
is available for registration of such interest and shares), and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as the assumed equity awards remain outstanding or other
CTWS Benefit Plans, as applicable, remain in effect and such registration of
interests therein or the SJW Common Shares issuable thereunder continues to be
required. As soon as practicable after the registration of such interests or
shares, as applicable, SJW shall deliver to the holders of CTWS equity awards
appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
respective CTWS Stock Plans and agreements evidencing the grants of such CTWS
equity awards, and stating that such CTWS equity awards and agreements have
been assumed by SJW and shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.05_
after giving effect to the Merger and the terms of the CTWS Stock Plans).

(d) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, CTWS shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that, as of the Effective Time, no CTWS
Personnel or any other current or former participant in any CTWS Stock Plan or
any CTWS Benefit Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests in, SJW, CTWS or
their respective Subsidiaries.

Section 6.06 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
each of SJW and the Surviving Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless, advance expenses to and exculpate each former and present director
or officer of CTWS or any CTWS

 



71  Subsidiary, determined as of the Effective Time (the " _CTWS Indemnified
Parties_ "), against and with respect to all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, Judgments, inquiries, fines, fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
suit, action or other proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby), arising out of or pertaining to the fact
that the CTWS Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of CTWS or
any CTWS Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of CTWS or any CTWS
Subsidiary as a director or officer of another Person, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time.

 

(b) In the event that SJW, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, in each case SJW and the
Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of SJW or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable,
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ contemporaneous
with the closing of any such consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, CTWS shall and, if CTWS is unable to, SJW
shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to, obtain and
fully pay for "tail" directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_")
for the CTWS Indemnified Parties with a claims period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time, from one or more insurance carriers with
the same or better credit rating as CTWSs DandO Insurance carrier as of the
date of this Agreement, and with terms, conditions, retentions, limits of
liability and levels of coverage at least as favorable as CTWSs existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions or actions contemplated hereby). If CTWS and the Surviving
Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" DandO Insurance as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation (or its successor) shall, and SJW
shall cause the Surviving Corporation (or its successor) to, continue to
maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, for the CTWS Indemnified Parties, DandO Insurance from one or
more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as CTWSs DandO
Insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement, and with terms,
conditions, retentions, limits of liability and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as CTWSs existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall SJW be required in any year
to pay under this _Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ more than 300% of the aggregate
annual premium payable by CTWS for its DandO Insurance for the period ended
August 31, 2018 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and if SJW is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.06(c)_ for an amount that is
equal to or less than the Maximum Amount, it shall obtain DandO Insurance for
the six-year period with the greatest coverage available for an amount equal
to the Maximum Amount.

 



72 (d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.06_ (i) shall
survive consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each CTWS Indemnified Party and his or her

target annual cash incentive opportunities that are no less favorable than
the target annual cash incentive opportunities provided by CTWS or any of its
Subsidiaries to each such CTWS Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time, (3) benefits, other than severance benefits and change of
control benefits, that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
benefits provided to CTWS Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (4) severance benefits that are no less favorable than the severance
benefits provided by SJW or any SJW Subsidiary to similarly situated
employees of SJW and the SJW Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ that the immediately preceding clause (4) shall not apply to
each CTWS Employee entitled to severance benefits under any agreement or plan
set forth on Section 6.17(b) of the CTWS Disclosure Letter. Each CTWS Employee
who received a long-term incentive award under the CTWS Stock Plan in 2018
shall be granted an equity incentive award under the SJW Stock Plan for each
calendar year in the Covered Period (other than a calendar year in which the
CTWS Employee received a long-term incentive award under the CTWS Stock Plan).
Any such award granted under the SJW Stock Plan to a CTWS Employee shall be
made at the same time and subject to the same terms and conditions as awards
made to SJWs executive officers, provided that the target and maximum dollar
values of the award shall be equal to or greater than the target and
maximum dollar values of the last award granted to such CTWS Employee under
the CTWS Stock Plan prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ further that such
awards shall be subject to the accelerated vesting terms of any employment
agreement between such employee and SJW or CTWS in effect at the time of the
grant of such award.

on Section 6.17(b) of the CTWS Disclosure Letter.

(c) In the event any CTWS Employee becomes eligible to participate under any
benefit plans maintained by SJW or any SJW Subsidiary following the Effective
Time, for purposes of determining (i) eligibility to participate and vesting
with respect to such benefit plans maintained by SJW or any SJW Subsidiary
(other than with respect to defined benefit pension plans and equity or
equity-related plans maintained by SJW or any SJW Subsidiary) and (ii) level
of benefits under vacation and severance plans and arrangements (and not any
other plans or arrangements) maintained by SJW or any SJW Subsidiary, service
with CTWS or any of the CTWS Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer of an
employee of CTWS or any CTWS Subsidiary, to the extent service with such
predecessor employer is recognized by CTWS or the applicable CTWS Subsidiary
as of the date of this Agreement) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated
as service with SJW or the SJW Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such service

 



79 need not be recognized to the extent (A) that such recognition would result in
any duplication of benefits, (B) not recognized by CTWS or a CTWS Subsidiary,
as applicable, for similar purposes, or (C) the benefit plan or arrangement of
SJW or any SJW Subsidiary is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to
eligibility to participate, vesting or level of benefits.

benefit plans maintained by SJW or any SJW Subsidiary following the Effective
Time, for purposes of each benefit plan of SJW or the SJW Subsidiaries, SJW
and the SJW Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such plans to be waived for employees of CTWS and the CTWS Subsidiaries and
their covered dependents (other than limitations, including pre-existing
conditions exclusions, or waiting periods that are already in effect with
respect to such employees and dependents under the benefit plans of CTWS and
the CTWS Subsidiaries and that have not been satisfied as of the date such
employees and dependents commence participation in such benefit plans of SJW
and the SJW Subsidiaries) and (ii) give full credit for all co-payments and
deductibles to the extent satisfied in the plan year in which the Effective
Time occurs (or the year in which employees of CTWS and the CTWS Subsidiaries
and their dependents commence participation in the benefit plans of SJW and
the SJW Subsidiaries, if later).

(e) This _Section_ __ _ 6.17_ shall be binding upon and shall inure solely
to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.17_, express or implied, (i) is intended to confer upon any
other person (including any current or former directors, officers,
consultants or employees of any of CTWS or any CTWS Subsidiary or, on or after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its subsidiaries) any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever, (ii) is intended to be, shall
constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of any employee
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of SJW, CTWS, the
Surviving Corporation or any respective Subsidiary thereof or (iii) obligates
SJW or any of the SJW Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any particular
employee of CTWS or any CTWS Subsidiary following the Effective Time.

 

Section 6.18 _Cooperation_. Each of SJW and CTWS will, and will cause its
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to, use its reasonable best
efforts, subject to applicable Law, to cooperate with the other party in
connection with planning the integration of the business operations of SJW and
CTWS and their respective Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.19 _Voting Agreements_. SJW agrees that it will not terminate any of
the Voting Agreements pursuant to Section 3(a) thereof, or amend any of the
Voting Agreements pursuant to Section 4(h) thereof, without the prior written
consent of CTWS (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). SJW further acknowledges and agrees that CTWS is an express third-
party beneficiary of, and is entitled to specifically enforce the obligations
of the parties to the Voting Agreements set forth in, the provisions of the
Voting Agreements enumerated in Section 4(h) thereof.

 

Section 6.20 _Post-Merger Community Commitment_. SJW and CTWS each agree that
provision of charitable contributions and community support in their
respective service areas serves a number of their important corporate goals.
During the two-year period immediately following the Effective Time, SJW and
the Surviving Corporation agree to continue to provide

 



80 charitable contributions and community support within the service areas of SJW
and CTWS, and each of their respective Subsidiaries in each such service
area, at levels substantially comparable to the levels of charitable
contributions and community support provided, directly or indirectly, by SJW
and CTWS within their respective service areas during the two-year period
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

to "materiality" or "SJW Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) at and
as of the Closing Date as if made at and as of such date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be
true and correct (without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality"
or "SJW Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein), individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
SJW Material Adverse Effect, and the representations and warranties of SJW
and Merger Sub contained in _Sections 3.03(d)_ , _3.04_ and _3.22_ shall be
true and correct in all material respects at and as of the Closing Date as if
made at and as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as of an

longer exists.

(d) _Merger Opinion_. CTWS shall have received the written opinion of Sullivan
and Cromwell LLP, or such other nationally recognized Tax counsel reasonably
satisfactory to SJW, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that for U.S.

or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
