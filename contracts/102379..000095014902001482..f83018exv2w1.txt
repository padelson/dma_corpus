5.    (f) SHARES OF DISSENTING STOCKHOLDERS. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of
Target Companies Common Stock held by a person (a "Dissenting Stockholder")
who has not voted in favor of or consented to the Mergers and complies with
Section 262 and all other provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of
holders of Target Companies Common Stock to require appraisal of their shares
of Target Companies Common Stock ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted
in the manner provided in Section 2.01(c), but shall become the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Stockholder withdraws such Dissenting Stockholder\'s demand for
appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses such Dissenting
Stockholder\'s right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL, the
Target Companies Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder shall be
deemed to be cancelled as of the Effective Time and shall become the right to
receive, in respect of such cancelled Target Companies Common Stock, the
consideration set forth in Section 2.01(c) to be delivered in exchange for
a share of Target Companies Common Stock pursuant to the Mergers. The
Target Companies shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
of shares received by either of the Target Companies.   SECTION 2.02
ESTIMATED NET DEBT AT CLOSING.   (a) Within ten (10) business days of the
Closing Date, and in no event less than two (2) business days before the
Closing Date, the Holder Representative shall deliver to Parent a certificate
signed by the Chief Financial Officer of each of EGandG; and Lear setting forth
a reasonable estimate of the Net Debt at Closing of the Target Companies as
of the Closing Date (the "Estimated Net Debt at Closing"), together with a
written statement setting forth the calculation of such estimate.   (b) If
the Estimated Net Debt at Closing is less than the Net Debt at Closing as
determined pursuant to Section 2.02(c) and (d) below (as so determined, the
"Final Net Debt at Closing"), then the Cash Merger Consideration will be
decreased by the amount by which the Final Net Debt at Closing exceeds the
Estimated Net Debt at Closing, and if the Estimated Net Debt at Closing
is greater than the Final Net Debt at Closing, the Cash Merger Consideration
will be increased by the amount by which the Estimated Net Debt at Closing
exceeds the Final Net Debt at Closing.   (c) As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within ninety (90)
calendar days thereof, the Holder Representative shall prepare and deliver to
Parent (i) a consolidated balance sheet of each of the Target Companies as of
the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheets") and (ii) a calculation of Net
Debt at Closing of the Target Companies as reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheets. The Closing Balance Sheets shall be prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with
the preparation of the historical consolidated financial statements of the
Target Companies, and shall fairly present the consolidated financial
position of the Target Companies as of the Closing. Following the Closing,
Parent shall provide the Holder Representative and its representatives full
access to the records and employees of the Target Companies to the extent
necessary for the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheets and shall cause
the employees of the    6.   Target Companies to cooperate with the
Holder Representative in connection with its preparation of the Closing
Balance Sheets.   (d) If Parent shall disagree with the calculation of Net
Debt at Closing, it shall notify the Holder Representative of such
disagreement in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail the particulars
of such disagreement, within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the
Closing Balance Sheets. In the event that Parent does not provide such a
notice of disagreement within such thirty (30) day period, Parent shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Balance Sheets and the calculation of the
Net Debt at Closing delivered by the Holder Representative, which shall be
final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event any
such notice of disagreement is timely provided, Parent and the Holder
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
thirty (30) days (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculation of Net Debt at
Closing. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve such
disagreements, then KPMG LLP (or such other independent accounting firm
of recognized national standing as may be mutually selected by Parent and
the Holder Representative) (the "Auditor") shall resolve any
remaining disagreements. The Auditor shall determine as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of the date on which
such dispute is referred to the Auditor, only whether the Closing Balance
Sheets were prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in Section
2.02(c) and (only with respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to
the Auditor) whether and to what extent (if any) Net Debt at Closing requires
adjustment. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be paid one-half by
Parent and one-half by the Holder Representative, each of which shall
execute, if requested by the Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter. The
determination of the Auditor shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
parties. The date on which Final Net Debt at Closing is finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.02(d) is hereinafter referred to as the
"Determination Date."   (e) The Escrowed Cash (as defined in Section
2.01(d)) shall be paid by Parent to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow
pending determination of the Final Net Debt at Closing. The Escrowed Cash
shall be held and invested by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement. Upon final determination of the Final Net Debt at
Closing in accordance with Sections 2.02(c) and (d), each of Parent and the
Holder Representative shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse the Escrowed Cash as set forth
in this Section 2.02(e). If the Estimated Net Debt at Closing exceeds the
Final Net Debt at Closing, then, promptly following the Determination Date,
and in any event within five (5) business days of the Determination Date, (i)
the Escrow Agent shall pay to the holders of Target Companies Common Stock
that are entitled to receive Cash Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.01 hereof the Escrowed Cash, together with all interest earned on such
Escrowed Cash (with 79.50% of such amount paid to holders of EGandG; Common
Stock according to Such Holder\'s EGandG; Exchange Ratio and 20.50% of such
amount paid to holders of Lear Common Stock according to Such Holder\'s Lear
Exchange Ratio), and (ii) Parent shall pay to the holders of the Target
Companies Common Stock that are entitled to receive the Cash
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 (in the proportions describe
above in this sentence) an amount in cash equal to the excess of the
Estimated Net Debt at Closing over the Final Net Debt at Closing. If the
Final Net Debt at Closing exceeds the Estimated Net Debt at Closing, then,
promptly following the Determination Date, and in any event within five (5)
business days of the Determination Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to   
7.   Parent the amount by which the Final Net Debt at Closing exceeds the
Estimated Net Debt at Closing, together with all interest earned on such
amount, and any remaining Escrowed Cash shall be distributed to the holders
of Target Companies Common Stock in the proportions set forth in the previous
sentence of this Section 2.02(e).   SECTION 2.03 EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES.   (a) FUNDING OF THE EXCHANGE AGENT. Immediately prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall pay to an exchange agent (the "Exchange
Agent") selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Holder
Representative, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount
(the "Funding Amount") equal to the Cash Merger Consideration, minus the
Escrowed Cash, minus the amount of cash that holders of Dissenting Shares
would have been entitled to receive had they been entitled to participate in
the receipt of Merger Consideration, and Parent shall deliver to the Exchange
Agent certificates evidencing (x) a number of shares of Bridge Preferred
Stock equal to the Bridge Preferred Stock Merger Consideration, minus the
number of shares of Bridge Preferred Stock that would have been issuable to
holders of Dissenting Shares had they been entitled to participate in receipt
of the Merger Consideration, minus the Escrowed Shares and (y) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Common Stock Merger Consideration,
minus the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would have been
issuable to holders of Dissenting Shares had they been entitled to
participate in receipt of the Merger Consideration.   (b) EXCHANGE
PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Target Companies Common Stock (the "Certificates") at
the Effective Time, whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock, shares of Bridge Preferred Stock and cash
pursuant to Section 2.01, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and
containing such provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and which
shall have been approved by the Holder Representative, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (ii) a stockholder certification
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B (a "Stockholder
Certification") and (iii) instructions for use in surrendering the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Parent Common Stock,
Bridge Preferred Stock and cash. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal
and Stockholder Certification, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates
representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and Bridge
Preferred Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.01(c), certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.03(d), cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock in accordance with Section
2.03(e), and the cash which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of Section 2.01(c); and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Target
Companies Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
applicable Target Company, a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Parent Common Stock and Bridge Preferred Stock and the proper
amount of EGandG; Cash Merger Consideration or Lear Cash Merger Consideration,
as applicable, for such shares may be issued to a person other than   
8.   the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered
if such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such issuance pays any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Bridge Preferred Stock or the payment of such cash to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establishes to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.03, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the shares of Parent Common Stock, shares of Bridge Preferred
Stock and cash that the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of
such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.01(c), certain
dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section 2.03(d) and cash
in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock or Bridge Preferred
Stock in accordance with Section 2.03(e). No interest shall be paid or will
accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II.   (c) RETURN OF EXCHANGE FUND. Promptly
following the date which is one year after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent all cash, certificates and
other documents in its possession relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and the Exchange Agent\'s duties will terminate. Thereafter, each
holder of a Certificate that has not complied with this Section 2.03 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Common Stock
Merger Consideration, Bridge Preferred Stock Merger Consideration and Cash
Merger Consideration.   (d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED
SHARES. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock represented
thereby, and, in the case of Certificates representing Target Companies
Common Stock, no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder pursuant to Section 2.03(e), and all such dividends, other
distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock or
Bridge Preferred Stock shall not be paid to any such holder until such holder
surrenders such Certificate in accordance with this Article II (at which time
such holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends or other
dividends or other distributions).   (e) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES.   (i) No
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
or Bridge Preferred Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate to such
fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of
Parent.   (ii) Any holder of Target Companies Common Stock who
would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock issuable to such holder) shall,
in lieu of such fraction of a share and, upon surrender of such holder\'s
Certificates, be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest   
9.   whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock by the Parent Closing Stock Price or such
fraction of a share of Bridge Preferred Stock by the Liquidation Preference,
as applicable.   (f) NO LIABILITY. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporations shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares of Parent
Common Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock, any dividends or distributions with
respect thereto, or any cash amounts, in each case, delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   (g) LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, Parent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common
Stock, the shares of Bridge Preferred Stock and the cash payable pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) with respect to such Certificate, any unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock or Bridge Preferred Stock
deliverable in respect thereof, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, in
each case, due to such person pursuant to this Agreement.   SECTION 2.04
CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. If after the date hereof and on or prior to the
Effective Time the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, Bridge
Preferred Stock or Target Companies Common Stock shall be changed into
a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, or any
dividend payable in stock or other securities shall be declared thereon with
a record date within such period, or any similar event shall occur, the
applicable Exchange Ratio or the Common Stock Merger Consideration, as
applicable, shall be proportionally adjusted to reflect such
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange or
dividend or similar event.   SECTION 2.05 HOLDER ALLOCABLE EXPENSES. On or
prior to the Closing Date, the Holder Representative will notify Parent and
the Target Companies of the amount (the "Estimated Expense Amount") that the
Holder Representative determines in good faith to be necessary to pay any
accrued and unpaid expenses incurred, or to be incurred, by the Holder
Representative (on behalf of the Target Companies) in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the performance by

such reserves as the Holder Representative determines in good faith to be

Immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Target Companies shall pay to the
Holder Representative by wire transfer of immediately available funds in an
amount equal to the Estimated Expense Amount. If the Holder
Representative determines in good faith that the Estimated Expense Amount
exceeds the Holder Allocable Expenses, then the Holder   
10.   Representative shall cause funds in the amount of such excess to be
allocated in the manner set forth in Section 2.01(c) as if such excess amount
were Cash Merger Consideration and distributed as so allocated.   SECTION

status of any such trust, except for any occurrence that individually or in
the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Target Companies. As of the    17.   date hereof, there
are no actions, suits or claims pending, or to the knowledge of the Target

ERISA (a "Target Companies DB Plan"), and any Target Companies Benefit Plan
that provides medical benefits (whether or not insured) with respect
to current or former employers after retirement or other termination of
service) can be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued after the
Effective Time in accordance with its terms, without material liability to
the Target Companies or any Target Companies Affiliate. To the knowledge of
the Target Companies, as of the date hereof, there are no audits, inquiries
or proceedings pending or threatened by the IRS, Department of Labor ("DOL"),
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity with
respect to any Target Companies Benefit Plan.   (vi) Except as any of the
following either individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Target Companies, (A)
neither of the Target Companies nor any Target Companies Affiliate has
incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA and no condition exists that
presents a reasonable risk now or in the future to the Target Companies or
any Target Companies Affiliate of incurring any such liability (other than
liability for benefits or premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation arising in the ordinary course), (B) to the knowledge of the
Target Companies, no Target Companies Benefit Plan has incurred
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code) whether or not waived, and (C) with respect
to each Target Companies DB Plan, to the knowledge of the Target Companies,
the assets of such plan equal or exceed the "benefit liabilities" (as defined

the failure so to comply individually or in the aggregate would not have a
material adverse effect on Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, no suit,
action or, to the knowledge of Parent, investigation by or before any
Governmental Entity in each case with respect to Parent or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened, other than, in each case, those the outcome
of which individually or in the aggregate would not (i) reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent or (ii) materially
impair or delay the ability of Parent or the Merger Subs to perform their
respective obligations under this Agreement.   (h) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
AND EMPLOYMENT MATTERS.   (i) Section 3.02(h)(i) of the Parent Disclosure
Schedule contains an accurate and complete list as of the date hereof of each
collective bargaining agreement and each material plan or other arrangement
providing for compensation, severance benefits, vacation pay, deferred
compensation, performance awards, stock or stock-related awards, fringe
benefits or other employee benefits, whether written or unwritten, including,
without limitation, any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA, providing benefits to any current or former employee, officer
or director of Parent, any of its wholly owned subsidiaries or any joint
venture in which Parent or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries participates
(each a "Parent Affiliate"), or with respect to which Parent or any Parent
Affiliate has or may in the future have material liability (collectively, the
"Parent Benefit Plans").   (ii) Since December 31, 2001, there has not been
any adoption or amendment in any material respect by Parent, or, to the
knowledge of Parent, by any Parent Affiliate, of any Parent Benefit Plan, or
any material change in any actuarial or other assumption used to calculate
funding obligations with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, or any change in
the manner in which contributions to any Parent Benefit Plan are made or the
basis on which such contributions are determined. Parent does not intend nor
has it committed to establish any new Parent Benefit Plan, to modify any
Parent Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by law or to conform any
such Parent Benefit Plan to the requirements of any applicable law, in each
case as previously disclosed to the Target Companies in writing, or as
required by this Agreement), or to enter into any Parent Benefit Plan.  
(iii) Parent has made available to the Target Companies correct and complete
copies of (i) all documents setting forth the terms of each Parent Benefit
Plan, including, without limitation, all amendments thereto and all related
trust documents, (ii) the three (3) most recent annual reports (Form Series
5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any,
required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each Parent Benefit Plan,
(iii) if Parent Benefit Plan is subject to the minimum funding standards of
ERISA Section 302, the most recent annual and periodic accounting of
Parent Benefit Plan assets, (iv) the most recent summary plan description
together with the summaries of material modifications thereto, if any,
required under ERISA with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan, (v) all
material written agreements and contracts relating to each Parent Benefit
Plan, including, without limitation, administrative service agreements and
group insurance contracts, (vi) all    28.   written materials provided
to any employee or employees with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan, in each
case relating to any amendments, terminations, establishments, increases or
decreases in benefits, acceleration of payments or vesting schedules or other
events that would result in any material liability to Parent or any Parent
Affiliate, (vii) all material correspondence, if any, to or from any
governmental agency relating to any Parent Benefit Plan, (viii) a sample
COBRA form and related notice, (ix) all insurance policies, if any, in the
possession of Parent or any Parent Affiliate pertaining to
fiduciary liability insurance covering the fiduciaries of each Parent Benefit
Plan, (x) all discrimination tests, if any, required under the Code for each
Parent Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
for the three (3) most recent plan years, and (xi) the most recent
determination or opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to each Parent
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, if
any.   (iv) Except as set forth in Section 3.02(h)(iv) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Parent, no event has occurred
and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with any
of the Parent Benefit Plans which would subject Parent or any Parent
Affiliate to any liability that individually or in the aggregate would have a
material adverse effect on Parent under ERISA, the Code or any other
applicable law.   (v) To the knowledge of Parent, each Parent Benefit Plan
has been administered in accordance with its terms, except for any failures
so to administer any Parent Benefit Plan that individually or in the
aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, all the Parent Benefit Plans are in
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and all other
applicable laws and the terms of all applicable collective bargaining
agreements, except for any failures to be in such compliance that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on Parent or have been corrected in accordance with
any government-sponsored voluntary correction program. Each Parent Benefit
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (i)
has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so
qualified; (ii) has filed an application for a determination letter with the
IRS; or (iii) if such plan is not permitted to apply for a determination
letter, is being operated in accordance with applicable law. Each trust
established in connection with any Parent Benefit Plan that is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code (i)
has received a determination letter from the IRS that such trust is so
exempt; (ii) has filed an application for a determination letter with the
IRS; or (iii) if such trust is not permitted to apply for a determination
letter, is being operated in accordance with applicable law. To the knowledge
of Parent, no fact or event has occurred since the date of any determination
letter from the IRS which is reasonably likely to affect adversely the
qualified status of any such Parent Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any
such trust, except for any occurrence that individually or in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent.
As of the date hereof, there are no actions, suits or claims pending, or to
the knowledge of Parent, threatened or reasonably anticipated (other than
routine claims for benefits) against any Parent Benefit Plan or against the
assets of any Parent Benefit Plan. Each Parent Benefit Plan (other than any
Parent Benefit Plan to be terminated prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with this Agreement, any Parent Benefit Plan that is a "defined
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (a "Parent DB Plan"), and
any Parent Benefit Plan that provides medical benefits (whether or not
insured) with respect to current or former employers    29.   after
retirement or other termination of service) can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms, without material liability to Parent or any Parent Affiliate. To the
knowledge of Parent, as of the date hereof, there are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending or threatened by the IRS, DOL, Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Parent
Benefit Plan.   (vi) Except as any of the following either individually or
in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Parent, (A) neither Parent nor any Parent Affiliate has incurred
any liability under Title IV of ERISA and no condition exists that presents
a reasonable risk now or in the future to Parent or any Parent Affiliate
of incurring any such liability (other than liability for benefits or
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary
course), (B) to the knowledge of Parent, no Parent Benefit Plan has incurred
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code) whether or not waived, and (C) with respect
to each Parent DB Plan, to the knowledge of Parent, the assets of such plan
equal or exceed the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16)
of ERISA and valued on the basis of the continuation, and not the
termination, of such Parent Benefit Plan).   (vii) Except as set forth on
Section 3.02(h)(vii) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, neither Parent nor
any Parent Affiliate is a party to any collective bargaining or other labor
union contract applicable to persons employed by either of the Parent or any
Parent Affiliate and to the knowledge of Parent, no collective bargaining
agreement is being negotiated by Parent or any Parent Affiliate, in each case
that is material to Parent and Parent Affiliates taken as a whole. As of the
date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, there is no labor
dispute, strike or work stoppage against Parent or any Parent Affiliate
pending or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened which may interfere with
the respective business activities of Parent or any Parent Affiliate, except
where such dispute, strike or work stoppage individually or in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Parent.
As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Parent, none of Parent,
any Parent Affiliate or any of their respective representatives or employees
has committed any unfair labor practice in connection with the operation of
the respective businesses of Parent or any Parent Affiliate, and there is no
charge or complaint against Parent or any Parent Affiliate by the National
Labor Relations Board or any comparable governmental agency pending
or threatened in writing, except for any occurrence that individually or in
the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on Parent.   (viii) Except as set forth on Section 3.02(h)(viii) of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no Parent Benefit Plan provides medical
benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to current or former employees
after retirement or other termination of service the cost of which is
material to Parent and the Parent Affiliates taken as a whole, and to the
knowledge of Parent, any such Parent Benefit Plan providing such post-
termination or post-retirement medical benefits may be terminated without any
additional cost that would be material to Parent and the Parent Affiliates
taken as a whole. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "additional cost"
shall mean a cost that exceeds the value of any assets that may be held in
trust for purposes of providing such benefits under the Parent Benefit
Plan.    30.    (ix) Except as set forth on Section 3.02(h)(ix) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, no amounts payable under the Parent Benefit Plans
solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by
virtue of Section 280G of the Code. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with
another event, (A) entitle any current or former employee, officer or
director of either of Parent or any Parent Affiliate to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due any such employee, officer or director or (C)
constitute a "change of control" under any Parent Benefit Plan, and Parent
and its Board of Directors have taken all required actions to effect the
foregoing.   (x) To the knowledge of Parent, Parent and each
Parent Affiliate are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable laws relating to employment, employment practices and wage and
hours laws.   (i) TAXES.   (i) Each of Parent and its subsidiaries has
filed all material tax returns and reports required to be filed by it and all
such returns and reports are complete and correct in all material respects,
or requests for extensions to file such returns or reports have been timely
filed, granted and have not expired, except to the extent that such failures
to file, to be complete or correct or to have extensions granted that remain
in effect individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse
effect on Parent. Parent and each of its subsidiaries has paid (or Parent has
paid on its behalf) all taxes shown as due on such returns, and the most
recent financial statements contained in the Parent SEC Documents filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (as amended to the
date of this Agreement, the "Parent Filed SEC Documents") reflect an adequate
reserve for all taxes payable by Parent and its subsidiaries for all taxable
periods and portions thereof accrued through the date of such financial
statements.   (ii) No deficiencies for any taxes have been
proposed, asserted or assessed against Parent or any of its subsidiaries that
are not adequately reserved for, except for deficiencies that individually or
in the aggregate would not have a material adverse effect on Parent.  
(iii) Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has taken any action or
knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is reasonably
likely to prevent the Mergers from qualifying as reorganizations within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.   (iv) Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution of stock qualifying for tax-free treatment

"plan" or "series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section
355(e) of the Code in conjunction with the Mergers.    31.    (v)

tax law).   (vi) Neither Parent or any of its subsidiaries (i) has
ever been a member of an affiliated group (within the meaning of Section
1504(a) of the Code) filing a consolidated federal income tax return (other

liability for the taxes of any person (other than Parent or any of its
subsidiaries) under Section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or
successor, or otherwise. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by any tax indemnity agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax
allocation agreement or similar contract pursuant to which Parent or any its
subsidiaries could be liable for Taxes of any person after the Effective Time
(other than Parent or any of its subsidiaries).   (j) STATE TAKEOVER
STATUTES. The Board of Directors of Parent has approved the terms of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers, the issuance of Parent Common
Stock upon the conversion of the Bridge Preferred Stock as provided in
paragraph 5(b) of the Bridge Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and such approval constitutes
approval of the Mergers, such conversion and the other

its subsidiaries (i) are in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws and (ii) possess all permits and other
Governmental Authorizations required under applicable Environmental Laws, and

TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time:   (a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Target
Companies;   (b) by either Parent or the Target Companies if the Mergers

that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.01(b)
shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement results in the failure of the Mergers to be
consummated by such time;   (c) by either Parent or the Target Companies if
a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have
issued a final and nonappealable order, decree or ruling, or shall have taken
any other action, having the effect of permanently enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting either of the Mergers;   (d) by Parent if (i) any of the Target

Companies\' covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached
such that the condition set forth in Section 6.01(b) would not be satisfied;
provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of the Target Companies\'
representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date of this
Agreement or a breach of a covenant by the Target Companies is curable by the
Target Companies within 20 days after notice of such breach and the Target
Companies are continuing to exercise all reasonable efforts to cure such
inaccuracy or breach, then Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.01(d) on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such breach is
continuing for a period of 20 days after notice of such breach; or   (e) by
the Target Companies if (i) any of Parent\'s representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(a) would not be
satisfied, or (ii) if any of Parent\'s covenants contained in this Agreement
shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section 6.02(b)
would not be satisfied; provided, however, that if an inaccuracy in any of
Parent\'s representations and warranties as of a date subsequent to the date
of this Agreement or a breach of a covenant by Parent is curable by
Parent within 20 days after notice of such breach and Parent is continuing to
exercise all reasonable efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach, then   
50.  the Target Companies may not terminate this Agreement under this
Section 7.01(e) on account of such inaccuracy or breach unless such breach is
continuing for a period of 20 days after notice of such breach.   SECTION
7.02 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
the Target Companies or Parent as provided in Section 7.01, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or
obligation on the part of Parent, the Merger Subs, the Target
Companies, other than the last sentence of Section 5.04, this Section 7.02
and Article VIII, which provisions survive such termination; provided,
however, that nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability for
any willful and material breach by such party of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that (i) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(e), (ii)
prior to such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 6.01 had been
satisfied, and (iii) prior to such termination, Parent and/or one of the
Merger Subs shall have failed or refused to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, such failure or refusal shall constitute a willful and
material breach of this Agreement by Parent (a "Terminating Parent Breach").
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or Section 7.01(d), (ii) prior to
such termination, the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 had been
satisfied, and (iii) prior to such termination, the Target Companies shall
have failed or refused to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
such failure or refusal shall constitute a willful and material of this
Agreement by the Target Companies. In the event of a Terminating Parent
Breach resulting directly or indirectly from or arising directly or
indirectly out of the failure of Parent to obtain the financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter or the failure of the conditions precedent to such
financing set forth in the Commitment Letter to be satisfied, (i)
Parent shall pay to the Holder Representative (or to the Target Companies in
such proportion as is designated in writing by the Holder Representative),
within five (5) Business Days of the date of such termination of this
Agreement, $2,000,000 in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the Holder Representative, as
liquidated damages for such Terminating Parent Breach and (ii) such Payment
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for such Terminating Parent
Breach.   SECTION 7.03 PROCEDURE FOR TERMINATION. A termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01 shall, in order to be effective, require,
in the case of Parent or either of the Target Companies, action by its Board
of Directors or, with respect to any amendment to this Agreement, the duly
authorized committee of its Board of Directors to the extent permitted by
law.   ARTICLE VIII   INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.   SECTION 8.01 SURVIVAL OF
REPRESENTATIONS, ETC.   (a) The representations and warranties made by the
Target Companies (including the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3 and the representations and warranties set forth in the Target
Companies Closing Certificate) shall survive the Closing and   
51.   shall expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, any Indemnitee (as defined in Section 10.02) (acting in good faith)
delivers to the Holder Representative a written notice alleging the existence
of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by the Target Companies (and setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for such Indemnitee\'s belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may
exist) and asserting a claim for recovery under Section 8.02 based on such
alleged inaccuracy or breach (a "Claim Notice"), then the claim asserted in
such Claim Notice shall survive the first anniversary of the Closing until
such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.   (b) The
representations and warranties made by Parent in Sections 3.02(a), (c), (d),
(e), (f)(i) and (k) and in the Parent Closing Certificate solely with respect
to such sections shall survive the Closing and shall expire on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however, that if, at any time
prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, any Indemnitee
(as defined in Section 10.02) (acting in good faith) delivers to Parent a
Claim Notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of
the representations and warranties made by Parent in Sections 3.02(a), (c),
(d), (e), (f)(i) and (k) (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such Indemnitee\'s belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist)
and asserting a claim for recovery under Section 8.04 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such Claim Notice shall
survive the first anniversary of the Closing until such time as such claim is
fully and finally resolved. All other representations and warranties made by
Parent and the Merger Subs shall terminate and expire as of the Effective
Time, and any liability of Parent or the Merger Subs with respect to all such
representations and warranties (other than Sections 3.02(a), (c), (d), (e),
(f)(i) and (k)) shall thereupon cease.   SECTION 8.02 INDEMNIFICATION BY
SELLERS. From and after the Effective Time (but subject to Section 8.01(a)),
the Parent Indemnitees may seek indemnification to the fullest extent
permitted by law solely from the Stock Escrow Fund (as defined in the Escrow
Agreement) for any Damages that are suffered or incurred by any of the Parent
Indemnitees or to which any of the Parent Indemnitees may otherwise become
subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any third-party
claim) and which arise from or as a result of: (a) any inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.01 or in the
Target Companies Closing Certificate, in the case of any representation or
warranty qualified by "material adverse effect," or any material inaccuracy
in, or breach of, any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.01 or
in the Target Company Closing Certificate, in the case of any representation
or warranty not qualified by "material adverse effect"; (b) any breach of any
covenant or obligation of the Target Companies; or (c) the exercise by any
holder of Target Companies Common Stock of such holder\'s appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL which results in such Dissenting Stockholder
receiving an amount per share in excess of the Merger Consideration per share
of Target Companies Common Stock (in which case the Parent Indemnitees shall
be entitled to receive the difference between (A) the amount paid to
such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the appraisal proceedings and (B) the
product of (1) the Merger Consideration per share of Target Companies Common
Stock and (2) the total number of Dissenting Shares subject to such
appraisal proceedings).   SECTION 8.03 THRESHOLD FOR PARENT INDEMNITEES.
The Parent Indemnitees shall not be entitled to seek any indemnification
payment pursuant to Section 8.02 for any inaccuracy in or   
52.   breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.01 or the Target Companies Closing Certificate until such time as
the total amount of all Damages that have been suffered or incurred by any
one or more of the Parent Indemnitees and for which the Parent Indemnitees
would otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02(a),
exceeds $3,000,000 in the aggregate (the "Damages Threshold"), at which point
the Parent Indemnitees shall, subject to the last sentence of this Section
8.03, be entitled to recover the total amount of all Damages; provided,
however, that the Damages Threshold shall not apply to any Damages arising
from claims made pursuant to Section 8.02(c) above and Parent shall be
entitled to recover the entire amount of any Damages related to any claim
made therein, and any amount recovered under Section 8.02(c) shall not be
included for purposes of determining whether the Damages Threshold has been
reached. In no event shall the aggregate amount of Damages for which
Parent Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification exceed
$20,000,000.   SECTION 8.04 INDEMNIFICATION BY PARENT. From and after the
Effective Time (but subject to Section 8.01(b)), Parent shall indemnify,
defend and hold the Seller Indemnitees harmless to the fullest extent
permitted by law for any Damages that are suffered or incurred by any of the
Seller Indemnitees or to which any of the Seller Indemnitees may otherwise
become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to any
third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of: (i) any inaccuracy
in, or breach of, any representation or warranty set forth in Sections
3.02(a), (c), (d), (e), (f)(i) and (k) or in the Parent Closing Certificate
with respect to such sections, in the case of any representation or warranty
qualified by "material adverse effect," or any material inaccuracy in, or
breach of, any representation or warranty set forth in Sections 3.02(a), (c),
(d), (e), (f)(i) and (k) or in the Parent Closing Certificate with respect to
such sections, in the case of any representation or warranty not qualified by
"material adverse effect"; or (ii) any breach of any covenant or obligation
of Parent.   SECTION 8.05 THRESHOLD FOR SELLER INDEMNITEES. The Seller
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to seek any indemnification payment
pursuant to Section 8.04 for any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.02(a), (c), (d), (e),
(f)(i) and (k) until such time as the total amount of all Damages that have
been suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Seller Indemnitees and
for which the Seller Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.04, exceeds $3,000,000 in the
aggregate, at which point the Seller Indemnitees shall, subject to the last
sentence of this Section 8.05, be entitled to recover the total amount of all
Damages. In no event shall the aggregate amount of Damages for which Seller
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification exceed $20,000,000.  
SECTION 8.06 EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. From and after the Closing, recourse of Parent
to the Escrow Stock Fund (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and
the other Parent Indemnitees (or any person claiming by or through them) for
damages for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or other obligation contained in this Agreement.   SECTION 8.07
CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. The rights of the Indemnitees to indemnification under
Section 8.02 or 8.04, as applicable, constitutes the sole and exclusive
remedy of such Indemnitees following the Closing for any breach or violation
of, or default under, the terms of this Agreement. Except for any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.04, as applicable,
no Indemnitee shall assert or bring any claim for indemnification following
the    53.   Closing for any breach or violation of, or default under,
the terms of this Agreement, or otherwise assert against any party any suit,
claim or allegation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. No Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.04, as applicable, unless such
Indemnitee asserts such claim for indemnification prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date by providing written notice of such claim to
the Holder Representative, in the case of a Parent Indemnitee, or Parent, in
the case of a Seller Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, all Damages shall be
calculated after giving effect to any related Tax Benefit and net of any
related reserves and amount received from third parties, including without
limitation insurance proceeds recovered under insurance policies with respect
to any indemnifiable Damages.   SECTION 8.08 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. If
any claim, action, suit or proceeding covered by the foregoing agreements to
indemnify and hold harmless (a "Proceeding") shall arise, the Indemnitee
seeking indemnification shall give written notice thereof to the Holder
Representative, in the case of a Parent Indemnitee, or to Parent, in the case
of a Seller Indemnitee (the "Indemnitor"), promptly, but in any event within
ten days, after the Indemnitee learns of the existence of such Proceeding;
provided, however, that the Indemnitee\'s failure to give the Indemnitor
prompt notice shall not release the Indemnitor except to the extent such
party is prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall describe the claim in
reasonable detail and include copies of all related notices and documents
(including court papers) served on or received by the Indemnitee.
The Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in such claim or action,
to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee, and to compromise, settle or otherwise dispose of the same, if
the Indemnitor deems it advisable to do so, all at the expense of the
Indemnitor; provided that, Indemnitor shall not, without the consent of the
Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
settle, or consent to entry of any judgment in any Proceeding (i) without
obtaining a release of the Indemnitee from, or acknowledging its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnitee for, all Damages in respect of the claims
underlying such Proceeding, and (ii) where the sole relief provided in
connection with such settlement, consent or judgment is monetary damages.
Notwithstanding the assumption of the defense of any Proceeding by an
Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate (at its own
expense) in such Proceeding. After notice to the Indemnitee of
the Indemnitor\'s election to assume the defense of such claim or action,
the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the
defense thereof. The parties will fully cooperate in any such action, and
shall make available to each other any books or records useful for the
defense of any such Proceeding. If the Indemnitor fails to assume the defense
of such Proceeding within thirty (30) days after receiving notice thereof
from the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall have the right to undertake the
defense and settlement of any such Proceeding, at the Indemnitor\'s expense;
provided that, if the Indemnitee assumes the defense of any such Proceeding,
(x) the Indemnitee shall not settle such Proceeding prior to final judgment
thereon or forego any appeal with respect thereto without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld)
and (y) if such Indemnitee is a Parent Indemnitee, the costs of such defense
by such Parent Indemnitee will be funded from the Stock Escrow Fund.  
SECTION 8.09 EXERCISE OF REMEDIES BY INDEMNITEES. No Parent Indemnitee (other
than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be permitted to
assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless Parent (or any successor thereto    54.  or assign
thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such indemnification claim
or the exercise of such other remedy. No Seller Indemnitee shall be permitted
to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this
Agreement unless the Holder Representative (or any successor thereto
or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.   SECTION 8.10

new Holder Representative.   SECTION 9.02 AUTHORITY AND RIGHTS OF HOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE; LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY. The Holder Representative shall

Holder Representative, except with respect to the Holder Representative\'s
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative will at all
times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the Majority
Holders; provided, however, that the Holder Representative shall not be
required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as Holder Representative, unless the Holder
Representative has been provided with funds, security or indemnities which,
in the sole determination of the Holder Representative, are sufficient
to protect the Holder Representative against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred by the Holder Representative in responding
to such direction or taking such action. The Holder Representative shall be
entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents and consultants as
it shall deem    55.   necessary in connection with exercising its

rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Holder Representative
shall be entitled to reimbursement, from funds paid to it under Section 2.05
of this Agreement and/or otherwise received by it in its capacity as Holder
Representative pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement, for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity, and for

Corporation 100 California Street, Suite 500 San Francisco, CA
94111-4529  Ladies and Gentlemen:   The undersigned has been advised that
as of the date of this letter he or she may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of
URS Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("URS"), within the meaning of Rule
145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of July 16, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Universe

the meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.   As a result of the
Mergers, the undersigned may receive shares of Common Stock of Universe,
shares of Series D Preferred Stock of Universe and/or shares of Series E
Preferred Stock of Universe (the "Universe Shares") in exchange for shares of
common stock of Eagle and/or shares of common stock of Lear ("Target Shares")
owned by the undersigned. If in fact the undersigned is an "affiliate" of URS
under the Act, the undersigned\'s ability to sell, exchange, pledge, assign,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of URS Shares received by the undersigned in
the Mergers may be restricted, unless such transaction is registered under
the Act or an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned
understands that such exemptions are limited, and, to the extent necessary,
the undersigned has obtained advice of counsel as to the nature
and conditions of such exemptions, including information with respect to
the applicability to the sale of such URS Shares of Rules 144 and 145(d)
promulgated under the Act. The undersigned understands that URS will not be
required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement under
the Act for the purposes of resale of URS Securities by the undersigned,
other than pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined in the
Merger Agreement), provided that, so long as the restrictions described in
this letter are in effect, URS shall use its reasonable best efforts to meet
the requirements of paragraph (c) of Rule 144 promulgated under the Act.
Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on the part of
the undersigned that he or she is an "affiliate" of URS.   The undersigned
hereby represents to and covenants with URS that the undersigned will not
sell, exchange, pledge, assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any URS
Shares received by the undersigned in the Mergers, except (i) pursuant to an
effective Registration Statement under the Act, or (ii) in a transaction
which is not required to be registered under the Act or under
Rule 145.     The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the legend set
forth below will be placed on certificates representing URS Shares received
by the undersigned in connection with the Mergers or held by a transferee of
the undersigned, which legends will be removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such legends (i) if a sale of URS Shares is
effected in compliance with Rule 145(d)(1); (ii) if one year shall have
elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired URS Shares in the Mergers and
the undersigned provides evidence reasonably acceptable to URS that the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to the undersigned; (iii) if
two years shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired URS
Shares in the Mergers and the undersigned provides evidence reasonably
acceptable to URS that the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available to
the undersigned or (iv) upon receipt of an opinion in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to URS from counsel reasonably satisfactory to URS to
the effect that such legends are no longer required for purposes of the Act,
or (v) upon receipt of a "no action" letter obtained by the undersigned from
the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Subject to removal
pursuant to the preceding paragraph, there will be placed on the certificates
for URS Shares issued to the undersigned, or any substitutions therefor, a
legend stating in substance:   "The shares represented by this certificate
were issued in a  transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of  1933 (the "Securities Act") applies. The shares have not
been  acquired by the holder with a view to, or for resale in connection 
with, any distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities  Act. The
shares may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred  except (i) pursuant
to an effective registration under the Securities  Act, (ii) in conformity
with the volume and other limitations of Rule  145 or (iii) in accordance
with an exemption from the registration  requirements of the Securities
Act."   The undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has
carefully read this letter and understands the requirements hereof and the
limitations imposed upon the sale, exchange, pledge, assignment, transfer, or
other disposition of URS Securities, and (ii) the receipt by the URS of this
letter prior to the closing of the Mergers is an inducement to URS
consummating the Mergers.   The agreement evidenced by this letter shall be
binding upon the undersigned and the undersigned\'s successors and assigns,
and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the
State of California.   [This Space Intentionally Left Blank]     IN

Title:  ------------------------------    Exhibit A to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger    ESCROW AGREEMENT    THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (the
"AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of ______________, 2002, by and
among: URS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"); URS HOLDINGS,
INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; URS-LSS
HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent (together with URS Holdings, Inc, the "MERGER SUBS"); EGandG; TECHNICAL
SERVICES HOLDINGS, L.L.C., as the Holder Representative (the "HOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE"); and STATE STREET BANK AND TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA,
N.A., a national banking association (the "ESCROW AGENT"). Capitalized terms
used in this Agreement and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
given to them in the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is
attached hereto.    RECITALS   A. Parent, the Merger Subs, Carlyle-EGandG;
Holdings Corp., (a "TARGET COMPANY"), Lear Siegler Services, Inc. (a "TARGET
COMPANY" and, together with Carlyle-EGandG; Holdings Corp., the "TARGET
COMPANIES"), and the Holder Representative have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of July 16, 2002 (the "MERGER
AGREEMENT"), pursuant to which the Target Companies will merge with and into
the Merger Subs, and the stockholders of the Target Companies as of the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) (the "TARGET
STOCKHOLDERS") will receive, among other consideration, cash and shares of
Series D Convertible Participating Preferred Stock of Parent (the "BRIDGE
PREFERRED").   B. The Merger Agreement contemplates the establishment of an
escrow arrangement to (i) allow for adjustments to the Cash Merger
Consideration resulting from any differences between the Estimated Net Debt
at Closing and the Final Net Debt at Closing as set forth in Section 2.02 of
the Merger Agreement and (ii) secure the indemnification rights of the Parent
Indemnitees under Article VIII of the Merger Agreement.   C. Pursuant to
Section 9.01 of the Merger Agreement, EGandG; Technical Services Holdings,
L.L.C. has been designated the Holder Representative for, among other things,
certain matters set forth in Articles VIII and IX of the Merger
Agreement.   AGREEMENT   The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:   1. ESCROW FUNDS.   (a) ESCROWED CASH. Immediately following
the Closing, Parent shall deposit with the Escrow Agent, in immediately
available funds, $5,000,000 (the "CASH ESCROW FUND"), to be held in escrow
and invested by the Escrow Agent as provided in this Agreement. The Cash
Escrow Fund shall be used only in connection with adjusting the Cash Merger
Consideration as a result of differences between the Estimated Net Debt at
Closing and the Final Net Debt at Closing as set forth in Section 2.02 of the
Merger Agreement.     1.   (b) ESCROWED SHARES. Immediately following
the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate or
certificates for shares of Bridge Preferred with an aggregate Liquidation
Preference (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of $20,000,000 (determined as
set forth in Section 2.01(e) of the Merger Agreement) (the "STOCK ESCROW
FUND"), to be registered in the name of Embassy and Co. as nominee of the
Escrow Agent and held in escrow by the Escrow Agent as provided in this
Agreement. The Cash Escrow Fund and the Stock Escrow Fund shall be known
collectively as the "ESCROW FUNDS." The shares of Bridge Preferred being held
in the Stock Escrow Fund shall be referred to as the "ESCROW SHARES". The
Escrow Funds shall be held as trust funds and shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any Target Stockholder or of any party hereto. The Escrow Agent
agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow Funds and to hold each of the
Cash Escrow Fund and the Stock Escrow Fund in a separate escrow
account (collectively, the "ESCROW ACCOUNTS") subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.   (c) VOTING OF ESCROW SHARES. The Escrow
Agent shall cause to be voted all of the Escrow Shares in the Stock Escrow
Fund as to which it receives written instructions from the Target
Stockholders whose Escrow Shares have been deposited into the Stock Escrow
Fund in accordance with such instructions. The Escrow Agent shall rely upon
the number of Escrow Shares set forth next to the name of each Target
Stockholder on Exhibit A (as such Exhibit is revised from time to time by the
written direction of Parent and the Holder Representative) hereto in
determining how many shares of Escrow Shares a Target Stockholder
has authority to cause the Escrow Agent to cause to be voted. In the absence
of written directions from a Target Stockholder as to how Escrow
Shares attributable to such Target Stockholder are to be voted, the Escrow
Agent need not vote such shares. The Escrow Agent need not deliver proxy
statements or other documents it may receive from Parent or any other person
on behalf of Parent to the Target Stockholders.   (d) DIVIDENDS, ETC. Any
cash, securities or other property paid, whether by way of dividend or
otherwise (other than shares distributed pursuant to a stock split), in
respect of any Escrow Shares shall be distributed to the Target Stockholders
in accordance with their ownership of such Escrow Shares as provided on
Exhibit A. Any cash, securities or other property paid in exchange for any
Escrow Shares shall not be distributed to the Target Stockholders, but rather
shall be distributed to and held by the Escrow Agent in the Stock
Escrow Fund. Unless and until the Escrow Agent shall actually receive such
cash, securities or other property, it may assume without inquiry that the
Escrow Shares currently being held by it in the Stock Escrow Fund are all
that the Escrow Agent is required to hold in such account. At the time any
Escrow Shares are released from the Stock Escrow Fund to any Person pursuant
to this Agreement, any cash, securities or other property previously received
by the Escrow Agent in exchange for such Escrow Shares or shares distributed
pursuant to a stock split of Escrow Shares shall be released from the Stock
Escrow Fund to such Person.   (e) CONVERSION OF BRIDGE PREFERRED. Upon
conversion of any of the Escrow Shares into shares of Parent Common Stock or
Series E Senior Cumulative Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the
"SERIES E PREFERRED"), such shares of Common Stock or Series E Preferred
Stock will be deemed to be "ESCROW SHARES" and will be governed by this
Agreement in all respects. The Escrow Agent, as registered owner of the
Escrow Shares, shall elect to convert Bridge Preferred held as Escrow Shares
into either Parent Common Stock or     2.  Series E Preferred upon the
written direction of a Target Stockholder, to which written direction shall
be attached the execution versions of documents required to be delivered to
Parent to effect such conversion. Upon such conversion, Parent shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent, in exchange for the applicable number of shares of
Bridge Preferred, (i) the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
or Series E Preferred, as applicable, and (ii) a revised version of Exhibit
A, showing the correct allocation among the Target Stockholders of Bridge
Preferred, Parent Common Stock and Series E Preferred being held as Escrow
Shares. At any time, the Escrow Agent may assume that the most recent version
of Exhibit A it has received correctly states the numbers and types of Escrow
Shares it is required to hold in the Escrow Funds. At any one time,
there will be only one class of stock outstanding constituting Escrow
Shares.   (f) NOTICE OF TRANSFER. No transfer of any interests of
the Target Stockholders in the Escrow Accounts or the Escrow Shares shall
be recognized or given effect until Parent and the Escrow Agent shall have
received written notice of such transfer.   (g) FRACTIONAL SHARES. No
fractional shares of the Escrow Shares shall be retained in or released from
the Escrow pursuant to this Agreement. In connection with any release of
Escrow Shares from the Stock Escrow Fund, Parent and the Escrow Agent shall
"round down" in order to avoid retaining any fractional share in the Stock
Escrow Fund and in order to avoid releasing any fractional share from the
Stock Escrow Fund. When shares are "rounded down", cash-in-lieu payments
shall be made to the appropriate Target Stockholder, and Parent shall provide
the cash required to make such payments to the Escrow Agent.   2.
ADMINISTRATION OF CASH ESCROW FUND. Upon final determination of the Final Net
Debt at Closing in accordance with Sections 2.02(c) and (d) of the Merger
Agreement, each of Parent and the Holder Representative shall execute joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent
to disburse the Cash Escrow Fund as follows:   (a) FINAL NET DEBT AT
CLOSING LESS THAN ESTIMATED NET DEBT AT CLOSING. If the Estimated Net Debt at
Closing exceeds the Final Net Debt at Closing, then, promptly following the
date on which the Escrow Agent receives such written instructions (the
"NOTIFICATION DATE"), and in any event within five (5) business days of the
Notification Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Target
Stockholders the Cash Escrow Fund (together with all interest earned thereon)
pro rata based on the percentage interests in the Cash Escrow Fund set forth
on Exhibit A then in effect.   (b) FINAL NET DEBT AT CLOSING MORE THAN
ESTIMATED NET DEBT AT CLOSING. If the Final Net Debt at Closing exceeds the
Estimated Net Debt at Closing, then, promptly following the Notification
Date, and in any event within five (5) business days of the Notification
Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Parent from the Cash Escrow Fund the
amount by which the Final Net Debt at Closing exceeds the Estimated Net Debt
at Closing, together with all interest earned on such amount. Any remaining
cash in the Cash Escrow Fund (together with all interest earned on such
amount) shall be distributed to the Target Stockholders pro rata based on the
percentage interests in the Cash Escrow Fund set forth on Exhibit A then in
effect.   3. ADMINISTRATION OF STOCK ESCROW FUND. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Escrow Agent shall administer the Stock Escrow Fund as
follows:     3.   (a) If any Parent Indemnitee has or claims to have
incurred or suffered Losses for which it is or may be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Article VIII of the
Merger Agreement, Parent may, on or prior to the Stock Escrow Fund
Termination Date (defined below), deliver a written notice of claim (a "CLAIM
NOTICE") to the Escrow Agent and the Holder Representative. Each Claim Notice
shall state that such Parent Indemnitee believes that there is or has been a
breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of either of the
Target Companies contained in the Merger Agreement or closing certificates
delivered in connection therewith. Each Claim Notice also shall specifically
allege the inaccuracy or breach of a specific representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation for a claim made pursuant to Article VIII of the
Merger Agreement and shall contain a reasonable description of the
circumstances supporting such Parent Indemnitee\'s belief that there is
or has been such a breach or that such Parent Indemnitee is or may be so
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement and shall, to the
extent possible, contain a non-binding, preliminary good faith estimate of
the amount of the Damages such Parent Indemnitee claims to have so incurred
or suffered and for which such Parent Indemnitee believes it is or may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VIII of the Merger Agreement
(the "CLAIMED AMOUNT").   (b) Within 20 business days after receipt by the
Escrow Agent of a Claim Notice, the Holder Representative may deliver to
Parent, to the Parent Indemnitee who delivered the Claim Notice and to the
Escrow Agent a written response (the "RESPONSE NOTICE") in which the Holder
Representative: (i) agrees that a whole number of Escrow Shares having a
"MARKET VALUE" (as defined below) equal to the full Claimed Amount may be
released from the Stock Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnitee; (ii) agrees
that a whole number of Escrow Shares having a Market Value equal to an amount
less than the Claimed Amount (the "AGREED AMOUNT") may be released from the
Stock Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part
of the Claimed Amount may be released from the Stock Escrow Fund to the
Parent Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed Amount that is not to be released
to the Parent Indemnitee shall be the "CONTESTED AMOUNT." If a Response
Notice is not received by the Escrow Agent within such 20 business day
period, then the Holder Representative shall be deemed to have agreed that
a whole number of Escrow Shares having a Market Value equal to the full
Claimed Amount may be released from the Stock Escrow Fund.   (c) If the
Holder Representative delivers a Response Notice agreeing that Escrow Shares
having a Market Value equal to the full Claimed Amount may be released from
the Stock Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnitee, or if the Holder
Representative does not deliver a Response Notice in accordance with Section
3(b) above, the Escrow Agent shall, promptly following the receipt of the
Response Notice (or, if the Escrow Agent has not received a Response Notice,
promptly following the expiration of the 20 business day period referred to
in Section 3(b) above) and subject to Section 3(h) below, deliver to
such Parent Indemnitee such Escrow Shares.   (d) If the Holder
Representative delivers a Response Notice agreeing that Escrow Shares having
a Market Value equal to the Agreed Amount may be released from the Stock
Escrow Fund to the Parent Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, promptly
following the receipt of the Response Notice and subject to Section 3(h)
below, deliver to such Parent Indemnitee such Escrow Shares.     4.  
(e) If the Holder Representative delivers a Response Notice indicating that
there is a Contested Amount, the Holder Representative and the Parent
Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the
Contested Amount. If the Parent Indemnitee and the Holder
Representative shall resolve such dispute, such resolution shall be binding
on the Parent Indemnitee and the Holder Representative and a settlement
agreement shall be signed by the Parent Indemnitee and the Holder
Representative and sent to the Escrow Agent, who shall, upon receipt thereof
and subject to Section 3(h) below, release Escrow Shares from the Stock
Escrow Fund in accordance with such agreement.   (f) If the Holder
Representative and the Parent Indemnitee are unable to resolve the dispute
relating to any Contested Amount within 30 business days after the delivery
of the Claim Notice, then the claim described in the Claim Notice shall be
settled by binding arbitration in the County of New Castle in the State of
Delaware in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect
of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA RULES"). Arbitration will
be conducted by three arbitrators: one selected by Parent, one selected by
the Holder Representative and the third selected by the first
two arbitrators. If the Holder Representative or Parent, as applicable, fails
to select an arbitrator within 10 calendar days following the expiration of
the 30-business day period referred to in the first sentence of this Section
3(f), then the party that has not failed to select an arbitrator shall be
entitled to select the second arbitrator. The parties agree to use all
reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be conducted within 60
calendar days after the appointment of the last of the three arbitrators and
to use all reasonable efforts to cause the arbitrators\' decision to be
furnished within 95 calendar days after the appointment of the last of the
three arbitrators. The parties further agree that discovery shall be
completed at least 20 business days prior to the date of the arbitration
hearing. The final decision of the arbitrators shall be furnished to the
Holder Representative, Parent, the Parent Indemnitee and the Escrow Agent in
writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issue in
question, binding upon the Target Stockholders, the Parent Indemnitee and the
Escrow Agent and shall not be contested by any of them. The non-prevailing
party in any arbitration shall pay the reasonable expenses (including
attorneys\' fees) of the prevailing party, any additional reasonable fees and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees) of the Escrow Agent, and the fees
and expenses associated with the arbitration (including the
arbitrators\' fees and expenses). For purposes of this Section 3(f), the non-
prevailing party shall be deemed to be the Parent Indemnitee if it is
entitled to recover no more than 50% of the Contested Amount; otherwise it
shall be the Target Stockholders.   (g) Subject to Section 3(h) below, the
Escrow Agent shall release Escrow Shares from the Stock Escrow Fund in
connection with any Contested Amount within five business days after the
delivery to it of, and in accordance with: (i) a copy of a settlement
agreement executed by the Parent Indemnitee and the Holder Representative
setting forth instructions to the Escrow Agent as to the number of Escrow
Shares, if any, to be released from the Stock Escrow Fund, with respect to
such Contested Amount; or (ii) a copy of the award of the
arbitrators referred to and as provided in Section 3(f) setting forth
instructions to the Escrow Agent as to the number of Escrow Shares, if any,
to be released from the Stock Escrow Fund, with respect to such Contested
Amount.   (h) The Escrow Agent shall not be entitled to release any
Escrow Shares from the Stock Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 3(a) hereof
until such time as the Claimed Amount to be released to the Parent
Indemnitees exceeds $3,000,000 (the "DAMAGES THRESHOLD") in the    
5.  aggregate; provided, however that such Damages Threshold shall not apply
to any Claimed Amount arising from claims made pursuant to Section 8.02(c) of
the Merger Agreement and any such amount released shall not be included for
purposes of determining whether the Claimed Amount released to the Parent
Indemnitees exceeds the Damages Threshold for purposes of this Section
3(h).   (i) The Stock Escrow Fund shall terminate 12 months from the
date hereof (the "STOCK ESCROW FUND TERMINATION DATE"); provided, however,
that if, on the date that is six months after the date hereof (the "EARLY
RELEASE DATE") no Claims Notices that have been delivered are then
outstanding, one-half of the Escrow Shares shall be released from the Stock
Escrow Fund to the Target Stockholders in accordance with the percentage
interests in the Stock Escrow Fund as specified on Exhibit A. In the event
that, on the Early Release Date, any Parent Indemnitee has given a Claim
Notice containing a claim which (i) has been resolved and amounts have been
paid out of the Stock Escrow Fund in accordance with this Section 3 (each, a
"PAID CLAIM") or (ii) has not been resolved prior to the Early Release Date
in accordance with this Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall release to the
Target Stockholders in accordance with the percentage interests in the Stock
Escrow Fund as specified on Exhibit A only that number of Escrow Shares with
a Market Value equal to one-half of the difference of (A) $20,000,000 less
(B) the number of Escrow Shares having a Market Value equal to the sum of
100% of all Paid Claims plus all Claimed Amounts (excluding paid amounts).
All Escrow Shares released pursuant to this Section 3(i) shall be released in
accordance with Section 4(c) below.   4. RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES.   (a)
The Escrow Agent is not the stock transfer agent for the Escrow Shares.
Accordingly, if a distribution of a number of Escrow Shares less than all of
the Escrow Shares held in the Stock Escrow Fund is to be made, the Escrow
Agent must requisition the appropriate number of shares from such
stock transfer agent, delivering to it the appropriate stock certificates.
For the purposes of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall be deemed to have
delivered Escrow Shares to the Person entitled to them when the Escrow Agent
has delivered such certificates to such stock transfer agent with
instructions to deliver it to the appropriate Person. Parent shall instruct
such stock transfer agent to act in accordance with such instructions of the
Escrow Agent. Distributions of Escrow Shares shall be made to the Target
Stockholders at the addresses set forth for such stockholders on Exhibit A
hereto. Whenever a distribution is to be made to the Target Stockholders, pro
rata distributions shall be made to each of them based on the percentage
interests in the Escrow Funds set forth on Exhibit A as then in effect.  
(b) Within five business days after the Stock Escrow Fund Termination Date,
the Escrow Agent shall distribute or cause the stock transfer agent for the
Escrow Shares to distribute to each of the Target Stockholders such Target
Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the Escrow Shares then held in escrow
based on the percentage interests in the Stock Escrow Funds set forth
in Exhibit A as then in effect; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, prior to the Stock Escrow Fund Termination Date, any
Parent Indemnitee has given a Claim Notice containing a claim which has not
been resolved prior to the Stock Escrow Fund Termination Date in accordance
with Section 3, the Escrow Agent shall retain in the Stock Escrow Fund Escrow
Shares having a Market Value equal to 100% of the Claimed Amount or Contested
Amount, as the case may be, with respect to all claims which have not then
been resolved until such claims are resolved.     6.   (c) Within five
business days after the Early Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute
or cause the stock transfer agent for the Escrow Shares to distribute to each
of the Target Stockholders such Target Stockholder\'s pro rata portion of the
Escrow Shares to be released from the Stock Escrow Fund as of the Early
Release Date as determined pursuant to Section 3(i) above, such pro rata
portion to be based on the percentage interests in the Stock Escrow Funds set
forth in Exhibit A as then in effect.   5. VALUATION OF ESCROW SHARES,
ETC.   (a) MARKET VALUE. For purposes of this Agreement, the "MARKET VALUE"
of (i) each share of Bridge Preferred or Series E Preferred Stock in
the Stock Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be equal to the product of (x)
the applicable Liquidation Preference (as defined in the applicable
certificate of designations) divided by the applicable Conversion Price (as
defined in the applicable certificate of designations) multiplied by (y) the
Parent Closing Stock Price, and (ii) each share of Parent Common Stock in the
Stock Escrow Fund shall be deemed to be equal to the Parent Closing Stock
Price. Before any distribution of Escrow Shares based on the Market Value of
such shares is required to be made by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Agreement, Parent and the Holder Representative shall determine the
appropriate Market Value for such shares and shall jointly notify the Escrow
Agent of such Market Value. Unless and until the Escrow Agent receives such
notice, it need not distribute Escrow Shares. In no event shall the Escrow
Agent be required to establish or to verify the Market Value of Escrow
Shares.   (b) SPLITS. All numbers contained in, and all
calculations required to be made pursuant to, this Agreement shall be
adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend or similar transaction effected by Parent after the date
hereof; provided, however, that the Escrow Agent shall have received notice
of such stock split or other action and shall have received the appropriate
number of additional shares of Escrow Shares pursuant to Section 1(d) hereof.
In the event of any such stock split or other similar occurrence, Parent
shall deliver to the Holder Representative and the Escrow Agent a revised
version of Exhibit A setting forth the new number of Escrow Shares held in
the Stock Escrow Fund. Unless and until the Escrow Agent receives the
certificates representing additional Escrow Shares, the Escrow Agent may
assume without inquiry that no such stock has been or is required to be
issued with respect to Escrow Shares.   (c) EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. From and after
the Closing, the Stock Escrow Fund (adjusted as appropriate to reflect any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction
effected by Parent after the date hereof) shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and the other Parent Indemnitees for damages for any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
obligation contained in the Merger Agreement.   6. FEES AND EXPENSES. Upon
the execution of this Agreement by all parties hereto and the initial deposit
of the Escrow Funds in the Escrow Accounts, fees and expenses, in accordance
with Exhibit B attached hereto, will be payable to the Escrow Agent. The
annual Escrow Agent fee will cover the first 12 months of the escrow. In
accordance with Exhibit B attached hereto, the Escrow Agent will also be
entitled to reimbursement for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses, including those of its counsel, incurred by the Escrow Agent in the
performance of its duties hereunder and the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. All such fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent.     7.  
7. LIMITATION OF ESCROW AGENT\'S LIABILITY.   (a) The Escrow Agent
undertakes to perform such duties as are specifically set forth in this
Agreement only and shall have no duty under any other agreement or document
notwithstanding their being referred to herein or attached hereto as an
exhibit. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable except for the performance of
such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement, and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability with respect to any action
taken by it or for any inaction on its part in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by it
to be genuine and duly authorized, nor for any other action or
inaction except for its own willful misconduct or negligence. In all
questions arising under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely on the
advice of counsel, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith
by the Escrow Agent based upon such advice the Escrow Agent shall not be
liable to anyone. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to take any action
hereunder involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is made or
provided for in a manner reasonably satisfactory to it. In no event shall the
Escrow Agent be liable for incidental, punitive or consequential damages.  
(b) Parent hereby agrees to indemnify the Escrow Agent for, and hold it
harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence
or willful misconduct on the part of Escrow Agent, arising out of or in
connection with its carrying out of its duties hereunder. This right
of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and
the resignation of the Escrow Agent. The costs and expenses of enforcing this
right of indemnification shall also be paid by Parent.   8. TERMINATION.
This Agreement shall terminate on the Stock Escrow Fund Termination Date;
provided, however, that if the Escrow Agent has received from any Parent
Indemnitee a Claim Notice in accordance with Section 3(a) hereof setting
forth a claim that has not been resolved by the Stock Escrow Fund Termination
Date, then this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
claim has been resolved and the Escrow Shares released in accordance with
this Agreement.   9. SUCCESSOR ESCROW AGENT. In the event the Escrow Agent
becomes unavailable or unwilling to continue as escrow agent under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to
this Agreement. Such resignation shall take effect not less than 30 calendar
days after it is given to all parties hereto. Parent may appoint a successor
Escrow Agent only with the consent of the Holder Representative (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The Escrow Agent
shall act in accordance with written instructions from Parent as to the
transfer of the Escrow Funds to a successor escrow agent. If a successor
Escrow Agent is not so appointed by Parent, the resigning Escrow Agent may
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint one.   10.
MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) ATTORNEYS\' FEES. If any action or proceeding relating
to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is
brought against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover reasonable attorneys\' fees, costs and disbursements    
8.  (in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be
entitled); provided that such amounts, together with the value of other
amounts released pursuant to Claim Notices, shall not exceed the aggregate
value of the Stock Escrow Fund.   (b) NOTICES. All notices, requests,

The undersigned represents that by reason of his or her or the Investor
Representative\'s business or financial experience, the undersigned has the

thereof shall be ratably distributed among the holders of Bridge Preferred
Stock and of any Parity Stock in proportion to the full amounts to which they

Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Bridge Preferred. If, upon any
such liquidation, distribution or winding up, the assets of the Company shall
be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders of Common Stock of
the amount set forth in this paragraph 4(c), then such assets shall be
distributed among the holders of Common Stock at the time outstanding,
ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be

liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the affairs of the
Corporation upon completion of the distributions and payments required by
paragraphs 4(a) and (c) and any other distributions and payments that may be
required with respect to any other series of preferred stock that may be

shares of Common Stock and Bridge Preferred Stock, pro rata based on the
number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder. For the purpose of
determining the number of shares of Common Stock held by each holder of
Bridge Preferred Stock, such holders shall be deemed to hold the number
of shares of Common Stock then issuable (assuming the occurrence of the
Required Stockholder Approval) upon conversion in full of all shares of
Bridge Preferred Stock held by such holder.   (e) Written notice of any
Liquidation Event, stating the payment date or dates when and the place where
the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be
given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to
any payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the shares of
Bridge Preferred Stock at their address as the same shall appear in the
records of the Corporation.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Certificate of Designations, each holder of Bridge Preferred Stock
will be entitled, in its sole discretion, to elect to treat as a Liquidation
Event any of the following transactions: any sale or disposition of the
Corporation to a third party not an Affiliate of the Corporation, whether by
merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation\'s
assets or sale of capital stock, provided that the stockholders of the
Corporation immediately prior to such sale or disposition (other than the
non-Affiliate third party) do not after such sale or disposition hold at
least 50% of the Common Stock of the Corporation (or the successor or
transferee entity, as the case may be) (any such transaction, an "Optional
Liquidation Event"). Notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the Corporation
not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days prior to any
Optional Liquidation Event, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to
all holders of record of the Bridge Preferred Stock at their respective
last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the Corporation (i)
describing in reasonable detail the contemplated Optional Liquidation Event,
including without limitation the consideration to be paid in connection with
such Optional Liquidation Event to the Corporation and/or its stockholders,
(ii) stating that such holder is entitled to treat the Optional Liquidation
Event as a Liquidation Event, (iii) stating the expected date of the Optional
Liquidation Event, (iv) stating the amount that would be payable on each
share of Bridge Preferred Stock in a Liquidation Event on such date, and (v)
stating the location in the United States where the holder must send notice
of its decision to elect to treat the Optional Liquidation Event as a
Liquidation Event. In order for the Optional Liquidation Event to be treated
as a Liquidation Event with respect to the Bridge Preferred Stock   
7.    held by any holder, such holder must, prior to such Optional
Liquidation Event, notify the Corporation at the location indicated in the
Corporation\'s notice that such holder elects to have the Corporation treat
the Optional Liquidation Event as a Liquidation Event with respect to its
shares of Bridge Preferred Stock and the number of shares such holder wishes
to have so treated. If any holder delivers to the Corporation such notice of
such holder\'s election to have the Optional Liquidation Event treated as a
Liquidation Event, such Optional Liquidation Event will be treated as a
Liquidation Event with respect to all shares of Bridge Preferred Stock with
respect to which such election was made, and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Certificate of Designations, the Corporation will make
distributions on such shares of Bridge Preferred Stock in accordance with
paragraphs 4(a) and, if applicable, 4(b) and 4(d) above.  5. Conversion
Rights.   (a) If the Required Stockholder Approval has not been obtained
prior to the Initial Conversion Date, then, from and after the Initial
Conversion Date and until such time as the Required Stockholder Approval is
obtained, at the election of the holders of at least a majority of the shares
of Bridge Preferred Stock then outstanding, each share of Bridge Preferred
Stock shall be converted, without any further action on the part of the
Corporation or any holder of Bridge Preferred Stock, into one (1) share of
Permanent Preferred Stock. Immediately following such conversion, the rights
of the holders of converted Bridge Preferred Stock shall cease and the
persons entitled to receive Permanent Preferred Stock upon the conversion of
Bridge Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the
owners of such Permanent Preferred Stock.   (b) Upon obtaining the Required
Stockholder Approval, each share of Bridge Preferred Stock not already
converted pursuant to paragraph 5(a) shall automatically be converted,
without any further action on the part of the Corporation or any holder of
Bridge Preferred Stock, into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
Liquidation Preference divided by the Conversion Price. Immediately following
such conversion, the rights of the holders of converted Bridge Preferred
Stock shall cease and the persons entitled to receive Common Stock upon the
conversion of Bridge Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as
having become the owners of such Common Stock.   (c) If the Bridge Preferred
Stock is converted pursuant to paragraph 5(a), such conversion shall be
effective for all purposes on the date the Corporation receives notice of
such election and if the Bridge Preferred Stock is converted automatically
pursuant to paragraph 5(b), such conversion shall be effective for all
purposes on the date that the Required Stockholder Approval is obtained
(in either case, the "Conversion Date"). Following the Conversion Date, the
holder of certificates formerly evidencing shares of Bridge Preferred Stock
shall (i) surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of
Bridge Preferred Stock to be converted, duly endorsed at the principal office
of the Corporation or transfer agent for the Bridge Preferred Stock, if any,
(ii) notify the Corporation in writing of the name or names in which such
holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock or
Permanent Preferred Stock, as applicable, to be issued and (iii) pay any
transfer or similar tax if required (provided, however, that no such payment
shall be required if the Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as
applicable, issuable upon conversion is to be issued in the name of the
converting holder of Bridge Preferred Stock). In the case of lost or
destroyed certificates formerly evidencing ownership of shares of Bridge
Preferred Stock to be surrendered, the holder shall submit such proof of loss
or destruction.    8.    The date on which the holder satisfies the
foregoing requirements is referred to as the "Delivery Date." As soon as
practicable after the Delivery Date, the Corporation shall deliver or shall
deliver through its transfer agent a certificate for the number of full
shares of Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as applicable, issuable
upon such conversion and a check for any fractional share. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, regardless of whether a holder shall have surrendered such
holder\'s certificates evidencing shares of Bridge Preferred Stock and/or
received in respect thereof certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock or
Permanent Preferred Stock, as applicable, such holder shall from and after
the Conversion Date be treated for all purposes as a record holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as applicable,
into which such holder\'s shares of Bridge Preferred Stock shall have been
converted until such time as record ownership is transferred and
the certificate held by such holder formerly representing ownership of shares
of Bridge Preferred Stock shall, until surrendered in exchange for new
certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock
as contemplated above, be deemed for all purposes to evidence the shares of
Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as applicable, issuable upon
conversion of the shares of Bridge Preferred Stock formerly held by such
holder. All shares of Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as
applicable, issuable upon conversion of the Bridge Preferred Stock shall be
fully paid and nonassessable. Holders of Common Stock issued upon conversion
pursuant to paragraph 5(b) shall not be entitled to receive any dividend
payable to holders of Common Stock as of any record time before the close of
business on the Conversion Date.   (d) The Corporation shall not issue a
fractional share of Common Stock upon conversion of Bridge Preferred Stock.
Instead, the Corporation shall deliver a check for an amount equal to the
value of the fractional share. The value of a fraction of a share is
determined by multiplying the Current Market Price of the Common Stock as of
the Conversion Date by the fraction, rounded to the nearest cent. If a holder
of Bridge Preferred Stock converts more than one share at a time the number
of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the
total number of all shares of Bridge Preferred Stock converted.   (e) A
holder delivering Bridge Preferred Stock for conversion will not be required
to pay any taxes or duties in respect of the issue or delivery of Common
Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, on conversion
but will be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of the shares of Common Stock
or Permanent Preferred Stock, as the case may be. Certificates representing
shares of Common Stock or Permanent Preferred Stock, as the case may be, will
not be issued or delivered unless all taxes and duties, if any, payable by
the holder have been paid.   (f) The Corporation has reserved and shall
continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its
Common Stock held in treasury and its Permanent Preferred Stock enough shares
of Common Stock and Permanent Preferred Stock to permit the conversion of the
Bridge Preferred Stock in full into either Common Stock or Permanent
Preferred Stock. All shares of Common Stock and Permanent Preferred Stock
issued upon conversion of Bridge Preferred Stock shall be fully paid and
nonassessable. The Corporation shall comply with all securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock and Permanent
Preferred Stock upon conversion of Bridge Preferred Stock and will list the
shares of Common Stock on each national securities exchange on which the
Common Stock is listed.    9.     (g) If the Corporation after the
Initial Issue Date:   (i) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its
Common Stock in  shares of its Common Stock;   (ii) subdivides its
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater  number of shares;  
(iii) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller  number
of shares; or   (iv) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any
shares of its  capital stock;  then the Conversion Price (as in effect
immediately prior to such action) shall proportionately be adjusted so that
the holder of Bridge Preferred Stock thereafter converted into Common Stock
may receive for the same aggregate Conversion Price the aggregate number and
kind of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that such holder would
have owned immediately following such action if such holder had converted
Bridge Preferred Stock immediately prior to such action (assuming the
occurrence of the Required Stockholder Approval). The adjustment shall become
effective immediately after the record date, in the case of a dividend or
distribution, and immediately after the effective date of a subdivision,
combination or reclassification. Such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever any event listed above shall occur. If, after an adjustment referred
to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a holder of Bridge Preferred Stock upon
conversion of such stock may receive shares of two or more classes of capital
stock of the Corporation, the Corporation shall determine (subject to
paragraph 5(m)) the allocation of the Conversion Price between the classes of
capital stock. After such allocation, the conversion rights and
the Conversion Price with respect to each class of capital stock shall
thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable
to Common Stock in this paragraph 5(g).   (h) In case of any consolidation,
amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into another
Person or any merger of another Person with or into the Corporation (other
than a transaction to which paragraph 5(g) applies), or in case of any sale
or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation,
subject to paragraph 4(f) above, each share of Bridge Preferred Stock then
outstanding shall, without the consent of the holder of any Bridge Preferred
Stock, become convertible only into the kind and amount of securities, cash
and other property receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or
transfer by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock (and
other securities, if applicable) into which such Bridge Preferred Stock
was convertible immediately prior thereto (assuming such holder of Common
Stock (and other securities, if applicable) failed to exercise any rights of
election and that the Required Stockholder Approval was obtained).
Concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, the corporation
formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other than the
Corporation, or the person to which such sale or conveyance shall have been
made, shall enter into a supplemental agreement so providing and further
providing for adjustments which shall be as equivalent as may be practicable
to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph.    10.     (i) For
purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to a
transaction described or contemplated by this paragraph 5, whenever this
Certificate of Designations calls for the determination of "fair market
value," such fair market value shall be determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors as evidenced by a written resolution thereof, subject to
the provisions of paragraph 5(m) below.   (j) The Corporation shall take no
action that would cause any adjustment under this paragraph 5 that would
reduce the Conversion Price below the par value of the Common Stock.   (k)
Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted, the Corporation shall promptly
mail to holders of Bridge Preferred Stock, first class, postage prepaid, a
notice of the adjustment and a certificate from the
Corporation\'s independent public accountants briefly stating the facts
requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. Subject to paragraph
5(l) below, the certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment
is correct.   (l) At least ten (10) days before any Change of Control, the
Corporation shall mail to all holders of Bridge Preferred Stock a notice,
first class, postage prepaid, stating the proposed record or effective date,
as the case may be with respect to such Change of Control.   (m) Except as
otherwise provided in this paragraph, any determination that the Corporation
or its Board of Directors must make pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be
conclusive. Whenever the Corporation or its Board of Directors shall
be required to make a determination under this paragraph 5, such
determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith
by the holders of a majority of the shares of Bridge Preferred Stock then
outstanding (with any shares held by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates
not being considered to be outstanding for purposes of this Certificate of
Designations), and any dispute shall be resolved, at the non-prevailing
party\'s expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized national
standing selected by the Corporation and reasonably acceptable to such
holders of a majority of the shares of Bridge Preferred Stock.   (n) All
shares of Bridge Preferred Stock converted pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall
be retired and shall be restored to the status of authorized and unissued
shares of preferred stock, without designation as to series and
may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred stock other
than Bridge Preferred Stock.   (o) The Corporation shall not avoid or seek
to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times in good faith
assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the
Bridge Preferred Stock against impairment.  6. Voting Rights.   In
addition to any voting rights provided by law, the holders of shares
of Bridge Preferred Stock shall have the following voting rights:   (a) On
any matter on which the holders of Bridge Preferred Stock are entitled by law
or pursuant to this Certificate of Designations to vote separately as a
class, each such holder    11.    shall be entitled to one vote for
each share held, and such matter shall be determined by a majority of the
votes cast unless the Delaware General Corporation Law or this Certificate of
Designations requires approval by a higher percentage. Such voting right of
the holders of the Bridge Preferred Stock may be exercised at any annual
meeting of stockholders, any special meeting of stockholders (including any
special meeting of holders of such series of stock), or by written consent of
the minimum number of shares required to take such action pursuant to Section
228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.   (b) During such time that
the aggregate number of shares of Bridge Preferred Stock outstanding is equal
to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Bridge Preferred Stock
outstanding on the Initial Issue Date (after giving effect to the issuance of
all shares of Bridge Preferred Stock issued on the Initial Issue Date), the
Corporation shall not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders
of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Bridge
Preferred Stock:   (i) amend, modify, alter, repeal or waive the application
of  (including by way of merger, consolidation, combination or otherwise)
any  provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the
Corporation  or any of its Subsidiaries in any manner that adversely affects
the powers,  rights, preferences or privileges of the holders of the Bridge
Preferred  Stock or the Permanent Preferred Stock, or enter into any
agreement or take  any other corporate action (or permit any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into  any agreement or take any corporate action) which
would in any way amend,  modify alter, repeal or waive the powers, rights,
preferences or privileges  of the Bridge Preferred Stock or the Permanent
Preferred Stock;   (ii) amend (including by way of merger, consolidation,
combination or  otherwise) in any respect this Certificate of Designations or
the Permanent  Preferred Certificate of Designations or subdivide, combine or
reclassify  the Bridge Preferred Stock or the Permanent Preferred Stock,
other than  changes in the name of the issuing corporation as contemplated by
paragraph  12;   (iii) create, authorize or issue (including on conversion
or exchange  of any convertible or exchangeable securities or by
reclassification)  shares of any class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation other  than (x) the issuance of shares of Permanent Preferred
Stock upon  conversion of the Bridge Preferred Stock and (y) the issuance of
shares of  Junior Stock;   (iv) permit any Subsidiary of the Corporation to
create, authorize or  issue (including on conversion or exchange of any
convertible or  exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any class or
series of  capital stock of such Subsidiary;   (v) redeem, acquire,
purchase, defease or otherwise retire for value  or make any other payment or
distribution in respect of any shares of  capital stock of the Corporation or
any Subsidiaries of the Corporation,  other than (a) any such redemption,
acquisition, purchase, retirement or  other payment or    12.    
distribution in respect of the Bridge Preferred Stock, (b) any redemption, 
acquisition, purchase, retirement or other payment or distribution by any 
Subsidiary of the Corporation in respect of shares of capital stock of such 
Subsidiary held by the Corporation or another wholly-owned Subsidiary of  the
Corporation, (c) to the extent permitted under the terms of the then 
outstanding Indebtedness of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the 
repurchase from terminated or retired employees of shares of Common Stock  or
options to purchase Common Stock, in each case, issued under any stock 
purchase or stock plans or other compensatory arrangements that are  approved
by the Board of Directors, and (d) the cashless exercise of  Options and the
surrender by holders of restricted shares of capital stock  of the
Corporation in payment of any tax liabilities by such holders  pursuant to
the Stock Plans;   (vi) take any action (or permit any Subsidiary of the

cash; or   (vii) declare or pay any dividends or make any other
distributions in  respect of Common Stock or any other class of Junior Stock

herein, the terms of this Certificate of Designations may be amended and the
rights hereunder may be waived only with the consent of holders of a majority
of the shares of the Bridge Preferred Stock then outstanding.  8. Headings
of Subdivisions. The headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any

and Designations. One hundred thousand (100,000) shares of the preferred
stock, $.01 par value per share, of the Corporation are hereby constituted as
a series of the preferred stock designated as Series E Senior Cumulative
Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the "Permanent
Preferred Stock").  3. Dividends.   (a) The record holders of Permanent
Preferred Stock as of the applicable Record Date shall be entitled to receive
cumulative per share dividends, when and as declared by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, out of funds legally available for payment of
dividends. Such dividends shall be payable by the Corporation in cash in
accordance with paragraph 3(b).   (b) Dividends on shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock shall be cumulative and shall accrue beginning on the Initial
Bridge Preferred Issue Date, regardless of when any such share of Permanent
Preferred Stock was issued, at the Dividend Rate. All or any portion of the
accrued but unpaid dividends shall be payable in arrears when and as declared
by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (each date as so declared a
"Dividend Payment Date"). If any Dividend Payment Date occurs on a day that
is not a Business Day, any accrued dividends otherwise payable on such
Dividend Payment Date shall be payable on the next succeeding Business Day.
To the extent declared by the Board of Directors of the Corporation,
dividends shall be payable to the holders of record of the Permanent
Preferred Stock as their names shall appear on the share register of the
Corporation on the Record Date for such dividend. Dividends on account of
arrears for any past Dividend Periods may be declared and paid at any time to
holders of record on the Record Date therefor. For any Dividend Period in
which accrued dividends are not paid in full on or prior to the end of
such Dividend Period, such accrued and unpaid dividends shall be added to
the Liquidation Preference of the Permanent Preferred Stock effective at
the commencement of the Dividend Period succeeding the Dividend Period as to
which such dividends were not paid and shall thereafter accrue additional
dividends in respect thereof at the Dividend Rate until such accrued and
unpaid dividends have been paid in full. Dividends payable on the Permanent
Preferred Stock will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of
twelve 30-day months and will be deemed to accrue and accumulate on a daily
basis.   (c) So long as any shares of Permanent Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the Corporation shall not declare, pay or set apart for
payment on any Parity Stock any dividends whatsoever (other than dividends
payable solely in shares of Parity Stock or Junior Stock), whether in cash,
property or otherwise, nor shall the Corporation make any distribution on any
Parity Stock, nor shall any Parity Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, nor shall any monies
be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption
of any Parity Stock, unless any dividends declared upon any other class or
series of Parity Stock shall be declared, and any monies paid or made
available for a sinking fund for the purchase or redemption of any class or
series of Parity Stock is paid or made available, ratably in proportion to
the respective amounts of dividends accumulated and unpaid on the Permanent
Preferred Stock and accumulated and unpaid on such Parity Stock.   
9     (d) So long as any shares of Permanent Preferred Stock shall
be outstanding, the Corporation shall not declare, pay or set apart for
payment on any Junior Stock any dividends whatsoever (other than dividends
payable solely in shares of Junior Stock), whether in cash, property or
otherwise, nor shall the Corporation make any distribution on any Junior
Stock, nor shall any Junior Stock be purchased, redeemed or otherwise
acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (except for
acquisitions of Common Stock by the Company pursuant to agreements in effect
on the date the Permanent Preferred Stock is initially issued or subsequently
approved by the Board of Directors which permit the Company to repurchase
such shares upon termination of services to the Company or any Subsidiary),
nor shall any monies be paid or made available for a sinking fund for the
purchase or redemption of any Junior Stock, unless all accrued but unpaid
dividends to which the holders of Permanent Preferred Stock are entitled
shall have been paid.   (e) In the event that the Corporation declares
and/or pays any dividend or other distribution on the Common Stock (other
than a dividend payable solely in shares of Common Stock), the Corporation
shall, at the time of such declaration and payment, declare and pay a
dividend or other distribution on the Permanent Preferred Stock consisting of
the dividend or distribution that would have been payable on the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Permanent Preferred Stock
(assuming the occurrence of the Required Stockholder Approval) if the
Permanent Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock immediately
prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution, or, if no such
record was taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock
entitled to such dividend or distribution were determined. Any such dividend
or distribution declared, or required to be declared or to be paid, on the
Permanent Preferred Stock shall be deemed accrued on the Permanent
Preferred Stock for all purposes of this Certificate of Designations and
shall remain an accrued dividend on the Permanent Preferred Stock for all
purposes of this Certificate of Designations until paid.   (f) Dividends on
the Permanent Preferred Stock shall accrue and accumulate daily and compound
quarterly whether or not the Corporation has earnings or profits, whether or
not there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends and
whether or not dividends are declared or paid.   (g) In the event that the
amount of any dividends on the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock declared
and actually paid or made available for payment to the holders of such shares
with respect to any Dividend Period is less than the full amount of the
dividend which accrued on such shares during such Dividend Period, then the
entire amount paid or made available for payment by the Corporation shall be
distributed ratably among all such holders of Permanent Preferred Stock in
proportion to the full amount to which they would otherwise respectively be
entitled.  4. Distributions Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  
(a) In the event of any Liquidation Event, (i) Permanent Preferred
Stock shall rank prior to all other classes and series of the Corporation\'s
capital stock authorized or outstanding on the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue
Date and (ii) before any payment or distribution of the assets of the
Corporation (whether capital or surplus), or any other consideration in
connection with such Liquidation Event, shall be made to or set apart for the
holders of Junior Stock, the    10    holders of Permanent Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation in
cash or property at its fair market value as reasonably determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation an amount per share equal
to the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued
and unpaid thereon from the beginning of the Dividend Period during which the
Liquidation Event occurs to the date of such Liquidation Event.   (b) If,
upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation shall be
insufficient to permit the payment in full of the Liquidation Preference per
share, plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon from
the beginning of the Dividend Period during which the Liquidation Event
occurs to the date of such Liquidation Event, as provided in paragraph 4(a)
above, and the full liquidating payments on all Parity Stock, then the assets
of the Corporation or the proceeds thereof shall be ratably distributed among
the holders of Permanent Preferred Stock and of any Parity Stock
in proportion to the full amounts to which they would otherwise be entitled
if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full.   (c) After the payment
of the full Liquidation Preference of the Permanent Preferred Stock as set
forth in paragraph 4(a) above, the holders of the Common Stock shall be
entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation an amount per share
of Common Stock equal to (i) the Liquidation Preference paid on behalf of a
share of Permanent Preferred Stock pursuant to paragraph 4(a) divided by (ii)
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of
Permanent Preferred Stock. If, upon any such Liquidation Event, the assets of
the Corporation shall be insufficient to make payment in full to all holders
of Common Stock of the amount set forth in this paragraph 4(c), then such
assets shall be distributed among the holders of Common Stock at the
time outstanding, ratably in proportion to the full amounts to which they
would otherwise be respectively entitled.   (d) In the event of any
Liquidation Event, upon completion of the distributions and payments required
by paragraphs 4(a) and (c) and any other distributions and payments that may
be required with respect to any other series of preferred stock that may be
authorized after the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date, the remaining
assets of the Corporation shall be distributed among the holders of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock and Permanent Preferred Stock, pro rata
based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder. For
the purpose of determining the number of shares of Common Stock held by each
holder of Permanent Preferred Stock, such holders shall be deemed to hold the
number of shares of Common Stock then issuable (assuming the occurrence of
the Required Stockholder Approval) upon conversion in full of all shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock held by such holder).   (e) Written notice of any
Liquidation Event, stating the payment date or dates when and the place where
the amounts distributable in such circumstances shall be payable, shall be
given by first class mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to
any payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of the shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock at their address as the same shall appear in the
records of the Corporation.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Certificate of Designations, each holder of Permanent Preferred Stock
will be entitled, in its sole discretion, to elect to treat as a Liquidation
Event any of the following transactions: any sale or disposition of the
Corporation to a third party not an Affiliate of the Corporation, whether by
merger, consolidation,    11    sale of all or substantially all of the
Corporation\'s assets or sale of capital stock, provided that the
stockholders of the Corporation immediately prior to such sale or disposition
(other than the non-Affiliate third party) do not after such sale or
disposition hold at least 50% of the Common Stock of the Corporation (or the
successor or transferee entity, as the case may be) (any such transaction, an
"Optional Liquidation Event"). Notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the
Corporation not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days
prior to any Optional Liquidation Event, by first class mail,
postage prepaid, to all holders of record of the Permanent Preferred Stock at
their respective last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the
Corporation (i) describing in reasonable detail the contemplated Optional
Liquidation Event, including without limitation the consideration to be paid
such Optional Liquidation Event to the Corporation and/or its stockholders,
(ii) stating that such holder is entitled to treat the Optional Liquidation
Event as a Liquidation Event, (iii) stating the expected date of the Optional
Liquidation Event, (iv) stating the amount that would be payable on each
share of Permanent Preferred Stock in a Liquidation Event on such date, and
(v) stating the location in the United States where the holder must send
notice of its decision to elect to treat the Optional Liquidation Event as a
Liquidation Event. In order for the Optional Liquidation Event to be treated
as a Liquidation Event with respect to the Permanent Preferred Stock held by
any holder, such holder must, prior to such Optional Liquidation Event,
notify the Corporation at the location indicated in the Corporation\'s notice
that such holder elects to have the Corporation treat the Optional
Liquidation Event as a Liquidation Event with respect to its shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock and the number of shares such holder wishes to have
so treated. If any holder delivers to the Corporation such notice of such
holder\'s election to have the Optional Liquidation Event treated as a
Liquidation Event, such Optional Liquidation Event will be treated as
a Liquidation Event with respect to all shares of Permanent Preferred Stock
with respect to which such election was made, and, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, the Corporation will
make distributions on such shares of Permanent Preferred Stock in accordance
with paragraphs 4(a) and, if applicable, 4(b) above.  5. Conversion
Rights.   (a) If the Required Stockholder Approval is obtained on or prior
to the date that is 270 days after the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date,
then each share of Permanent Preferred Stock shall automatically be
converted, without any further action on the part of the Corporation or any
holder of Permanent Preferred Stock, into a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to (x) the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to all dividends
accrued and unpaid thereon from the beginning of the Dividend Period during
which the Conversion Date occurs to the Conversion Date divided by (y) the
Conversion Price. Immediately following such conversion, the rights of the
holders of converted Permanent Preferred Stock shall cease and the persons
entitled to receive the Common Stock upon the conversion of Permanent
Preferred Stock shall be treated for all purposes as having become the owners
of such Common Stock.   (b) If the Required Stockholder Approval is not
obtained on or prior to the date that is 270 days after the Initial Bridge
Preferred Issue Date, the Permanent Preferred Stock will not automatically
convert into shares of Common Stock upon receipt of the Required Stockholder
Approval and any of the following may occur at any time after the date on
which the Required Stockholder Approval has been obtained and prior to the
close of business on the Business Day preceding the Redemption Date:   
12     (i) each share of Permanent Preferred Stock shall be convertible
at  the option of the holder into a number of shares of Common Stock equal
to  (x) the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to all dividends 
accrued and unpaid thereon from the beginning of the Dividend Period during 
which the Conversion Date occurs to the Conversion Date divided by (y) the 
Conversion Price; or   (ii) at the election of the holders of at least a
majority of the  shares of Permanent Preferred Stock then outstanding, each
share of  Permanent Preferred Stock shall be converted into a number of
shares of  Common Stock equal to (x) the Liquidation Preference plus an
amount equal  to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon from the beginning
of the  Dividend Period during which the Conversion Date occurs to the
Conversion  Date divided by (y) the Conversion Price;  provided, however,
that if the Corporation shall default in payment of the Redemption Price, the
rights of conversion set forth in paragraphs 5(b)(i) and (ii) above shall be
reinstated.   (c) If the Permanent Preferred Stock is converted pursuant to
paragraph 5(a), 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(ii), such conversion shall be effective for
all purposes on the date that the Required Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, the date that a holder elects to convert his or her shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock or the date that the
holders of at least a majority of the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock
elect such conversion, respectively (the "Conversion Date"). Following the
Conversion Date, the holder of certificates formerly evidencing shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock shall (i) surrender the certificate or certificates
evidencing the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock to be converted, duly
endorsed at the principal office of the Corporation or transfer agent for the
Permanent Preferred Stock, if any, (ii) notify the Corporation in writing of
the name or names in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates
for shares of Common Stock to be issued and (iii) pay any transfer or similar
tax if required (provided, however, that no such payment shall be required if
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion is to be issued in the name of the
converting holder of Permanent Preferred Stock). In the case of lost or
destroyed certificates formerly evidencing ownership of shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock to be surrendered, the holder shall submit such proof of loss
or destruction. The date on which the holder satisfies the foregoing
requirements is referred to as the "Delivery Date." As soon as practicable
after the Delivery Date, the Corporation shall deliver or shall deliver
through its transfer agent a certificate for the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion and a check for any fractional
share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, regardless of whether a holder shall
have surrendered such holder\'s certificates evidencing shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock and/or received in respect thereof certificates
evidencing shares of Common Stock, such holder shall from and after the
Conversion Date be treated for all purposes as a record holder of the number
of shares of Common Stock, into which such holder\'s shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock shall have been converted until such time as record ownership
is transferred and the certificate held by such holder formerly representing
ownership of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock shall, until surrendered in
exchange for new certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock as
contemplated above, be deemed for all purposes to evidence the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares of Permanent Preferred
Stock formerly held by such holder. All shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Permanent Preferred Stock shall be fully paid and
nonassessable. Holders of Common Stock issued upon conversion pursuant to
paragraph 5(a) or 5(b) and this paragraph 5(c) shall not be entitled to
receive any dividend payable    13    to holders of Common Stock as of
any record time before the close of business on the applicable Conversion
Date.   (d) The Corporation shall not issue a fractional share of Common
Stock upon conversion of Permanent Preferred Stock. Instead, the Corporation
shall deliver a check for an amount equal to the value of the fractional
share. The value of a fraction of a share is determined by multiplying the
Current Market Price of the Common Stock as of the Conversion Date by the
fraction, rounded to the nearest cent. If a holder of Permanent Preferred
Stock converts more than one share at a time the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be based on the total number of
all shares of Permanent Preferred Stock converted.   (e) A holder delivering
Permanent Preferred Stock for conversion will not be required to pay any
taxes or duties in respect of the issue or delivery of Common Stock on
conversion but will be required to pay any tax or duty that may be payable in
respect of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of the shares of
Common Stock. Certificates representing shares of Common Stock will not be
issued or delivered unless all taxes and duties, if any, payable by
the holder have been paid.   (f) The Corporation has reserved and shall
continue to reserve out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its
Common Stock held in treasury enough shares of Common Stock to permit the
conversion of the Permanent Preferred Stock in full. All shares of Common
Stock issued upon conversion of Permanent Preferred Stock shall be fully paid
and nonassessable. The Corporation shall comply with all securities laws
regulating the offer and delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion
of Permanent Preferred Stock and will list the shares of Common Stock on each
national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed.   (g) If
the Corporation after the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date:   (i) pays a
dividend or makes a distribution on its Common Stock in  shares of its Common
Stock;   (ii) subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater  number of shares;   (iii) combines its outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a smaller  number of shares; or   (iv) issues by
reclassification of its Common Stock any shares of its  capital
stock;  then the Conversion Price (as in effect immediately prior to such
action) shall proportionately be adjusted so that the holder of Permanent
Preferred Stock thereafter converted into Common Stock may receive for the
same aggregate Conversion Price the aggregate number and kind of shares of
capital stock of the Corporation that such holder would have owned
immediately following such action if such holder had converted Permanent
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such action (assuming the occurrence of
the Required Stockholder Approval). The adjustment shall become effective
immediately after the record date, in the case of a dividend or distribution,
and    14    immediately after the effective date of a subdivision,
combination or reclassification. Such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever any event listed above shall occur. If, after an adjustment referred
to in clauses (i) through (iv) above, a holder of Permanent Preferred Stock
upon conversion of it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital
stock of the Corporation, the Corporation shall determine (subject to
paragraph 5(n)) the allocation of the Conversion Price between the classes of
capital stock. After such allocation, the conversion rights and the
Conversion Price with respect to each class of capital stock shall thereafter
be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to Common
Stock in this paragraph 5(f).   (h) If at any time or from time to time
after the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date, the Corporation issues or
sells, or is deemed by the provisions of this paragraph 5(g) to have issued
or sold, Additional Shares of Common Stock, otherwise than in connection with
a transaction described in paragraph 5(f), for an Effective Price (as
hereinafter defined) that is less than the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such issue or sale, then, and in each such case, the
Conversion Price shall be reduced, as of the close of business on the date of
such issue or sale, to a price determined by multiplying the Conversion Price
by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below) immediately prior to
such issue or sale, plus (B) the number of shares of Common Stock which the
Aggregate Consideration Received (as defined in below) by the Company for the
total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock so issued would purchase at
such applicable Conversion Price, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock deemed outstanding (as defined below)
immediately prior to such issue or sale plus the total number of Additional
Shares of Common Stock so issued. For the purposes of the preceding sentence,
the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be outstanding as of a given
date shall be the sum of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock actually
outstanding, (B) the number of shares of Common Stock into which the then-
outstanding shares of Bridge Preferred and Permanent Preferred could be
converted if fully converted on the day immediately preceding the given date,
and (C) the number of shares of Common Stock which could be obtained through
the exercise or conversion of all other rights, options and convertible
securities outstanding on the day immediately preceding the given date. No
adjustment shall be made to the Conversion Price in an amount less than one
cent per share. Any adjustment otherwise required by this paragraph 5(h) that
is not required to be made due to the preceding sentence shall be included in
any subsequent adjustment to the Conversion Price.   For the purpose of
making any adjustment required under this paragraph 5(h):   "Additional
Shares of Common Stock" shall mean all shares of Common Stock issued by the
Corporation, other than (i) shares of Common Stock and shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of Bridge Preferred Stock,
(ii) shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
Convertible Securities outstanding as of the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue
Date or upon exercise of Rights or Options outstanding on the Initial Bridge
Preferred Issue Date, and (iii) shares of Common Stock and/or Rights or
Options (and the Common Stock issued pursuant to such Rights or Options)
issued after the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date to employees, officers
or directors of, or consultants or advisors to, the Company or any Subsidiary
pursuant to any stock purchase or stock option plans or other compensatory
arrangements that are approved by the Board of Directors; (iv) shares of
Common Stock and/or Rights or Options (and the Common Stock issued pursuant
to such Rights or    15    Options) issued for consideration other than
cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation, acquisition or similar business
combination approved by the Board of Directors; and (v) shares of Common
Stock issued pursuant to any equipment leasing arrangement, or debt financing
from a bank or similar financial institution approved by the Board of
Directors.   The "Aggregate Consideration Received" by the Corporation for
any issue or sale (or deemed issue or sale) of securities shall (A) to the
extent it consists of cash, be computed at the amount of cash received by the
Corporation in connection with such issuance or sale; (B) to the extent it
consists of property other than cash, be computed at the fair value of that
property; (C) if Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities or
Rights or Options to purchase either Additional Shares of Common Stock or
Convertible Securities are issued or sold together with other stock or
securities or other assets of the Corporation for a consideration which
covers both, be computed as the portion of the consideration so received that
may be reasonably determined in good faith by the Board of Directors to be
allocable to such Additional Shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities
or Rights or Options, as applicable; and (D) if Additional Shares of Common
Stock are issued or sold in a public offering or private placement, the
consideration shall be deemed to be the amount of cash paid therefor after
deducting therefrom any discounts, commissions or placement fees payable by
the Corporation to any underwriter or placement agent in connection with the
issuance and sale thereof.   "Convertible Securities" shall mean stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common
Stock;   The "Effective Price" of Additional Shares of Common Stock shall
mean the quotient determined by dividing (i) the Aggregate Consideration
Received, or deemed to have been received, by the Corporation under this
paragraph 5(h), for the issue of such Additional Shares of Common Stock by
(ii) the total number of Additional Shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or
deemed to have been issued or sold, by the Corporation under this paragraph
5(h); and   "Rights or Options" shall mean warrants, options or other rights
to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock or Convertible Securities.  
For the purpose of making any adjustment to the Conversion Price
required under this paragraph 5(h), if after the Initial Bridge Preferred
Issue Date the Corporation issues or sells any Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities and if the Effective Price of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of such Rights or Options and/or the conversion
or exchange of Convertible Securities (computed without reference to any
additional or similar protective or antidilution clauses) is less than the
Conversion Price, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have issued, at the
time of the issuance of such Rights, Options or Convertible Securities, that
number of Additional Shares of Common Stock that is equal to the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of such
Rights, Options or Convertible Securities upon their issuance and to have
received, as the Aggregate Consideration Received for the issuance of such
shares, an amount equal to the total amount of the consideration, if any,
received by the Corporation for the issuance of such Rights or Options or
Convertible Securities, plus, in the case of such Rights or Options, the
minimum amounts of consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the
exercise in full of such Rights or Options, plus, in the case of Convertible
Securities, the minimum amounts of consideration, if    16    any,
payable to the Corporation (other than by cancellation of liabilities
or obligations evidenced by such Convertible Securities) upon the conversion
or exchange thereof; provided that (i) if the minimum amounts of such
consideration cannot be ascertained, but are a function of antidilution or
similar protective clauses, then the Corporation shall be deemed to have
received the minimum amounts of consideration without reference to such
clauses, and (ii) if the minimum amount of consideration payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of Rights or Options or the conversion or
exchange of Convertible Securities is reduced over time or upon the
occurrence or non-occurrence of specified events other than by reason of
antidilution or similar protective adjustments, then the Effective Price
shall be recalculated using the figure to which such minimum amount of
consideration is reduced. On any change ("Pricing Change") in the number of
shares of Common Stock deliverable upon exercise of any Rights or Options or
the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities or any change in the
consideration to be received by the Corporation upon such exercise,
conversion or exchange, including, but not limited to, a change resulting
from the antidilution provisions thereof, the Conversion Price as then in
effect shall forthwith be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would
have been obtained had the unexercised portion of such Rights or Options
or Convertible Securities been originally issued with the exercise or
conversion price in effect following such Pricing Change. On the expiration
or cancellation of any Rights or Options that are unexercised, or the
termination of the right to convert or exchange any such Convertible
Securities, if the Conversion Price shall have been adjusted upon the
issuance thereof, the Conversion Price shall forthwith be readjusted to such
Conversion Price as would have been obtained had an adjustment been made upon
the issuance of such Rights or Options or such Convertible Securities on the
basis of the issuance of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually
issued upon the exercise of such Rights or Options or upon the conversion or
exchange of such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment of the
Conversion Price shall be made as a result of the actual issuance of shares
of Common Stock on the exercise of any such Rights or Options or the
conversion or exchange of any such Convertible Securities.   (i) In case of
any consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation
with or into another Person or any merger of another Person with or into the
Corporation (other than a transaction to which paragraph 5(g) applies), or in
case of any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation, subject to paragraph 4(e) above, each share of Permanent
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall, without the consent of the holder of
any Permanent Preferred Stock, become convertible only into the kind and
amount of securities, cash and other property receivable upon
such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer by a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock (and other securities, if applicable) into which such
Permanent Preferred Stock was convertible immediately prior thereto (assuming
such holder of Common Stock (and other securities, if applicable) failed to
exercise any rights of election and that the Required Stockholder Approval
was obtained). Concurrently with the consummation of such transaction, the
corporation formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger if other
than the Corporation, or the person to which such sale or conveyance shall
have been made, shall enter into a supplemental agreement so providing and
further providing for adjustments which shall be as equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this paragraph.   (j) For
purposes of any computation respecting consideration received pursuant to a
transaction described or contemplated by this paragraph 5, whenever this
Certificate of Designations calls for the determination of "fair market
value," such fair market value shall be    17    determined in good
faith by the Board of Directors as evidenced by a written resolution thereof,
subject to the provisions of paragraph 5(o) below.   (k) The Corporation
shall take no action that would cause any adjustment under this paragraph 5
that would reduce the Conversion Price below the par value of the Common
Stock.   (l) Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted, the Corporation
shall promptly mail to holders of Permanent Preferred Stock, first class,
postage prepaid, a notice of the adjustment and a certificate from the
Corporation\'s independent public accountants briefly stating the facts
requiring the adjustment and the manner of computing it. Subject to paragraph
5(n) below, the certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the adjustment
is correct.   (m) The Corporation from time to time may, by a vote of two-
thirds of the Board of Directors reduce the Conversion Price by any amount
for any period of time if the period is at least twenty (20) Business Days
and if the reduction is irrevocable during the period, but in no event may
the Conversion Price be less than the par value of a share of Common Stock.
Whenever the Conversion Price is so reduced, the Corporation shall mail to
holders of Permanent Preferred Stock a notice of the reduction. The
Corporation shall mail the notice first class, postage prepaid, at least 20
days before the date the reduction in the Conversion Price is to take effect.
The notice shall state the reduced Conversion Price and the period it will be
in effect. A reduction of the Conversion Price pursuant to this paragraph
5(m) does not change or adjust the Conversion Price otherwise in effect for
purposes of paragraph 5(g) above.   (n) If:   (i) the Corporation takes
any action that would require an adjustment  in the Conversion Price pursuant
to clause (iv) of paragraph 5(g) above;   (ii) the Corporation consolidates
or merges with, or transfers all or  substantially all of its assets to,
another corporation, and stockholders  of the Corporation must approve the
transaction; or   (iii) there is a dissolution or liquidation of the
Corporation;  a holder of Permanent Preferred Stock may want to convert such
stock into shares of Common Stock prior to the record date for or the
effective date of such transaction. Therefore, the Corporation shall mail to
such holders a notice, first class, postage prepaid, stating the proposed
record or effective date, as the case may be. The Corporation shall mail such
notice at least ten (10) business days before such date.   (o) Except as
otherwise provided in this paragraph, any determination that the Corporation
or its Board of Directors must make pursuant to this paragraph 5 shall be
conclusive. Whenever the Corporation or its Board of Directors shall
be required to make a determination under this paragraph 5, such
determination shall be made in good faith and may be challenged in good faith
by the holders of a majority of the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock then
outstanding (with any shares held by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates
not being considered to be outstanding for purposes of this Certificate of
Designations), and any dispute shall    18    be resolved, at the non-
prevailing party\'s expense, by an investment banking firm of recognized
national standing selected by the Corporation and reasonably acceptable to
such holders of a majority of the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock.  
(p) All shares of Permanent Preferred Stock converted pursuant to
this paragraph 5 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of
authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to
series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred
stock other than Permanent Preferred Stock.   (q) The Corporation shall not
avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to
be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but shall at all times
in good faith assist in carrying out all such action as may be reasonably
necessary or appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the
holders of the Permanent Preferred Stock against impairment.  6. Redemption
by the Corporation.   (a) The Corporation shall (subject to the legal
availability of funds therefore) be required to redeem, at the option of the
holders of the Permanent Preferred Stock (exercised as provided in
subparagraph 6(b)) all outstanding shares of the Permanent Preferred Stock
requested to be redeemed by such holders (as provided in subparagraph 6(b)),
at the Redemption Price, on or at any time following the Initial Redemption
Date; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to redeem
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 6(a) prior to
August 31, 2010 to the extent such redemption is not permitted by the terms
of the Senior Debt.   (b) Notice shall be sent by or on behalf of the
Corporation not more than sixty (60) days nor less than thirty (30) days
prior to the Initial Redemption Date, by first class mail, postage prepaid,
to all holders of record of the Permanent Preferred Stock at their respective
last addresses as they shall appear on the books of the Corporation notifying
each such holder that all shares of Permanent Preferred Stock are eligible
for redemption by the Corporation; provided, however, that no failure to give
such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall (i) relieve
the Corporation from its obligation to redeem the Permanent Preferred Stock
pursuant to this paragraph 6 or (ii) affect the validity of the proceedings
for the redemption of any shares of Permanent Preferred Stock; provided that
the Corporation shall be obligated in accordance with this paragraph 6 to
redeem shares of Permanent Preferred Stock held by any holder to whom the
Corporation has failed to give notice or as to whom notice was defective. In
addition to any information required by law or by the applicable rules of any
exchange upon which Permanent Preferred Stock may be listed or admitted to
trading, such notice shall state: (i) the Initial Redemption Date; (ii) the
Redemption Price; (iii) the place or places in the United States where
certificates for such shares are to be surrendered for payment of the
Redemption Price; (iv) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease
to accrue on the Redemption Date; (v) the Conversion Price; (vi) that
Permanent Preferred Stock called for redemption may be converted at any time
before the close of business on the Redemption Date; and (vii) that holders
of Permanent Preferred Stock must satisfy the requirements of paragraph 5
above if such holders desire to convert such shares. In order for the
Permanent Preferred Stock to be redeemed at the option of the holder, the
holder must (i) notify the Corporation at such office that such holder elects
to have the    19    Corporation redeem it shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock and the number of shares such holder wishes to have redeemed
(any such notice being referred to as a "Redemption Demand") and (ii)
surrender the certificate or certificates evidencing the shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock to be redeemed, duly endorsed at the office of the
Corporation or transfer agent for the Permanent Preferred Stock (or such
other location identified in the Corporation\'s notice sent pursuant to this
paragraph 6(b)). In the case of lost or destroyed certificates evidencing
ownership of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock to be surrendered for
redemption, the holder shall submit such proof of loss or destruction. In the
event that a holder fails to notify the Corporation of the number of
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock which such holder wishes to redeem, such
holder shall be deemed to have elected to redeem all shares represented by
the certificate or certificates surrendered for redemption. Upon satisfaction
of the foregoing requirements the Corporation shall on the later of (i) the
Initial Redemption Date and (ii) the date on which such requirements are
satisfied (the "Redemption Date"), redeem for the Redemption Price the shares
of Permanent Preferred Stock for which such requirements have been satisfied.
As soon as practicable after the Redemption Date and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the holder of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock,
the Redemption Price for such shares of Permanent Preferred Stock for which
such holder is seeking redemption.   (c) On or prior to each Redemption
Date, the Corporation shall deposit the Redemption Price for all shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock required to be redeemed pursuant to this paragraph
6 with a bank or trust corporation having aggregate capital and surplus in
excess of $100,000,000 as a trust fund for the benefit of the respective
holders of the Permanent Preferred Stock, with irrevocable instructions and
authority to the bank or trust corporation to pay the Redemption Price for
such shares to their respective holders on or after the Redemption Date, upon
receipt of notification from the Corporation that such holder has surrendered
his, her or its share certificate to the Corporation pursuant to paragraph
6(b) above.   (d) If a Redemption Demand has been received by the
Corporation in accordance with paragraph 6(b) above with respect to any
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock and provided that, on or before the
Redemption Date with respect to any shares of Permanent Preferred Stock, all
funds necessary for redemption of such shares shall have been set aside by
the Corporation, separate and apart from its other funds in trust for the pro
rata benefit of the holders of such shares of Permanent Preferred Stock, so
as to be, and to continue to be available therefor, then, from and after the
Redemption Date, dividends on such shares of Permanent Preferred Stock shall
cease to accrue, and said shares shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding
and shall not have the status of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock, and all
rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of the Corporation (except the
right to receive from the Corporation the Redemption Price) shall cease. Upon
surrender, in accordance with said notice, of the certificates for any shares
so redeemed (properly endorsed or assigned for transfer, if the Corporation
shall so require and the notice shall so state), such shares shall be
redeemed by the Corporation at the Redemption Price.   (e) Any funds
deposited with a bank or trust Corporation for the purpose of redeeming
Permanent Preferred Stock shall be irrevocable except that:   (i) the
Corporation shall be entitled to receive from such bank or  trust Corporation
the interest or other earnings, if any, earned on any  money so deposited
in    20    trust, and the holders of any shares redeemed shall have no
claim to such interest or other earnings; and   (ii) any balance of monies
so deposited by the Corporation and  unclaimed by the holders of the
Permanent Preferred Stock entitled thereto  at the expiration of two (2)
years from the applicable Redemption Date  shall be repaid, together with any
interest or other earnings earned  thereon, to the Corporation, and after any
such repayment, the holders of  the shares entitled to the funds so repaid to
the Corporation shall look  only to the Corporation for payment without
interest or other earnings.   (f) No Permanent Preferred Stock may be
redeemed except with funds legally available for the payment of the
Redemption Price. If, upon any Redemption Date, the assets of the Corporation
legally available to redeem the Permanent Preferred Stock shall be
insufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Permanent Preferred Stock,
(i) the Corporation shall redeem that number of shares of Permanent Preferred
Stock required to redeem on such Redemption Date that may be redeemed with
the assets of the Corporation legally available to redeem the Permanent
Preferred Stock (pro rata among the holders of Permanent Preferred Stock
requesting redemption on such Redemption Date based on the relative number of
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock held by such holders) and (ii) any
unredeemed shares shall be carried forward and shall be redeemed at such time
as funds are legally available to so redeem such shares. All shares
of Permanent Preferred Stock which are subject to redemption hereunder but
which have not been redeemed due to insufficient legally available funds and
assets shall continue to be outstanding and entitled to all dividends,
liquidation, conversion and other rights, preferences and privileges of the
Permanent Preferred Stock until such shares are converted or redeemed.  
(g) All shares of Permanent Preferred Stock redeemed pursuant to
this paragraph 6 shall be retired and shall be restored to the status of
authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock, without designation as to
series and may thereafter be reissued as shares of any series of preferred
stock other than shares of Permanent Preferred Stock.   (h) Except as
specifically provided in this paragraph 6, the Permanent Preferred Stock
shall not be redeemable.  7. Voting Rights.   In addition to any voting
rights provided by law, the holders of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock
shall have the following voting rights:   (a) On any matter on which the
holders of Permanent Preferred Stock are entitled by law or under the
Certificate of Incorporation to vote separately as a class, each such holder
shall be entitled to one vote for each share held, and such matter shall be
determined by a majority of the votes cast unless the Delaware General
Corporation Law or this Certificate of Designations requires approval by a
higher percentage. Such voting right of the holders of the Permanent
Preferred Stock may be exercised at any annual meeting of stockholders, any
special meeting of stockholders (including any special meeting of holders of
such series of Permanent Preferred Stock), or by written consent of the
minimum number of shares required to take such action pursuant to Section 228
of the Delaware General Corporation Law.    21     (b) During such time
that the aggregate number of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock outstanding
is equal to at least twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Bridge
Preferred Stock outstanding on the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date (after
giving effect to the issuance of all shares of Bridge Preferred Stock issued
on the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue Date), the Corporation shall not,
without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority
of the issued and outstanding shares of Permanent Preferred Stock:   (i)
amend, modify, alter, repeal or waive the application of  (including by way
of merger, consolidation, combination or otherwise) any  provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Corporation  or any of its
Subsidiaries in any manner that adversely effects the powers,  rights,
preferences or privileges of the holders of the Permanent Preferred  Stock,
or enter into any agreement or take any other corporate action (or  permit
any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any agreement or take any  corporate
action) which would in any way amend, modify alter, repeal or  waive the
powers, rights, preferences or privileges of the Permanent  Preferred
Stock;   (ii) amend (including by way of merger, consolidation, combination
or  otherwise) in any respect this Certificate of Designations or
subdivide,  combine or reclassify the Permanent Preferred Stock, other than
changes in  the name of the issuing corporation as contemplated by paragraph
16;   (iii) redeem, acquire, purchase, defease or otherwise retire for
value  or make any other payment or distribution in respect of any shares
of  capital stock of the Corporation or any Subsidiaries of the
Corporation,  other than (a) any such redemption, acquisition, purchase,
retirement or  other payment or distribution in respect of the Permanent
Preferred Stock,  (b) any redemption, acquisition, purchase, retirement or
other payment or  distribution by any Subsidiary of the Corporation in
respect of shares of  capital stock of such Subsidiary held by the
Corporation or another  wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Corporation, (c) to
the extent permitted  under the terms of the then outstanding Indebtedness of
the Corporation and  its Subsidiaries, the repurchase from terminated or
retired employees of  shares of Common Stock or options to purchase Common
Stock, in each case,  issued under any stock purchase or stock option plans
or other compensatory  arrangements that are approved by the Board of
Directors, and (d) the  cashless exercise of Options and the surrender by
holders of restricted  shares of capital stock of the Corporation in payment
of any tax  liabilities by such holders pursuant to any stock purchase or
stock option  plans or other compensatory arrangements that are approved by
the Board of  Directors;   (iv) create, authorize or issue (including on
conversion or exchange  of any convertible or exchangeable securities or by
reclassification)  shares of any class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation other  than: (i) the issuance of shares of Common Stock or
Permanent Preferred  Stock upon conversion of the Bridge Preferred Stock;
(ii) the issuance of  shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Permanent
Preferred Stock; (iii)  the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon exercise
of Rights and Options  or conversion of    22     Convertible
Securities outstanding on the Initial Bridge Preferred Issue  Date; (iv) the
issuance of a number of Options (and the issuance of Common  Stock upon
exercise thereof) under the Corporation\'s 1999 Equity Incentive  Plan
calculated as the lesser of 1,500,000 or 5% of the Corporation\'s 
outstanding Common Stock (adjusted appropriately for any stock split with 
respect to the Common Stock or any subdivision or combination of the Common 
Stock) in each year commencing July 1, 2000 through July 1, 2009; provided 
however, that the per share exercise price of any such Options shall not be 
less than the Conversion Price; and (v) the issuance of a number of shares 
under the Corporation\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan calculated as the 
lesser of 800,000 or 3% of the Corporation\'s outstanding Common Stock 
(adjusted appropriately for any stock split with respect to the Common  Stock
or any subdivision or combination of the Common Stock) in each year 
commencing July 1, 2000 through July 1, 2009.   (v) permit any Subsidiary of
the Corporation to create, authorize or  issue (including on conversion or
exchange of any convertible or  exchangeable securities or by
reclassification) any class or series of  capital stock of such
Subsidiary;   (vi) enter into (or permit any Subsidiary of the Corporation
to enter  into) any transaction involving (a) any payment to, or any sale,
lease,  transfer or other disposition of any properties or assets to, any
Affiliate  of the Corporation, (b) any purchase, acquisition or lease of
property or  assets from any Affiliate of the Corporation, or (c) any loan,
guarantee or  advance to or from or for the benefit of, or any contract,
agreement or  lease with, any Affiliate of the Corporation, other than (I)
any employment  agreement entered into by the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries in the  Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in the ordinary
course of business  with any employee of the Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries; (II) any  transaction between or among the Corporation and/or
its Subsidiaries; (III)  payment of directors\' fees to Persons who are not
otherwise Affiliates of  the Corporation other than by reason of their

benefits provided to, or  any agreement to pay such compensation or benefits
with, officers and  employees of the Corporation; and (V) transactions with
holders of the  Permanent Preferred Stock;   (viii) effect any voluntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of  the Corporation;   (ix) except
as permitted by the express terms of the Senior Debt  (without regard to any
waiver of rights thereunder), purchase, acquire or  lease (or permit any
Subsidiary of the Corporation to purchase, acquire or  lease), in one
transaction or series of related transactions, assets,  properties, capital
stock or other securities of any Person (other than any  (i) inventory
purchases in the ordinary course of business pursuant to any  contract in
effect or executed on or before the Initial Bridge Preferred  Issue Date and
(ii) inventory purchases in the ordinary course of business  pursuant to any
contract to be executed by the    23     Corporation after the Initial
Bridge Preferred Issue Date, but not  including initial payments or
consideration for inventory, license fees,  distribution rights or other
similar payments;   (x) take any action (or permit any Subsidiary of the
Corporation to  take any action) that would cause a dividend or other
distribution to be  received by the holders of Bridge Preferred Stock or
Permanent Preferred  Stock for federal income tax purposes unless such
dividend or other  distributions is actually received by such holders in
cash;   (xi) except as permitted by the express terms of the Senior Debt 
(without regard to any waiver of rights thereunder), incur or guarantee or 
permit any Subsidiary of the Corporation to incur or guarantee any 
Indebtedness; or   (xii) declare or pay any dividends or make any other
distributions in  respect of Common Stock or any other class of Junior Stock
(other than  dividends on Common Stock payable solely in additional shares of
Common  Stock).   (c) Upon the failure by the Corporation to pay six
quarterly dividends provided for in paragraph 3, the holders of Permanent
Preferred Stock shall have the exclusive right to elect two Directors at the
Corporation\'s next annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent
annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that if such voting rights
shall become vested more than 90 days or less than 20 days before the date
prescribed for the annual meeting of stockholders, thereupon the holders of
the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock shall be entitled to exercise their
voting rights at a special meeting of the holders of shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock as set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph
7(c). At elections for such Directors, each holder of Permanent Preferred
Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held. Upon the vesting of
such right of the holders of Permanent Preferred Stock, the maximum
authorized number of members of the Board of Directors shall automatically be
increased by two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of
the holders of outstanding Permanent Preferred Stock as set forth herein. The
right of holders of Permanent Preferred Stock to elect members of the Board
of Directors as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all accrued and
unpaid dividends on the Permanent Preferred Stock have been paid in full, at
which time such right shall terminate, except as herein or by law expressly
provided, subject to revesting in the event that the Corporation subsequently
fails to pay six quarterly dividends provided for in paragraph 3. Upon the
request of the Corporation after termination of such right, any Directors
elected pursuant to this subparagraph 7(c) shall immediately resign.   (ii)
Whenever such voting right shall have vested, such right may be  exercised
initially either at a special meeting of the holders of shares of  Permanent
Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided, or at any annual  meeting of
stockholders held for the purpose of electing Directors, and  thereafter at
such meetings or by the written consent of such holders  pursuant to Section
228 of the General Corporation Law of the State of  Delaware.   (iii) At
any time when such voting right shall have vested in the  holders of shares
of Permanent Preferred Stock entitled to vote thereon, if  such right shall
not already have    24     been initially exercised, an officer of the
Corporation shall, upon the  written request of holders of record of ten
percent (10%) of the voting  power represented by the shares of such
Permanent Preferred Stock then  outstanding, addressed to the Secretary of
the Corporation, call a special  meeting of holders of shares of such
Permanent Preferred Stock. Such  meeting shall be held at the earliest
practicable date upon the notice  required for annual meetings of
stockholders at the place for holding  annual meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation or, if none, at a place  designated by the Secretary of the
Corporation. If such meeting shall not  be called by the proper officers of
the Corporation within 30 days after  the personal service of such written
request upon the Secretary of the  Corporation, or within 30 days after
mailing the same within the United  States, by registered mail, addressed to
the Secretary of the Corporation  at its principal office (such mailing to be
evidenced by the registry  receipt issued by the postal authorities), then
the holders of record of  ten percent (10%) of the voting power represented
by the shares of  Permanent Preferred Stock then outstanding may designate in
writing any  person to call such meeting at the expense of the Corporation,
and such  meeting may be called by such person so designated upon the notice
required  for annual meetings of stockholders and shall be held at the same
place as  is elsewhere provided in this paragraph. Any holder of shares of
Permanent  Preferred Stock then outstanding that would be entitled to vote at
such  meeting shall have access to the stock books of the Corporation for
the  purpose of causing a meeting of stockholders to be called pursuant to
the  provisions of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this 
paragraph, however, no such special meeting shall be called or held during  a
period within 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next 
annual meeting of stockholders.   (iv) The directors elected pursuant to
this paragraph 7(c) shall serve  until the earlier of (i) the next annual
meeting or until their respective  successors shall be elected and shall
qualify or (ii) until the right of  the holders of Permanent Preferred Stock
to elect such additional Directors  pursuant to this paragraph 7(c) shall
terminate; any Director elected by  the holders of Permanent Preferred Stock
pursuant to this paragraph 7(c)  may be removed by, and shall not be removed
otherwise than by, the vote of  the holders of a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of  the Permanent Preferred Stock who were entitled
to participate in such  election of directors, at a meeting called for such
purpose or by written  consent as permitted by law and the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws  of the Corporation. If the office of any Director
elected by the holders of  Permanent Preferred Stock pursuant to this
paragraph 7(c), becomes vacant  by reason of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal  from office or otherwise, the holders of a
majority of the outstanding  shares of Permanent Preferred Stock may choose a
successor who shall hold  office for the unexpired term in respect of which
such vacancy occurred.  Upon any termination of the right of the holders of
Permanent Preferred  Stock to vote for directors as provided in this
paragraph 7(c), the term of  office of all Directors then in office elected
by the holders of Permanent  Preferred Stock shall terminate immediately.
Whenever the terms of office  of the Directors elected by the holders of
Permanent Preferred Stock shall  so terminate and the special voting powers
vested in the holders of  Permanent Preferred Stock shall have expired, the
number of Directors shall  be such number as may be provided for in the
Bylaws or Certificate of  Incorporation irrespective of any increase made
pursuant to the provisions  of this paragraph 7(c).  8. Repurchase Upon
Change of Control. To the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior Debt,
if a Change of Control occurs, each holder of the Permanent Preferred Stock
shall have the right to require the Corporation to repurchase all or any part
of that holder\'s Permanent    25    Preferred Stock pursuant to the
offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"). In the Change of
Control Offer, the Corporation shall offer a payment in cash for each
outstanding share of Permanent Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (i)
120% of the sum of the Liquidation Preference per share of Permanent
Preferred Stock repurchased plus an amount equal to all dividends accrued and
unpaid thereon from the beginning of the Dividend Period during which the
repurchase occurs to the date of the repurchase and (ii) the
aggregate Current Market Price of all shares of Common Stock issuable
(assuming receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval) upon conversion of

any Change of Control, the Corporation shall mail a notice to each holder of
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock describing the transaction or
transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase
the Permanent Preferred Stock on the date specified in such notice, which
date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed (the "Change of Control Payment Date"), pursuant to the
procedures required by this Certificate of Designations and described in such
notice.   The Corporation shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations
thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in

Corporation shall, to the extent lawful:   (1) accept for payment all
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock or  portions thereof properly tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;   (2) promptly mail to each holder
of Permanent Preferred Stock so  tendered the Change of Control Payment for
each share of Permanent  Preferred Stock so tendered and promptly
authenticate and mail to each such  holder a new certificate representing the

other accrued and unpaid  dividends to any unpurchased portion of the
Permanent Preferred Stock  surrendered, if any.   This paragraph shall be
applicable regardless of whether any other provisions of this Certificate of
Designations are applicable.  9. Repurchase Upon the Occurrence of any
Repurchase Event. Upon the occurrence of any Repurchase Event, to the extent
permitted under the terms of the Senior Debt, and so long as the Required

270 days after the Initial Bridg Preferred Issue Date, the Corporation shall
offer to repurchase all or any part of the Permanent Preferred Stock then
outstanding pursuant to the offer described below (the "Repurchase Event
Offer"). In the Repurchase Event Offer, the Corporation shall use the net
cash proceeds received by the Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries
in connection with such Repurchase Event (the "Repurchase Event Proceeds")
to repurchase the outstanding shares of Permanent Preferred Stock at a
repurchase price equal to the Liquidation Preference, plus an amount equal to
all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon from the beginning of the Dividend
Period during which the    26    Repurchase Event Payment Date occurs
to the Repurchase Event Payment Date (the "Repurchase Event Payment"). Within
30 days following the occurrence of any Repurchase Event, the Corporation
shall mail a notice to each holder of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Repurchase
Event and offering to repurchase the number of shares of Permanent Preferred
Stock equal to (x) the Repurchase Event Proceeds, divided by (y) the sum of
(1) the Liquidation Preference, on the date specified in such notice, which
date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date
such notice is mailed (the "Repurchase Event Payment Date"), plus, (2) an

of the Dividend Period during which the Repurchase Event Payment Date occurs
to the Repurchase Event Payment Date (the "Repurchase Offer Share Number"),
pursuant to the procedures required by this Certificate of Designations and
described in such notice. If the aggregate number of shares of Permanent
Preferred Stock shares tendered into such Repurchase Event Offer exceeds the
Repurchase Offer Share Number, the Corporation will select the shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock to be repurchased on a pro rata basis, based on the
number of shares of Permanent Preferred Stock held by each holder requesting
repurchase of such shares.   The Corporation shall comply with the
requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Permanent Preferred Stock
pursuant to a Repurchase Event Offer.   On the Repurchase Event Payment
Date, the Corporation shall, to the extent lawful:   (1) accept for payment
all shares of Permanent Preferred Stock or  portions thereof properly
tendered pursuant to a Repurchase Event Offer;   (2) promptly mail to each
holder of Permanent Preferred Stock so  tendered the Repurchase Event Payment
for the shares of Permanent Preferred  Stock so tendered and promptly
authenticate and mail to each such holder a  new certificate representing the
shares of Permanent Preferred Stock equal  in Liquidation Preference and
other accrued and unpaid dividends to any  unpurchased portion of the
Permanent Preferred Stock surrendered, if any.  This paragraph shall be

Designations are applicable.  10. Optional Redemption by the Corporation. At
any time on or after August 31, 2010, the Corporation may, upon sixty (60)
days notice to the holders of the Permanent Preferred Stock, redeem all, but
not less than all, of the then-outstanding shares of Permanent Preferred
Stock for cash in an amount per share equal to the Redemption Price.  11.
Modification and Waiver. Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of
this Certificate of Designations may be amended and the rights hereunder
may be waived only with the consent of holders of a majority of the shares of
the Permanent Preferred Stock then outstanding.  12. Headings of
Subdivisions. The headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of any
of the provisions hereof.    27    13. Severability of Provisions. If
any voting powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and
other special rights of the Permanent Preferred Stock and qualifications,
limitations and restrictions thereof set forth in this resolution (as such
resolution may be amended from time to time) is invalid, unlawful or
incapable of being enforced by reason of any rule of law or public policy,

this resolution (as so amended) which can be given effect without the
invalid, unlawful or unenforceable voting powers, preferences and
relative, participating, optional and other special rights of the Permanent
Preferred Stock or qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof
shall, nevertheless, remain in full force and effect, and no voting powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
the Permanent Preferred Stock or qualifications, limitations and restrictions
thereof herein set forth shall be deemed dependent upon any other such voting
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights of Permanent Preferred Stock or qualifications, limitations and
restrictions thereof unless so expressed herein.  14. Record Holders. The
Corporation and the transfer agent for the Permanent Preferred Stock may deem
and treat the record holder of any shares of Permanent Preferred Stock as the
true and lawful owner thereof for all purposes, and neither the Corporation
nor the transfer agent shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.  15. Notice. Except as may otherwise be provided for herein, all
notices referred to herein shall be in writing, and all notices hereunder
shall be deemed to have been given upon the earlier of receipt of such notice
or three Business Days after the mailing of such notice if sent by registered

Corporation or holder, as the case may be, shall have designated by notice
similarly given.  16. Merger or Consolidation of the Corporation. The
Corporation shall not merge or consolidate with any other Person, or enter
into or effect any reorganization, unless the surviving corporation or other
entity resulting from such merger, consolidation or reorganization shall make
appropriate provision in connection with such merger, consolidation or
reorganization such that, subject to paragraph 4(f) above, (i) the shares of
Permanent Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of such merger, consolidation or reorganization remain outstanding
immediately following such merger, consolidation or reorganization or (ii)
the shares of Permanent Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the

Registration Statement made pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b) involves an
underwritten offering and if the underwriter advises the Requesting Holder in
writing that marketing factors require a limitation of the number of shares
to be underwritten (a "CUTBACK"), then the Requesting Holder shall so advise
the Corporation which shall advise all Holders of Registrable
Securities which would otherwise be underwritten pursuant thereto, and the
number of shares of Registrable Securities that may be included in the
underwriting shall be allocated among all participating Holders thereof as
follows: (i) the Blum Holders as a group shall be entitled to the Blum
Cutback Percentage of the Registrable Securities actually sold in the
offering and (ii) the Carlyle Holders as a group shall be entitled to sell
the Carlyle Cutback Percentage of the Registrable Securities actually sold in
the offering; provided, however, that, to the extent that the number of
shares the Blum Holders or the Carlyle Holders, as a group, are entitled to
register pursuant to this sentence exceeds the number that such group of
holders actually seeks to register, then such excess shall be added to the
number of shares that the Carlyle Holders or the Blum Holders, respectively,
shall be entitled to register.   SECTION 3. REGISTRATION BY THE
CORPORATION.   (a) PROCEDURE. If the Corporation at any time proposes
to register any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act (other than
a Registration on Form S-4 with respect to any merger, consolidation
or acquisition, a demand registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or 2(b) or
pursuant to a Special Registration), whether or not for sale for its own
account, and the registration form to be used may be used for the
registration of Registrable Securities, it shall each such time give prompt
written notice to all Holders of Registrable Securities. Upon the written
request of any Holder of Registrable Securities given to the Corporation
within 10 business days after the Corporation has given any such notice, the
Corporation will use its best efforts to effect the registration under the
Securities Act of all Registrable Securities requested by the Holders thereof
to be included registered, provided that:   (i) if, at any time after
giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior
to the effective date of the Registration Statement filed in connection with
such registration, the Corporation shall determine for any reason not to
register such securities, the Corporation may, at its election, give written
notice of such determination to each Holder that was previously notified of
such registration and, thereupon, shall not register any securities
(including Registrable Securities) in connection with such registration (but
shall nevertheless pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith),
without prejudice, however, to the rights of any Holders to request that a
registration be effected under Section 2(a) or 2(b).   (b) CUTBACKS AND
ALLOCATION OF OPPORTUNITY TO REGISTER SECURITIES. If any Registration
Statement made pursuant to this Section 3 involves an underwritten offering
and if the underwriter advises the Corporation in writing that marketing
factors require a Cutback, then the Corporation shall advise the Holders of
Registrable Securities which would otherwise be     7.  underwritten
pursuant hereto, and the number of shares of Registrable Securities that may
be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among all participating
Holders thereof and the Corporation as follows:   (i) The Corporation shall
be entitled to sell 80% of the Registrable Securities actually sold in the
offering; and;   (ii) The Requesting Holders shall be entitled to sell 20%
of the Registrable Securities actually sold in the offering,
allocated according to the Blum Cutback Percentage and the Carlyle Cutback
Percentage; provided, however, that, to the extent that the number of shares
the Blum Holders or the Carlyle Holders, as a group, are entitled to register
pursuant to this sentence exceeds the number that such group of holders
actually seeks to register, then such excess shall be added to the number of
shares that the Carlyle Holders or the Blum Holders, respectively, shall be
entitled to register.   (c) No registration effected under this Section 3
shall relieve the Corporation of its obligation to effect registrations upon
request under Section 2(a) or 2(b). If the offering by the Corporation is not
underwritten, the Corporation shall not be obligated to cause any piggyback
registration under this Section 3 to be underwritten.   SECTION 4. FORM S-3
REGISTRATIONS. In case the Corporation shall receive from any Holder or
Holders of Registrable Securities a written request or requests that the
Corporation effect a registration on Form S-3 or any similar short-form
registration statement and any related qualification or compliance with
respect to all or a part of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder or
Holders, the Corporation will:   (a) promptly give written notice of the
proposed registration, and any related qualification or compliance, to all
other Holders of Registrable Securities; and   (b) as expeditiously as
possible, effect such registration and all such qualifications and
compliances as may be so requested and as would permit or facilitate the sale
and distribution of all or such portion of such Holder\'s or Holders\'
Registrable Securities as are specified in such request, together with all or
such portion of the Registrable Securities of any other Holder or Holders
joining in such request as are specified in a written request given within 10
days after receipt of such written notice from the Corporation; provided,
however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to effect any such
registration, qualification or compliance pursuant to this Section 4:   (i)
if Form S-3 is not available for such offering by the Holders;   (ii) if
the Holders, together with the holders of any other securities of the
Corporation entitled to inclusion in such registration, propose to sell
Registrable Securities and such other securities (if any) at an aggregate
price to the public of less than $5,000,000;   (iii) if within 30 days of
receipt of a written request from any Holder or Holders pursuant to this
Section 4, the Corporation gives notice to such Holder or Holders of the
Corporation\'s bona fide intention to make a public offering within 90 days;
provided, that (i) the Corporation may only give such notice once in any
12-month period and (ii) the Corporation     8.  may not decline to
register shares pursuant to this clause (iii) at any time prior to six (6)
months after the date hereof unless the Corporation is effecting such
registration in order to refinance the Bridge Loans (as defined in the
Commitment Letters (as defined in the Merger Agreement));   (iv) if the
Corporation has, within the 90-day period preceding date of such request,
effected a Corporation-initiated registration (other than a Special
Registration); or   (v) in any particular jurisdiction in which
the Corporation would be required to qualify to do business or to execute a
general consent to service of process in effecting such registration,
qualification or compliance.   (c) Subject to the foregoing, the
Corporation shall file a Form S-3 registration statement covering the
Registrable Securities and other securities so requested to be registered as
expeditiously as possible after receipt of the request or requests of the
Holders.   (d) If requested and if the Corporation is eligible to file
such Registration Statement on Form S-3, the Registration Statement filed
under this Section 4 shall provide for the sale by the Holders thereof of the
Registrable Securities from time to time on a delayed or a continuous basis
under Rule 415 under the Securities Act.   (e) Registrations effected
pursuant to this Section 4 shall not be counted as demands for registration
pursuant to Section 2 or registrations by the Corporation pursuant to Section
3; provided, however, that if such registration includes an underwritten
offering, it shall constitute a separate "DEMAND" registration for purposes
of Section 2(a) and 2(b).   SECTION 5. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. The
Corporation shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection with each
registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement. If and
whenever the Corporation is required to effect or use its best efforts to
effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the Securities
Act as provided in Sections 2, 3 and 4, the Corporation shall:   (a)
Furnish to the Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, copies of all
such documents proposed to be filed (excluding, unless requested, those
documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference and then
only to the Holder who so requested) and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to reflect in each such document, when so filed with the SEC, such
comments as the Holders may reasonably propose. The Corporation shall
not file any such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any
amendments or supplements thereto (excluding any document that would be
incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference) to which the Holder or the
managing underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object in writing (by hand-
delivery, courier guaranteeing overnight delivery or telecopy) within five
Business Days after the receipt of such documents. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Corporation shall not be required to furnish to the Holders or
the managing underwriters, if any, any amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement or Prospectus filed solely to reflect changes to the
Registrable Securities held by any particular Holder or immaterial revisions
to the information contained therein.   (b) Prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments, including post-effective amendments, and supplements to such
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in     9.  connection
therewith and such other documents as may be necessary to keep
such Registration Statement effective, and comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered
by such Registration Statement in accordance with the intended method or
methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such Registration
Statement or Prospectus, as so amended and supplemented, until the earlier
of: (i) 60 days after the effective date of such Registration Statement (720
days in the case of a Shelf Registration pursuant to Section 4(d)) or (ii)
the consummation of the disposition by the Holders of all the Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement and otherwise comply with
the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such Registration Statement.   (c) Notify the Holders
and the managing underwriters, if any, promptly and, if requested by any such
person, confirm such notice in writing:   (i) (1) when a Prospectus or any
Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment is proposed to be filed and
(2) with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment,
when the same has become effective;   (ii) of any written comments from the
SEC with respect to any filing and of any request by the SEC or any other
Federal or state governmental authority for amendments or supplements to such
Registration Statement or related Prospectus or for additional information
related thereto;   (iii) of the issuance by the SEC, any state
securities commission, any other governmental agency or any court of any stop
order, order or injunction suspending or enjoining the use or effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that
purpose;   (iv) of the receipt by the Corporation of any notification with
respect to the suspension of qualification or exemption from qualification of
any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, or the
initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose;   (v) of the
existence of any fact or the happening of any event during the period of
effectiveness that makes any statement of material fact made in such
Registration Statement or related Prospectus untrue in any material respect,
or that requires the making of any changes in such Registration Statement or
Prospectus so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading and that, in the case of the Prospectus, such
Prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; and   (vi) of the determination by the
Corporation that a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement
will be filed with the SEC.     10.   (d) Use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any stop order or order enjoining or
suspending the use or effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the
lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from
qualification) of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.   (e) If requested by the
Requesting Holders, or managing underwriters, if any, to:   (i) promptly
include in a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such
information as the Requesting Holders or managing underwriters, if any, may
reasonably request to be included therein; and   (ii) make all required
filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective amendment as
expeditiously as possible after the Corporation has received notification of
the matters to be included in such Prospectus supplement or post-effective
amendment.   (f) Furnish to each Holder who so requests, and each
managing underwriter, if any, without charge, at least one copy of the
Registration Statement and each amendment thereto (but excluding schedules,
all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference
and all exhibits, unless requested in writing by such Holder or any managing
underwriter and then only to the person who so requested).   (g) Deliver to
each Holder and the underwriters, if any, without charge, as many copies of
the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of Prospectus) and each
amendment or supplement thereto as such persons may request; and, unless the
Corporation shall have given notice to such Holder or underwriter pursuant to
Section 5(c)(v) hereof, the Corporation hereby consents to the use of such
Prospectus, and each amendment or supplement thereto, by each of the selling
Holders of Registrable Securities and the underwriters, if any, in connection
with the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such
Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto.   (h) Prior to any
public offering of Registrable Securities, use all reasonable efforts to
register or qualify, or cooperate with the Holders of Registrable Securities
to be sold or tendered or the underwriters, if any, and their respective
counsel in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption
from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities for
offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions
within the United States as any Holder or underwriter reasonably requests in
writing, keep each such registration or qualification (or
exemption therefrom) effective during the period the Registration Statement
is required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things
legally necessary to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement; provided,
however, that the Corporation shall not be required to qualify generally to
do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, take any
action that would subject it to general service of process in any such
jurisdiction where it is not then so subject or subject the Corporation to
any tax in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.    
11.   (i) In connection with any sale or transfer of Registrable Securities
that will result in such securities no longer being Registrable Securities,
cooperate with the Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, to (1)
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates
representing Registrable Securities to be sold (unless the same shall be in
book-entry form), which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends,
unless required by applicable securities laws, shall bear a CUSIP number
different from the CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities and shall be
in a form eligible for deposit with the Depositary Trust Corporation, and (2)
enable such Registrable Securities to be in such denominations and registered
in such names as the managing underwriters, if any, or Holders may request at
least two Business Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities.   (j)
Use best efforts to cause the offering of the Registrable Securities covered
by the Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
governmental agencies or authorities within the United States as may be
necessary to enable the Holder or managing underwriter, if any, to consummate
the disposition of such Registrable Securities; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall not be required to register the Registrable Securities in
any jurisdiction that would require the Corporation to qualify to do business
in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, subject it to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is not then so subject
or subject the Corporation to any tax in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject.   (k) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by
Section 5(c)(v) hereof, as expeditiously as possible, prepare a supplement or
amendment, including, if appropriate, a post-effective amendment, to the
Registration Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, and
file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered, such
Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.   (l) Prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement relating to the Registrable Securities, to provide a CUSIP number
for the Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant to the Registration
Statement.   (m) Enter into such agreements (including any
underwriting agreements in form, scope and substance as may be reasonably
requested and as are customary in underwritten offerings) and take all such
other appropriate actions in connection therewith (including those reasonably
requested by the managing underwriters, if any, or the Holders of a majority
in interest of the Registrable Securities being sold) in order to expedite or
facilitate the sale of such Registrable Securities, including, without
limitation, reasonable participation of senior management in a "road show."
In connection with any underwritten offering, the Corporation will:   (i)
make such representations and warranties to the Holders of such Registrable
Securities and the underwriters, if any, with respect to the business of the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries (including with respect to businesses or
assets acquired or to be acquired by any of them), and the Registration
Statement, Prospectus and documents, if any,     12.  incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated by reference therein, in each case, in form,
substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters
in underwritten offerings, and confirm the same if and when requested;  
(ii) obtain, as may reasonably be required, opinions of counsel to the
Corporation (which may include in-house counsel) and updates thereof (which
counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance) shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the managing underwriters, if any), addressed to each selling
Holder of Registrable Securities and each of the underwriters, if
any, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in
underwritten offerings (including any such matters as may be reasonably
requested by such underwriters);   (iii) obtain, as may reasonably be
required, customary "cold comfort" letters and updates thereof from the
independent certified public accountants of the Corporation (and, if
necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any
Subsidiary of the Corporation or of any business acquired by the Corporation
for which financial statements and financial data are, or are required to be,
included in the Registration Statement), addressed (where reasonably
possible) to each selling Holder of Registrable Securities and each of the
underwriters, if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering
matters of the type customarily covered in "cold comfort" letters in
connection with underwritten offerings; and   (iv) deliver such documents
and certificates as may be reasonably requested by the Holders of a majority
in interest of the Registrable Securities being sold or the managing
underwriters, if any, to evidence the continued validity of the
representations and warranties made pursuant to clause (i) of this Section
5(m) and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions contained in
the underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the
Corporation;   (n) Make available for inspection by a representative of
the Holders of Registrable Securities being sold, any underwriter
participating in any such disposition of Registrable Securities, if any, and
any attorney, consultant or accountant retained by such selling Holders or
underwriter, at the offices where normally kept, during reasonable business
hours, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries (other than records and
documents that the Corporation and its Subsidiaries agreed contractually not
to disclose and the disclosure of which would violate any such contractual
agreement) as they may reasonably request, and cause the officers, directors,
agents and employees of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to supply all
information (other than information that the Corporation and its Subsidiaries
agreed contractually not to disclose and the disclosure of which would
violate any such contractual agreement) in each case reasonably requested by
any such representative, underwriter, attorney, consultant or accountant in
connection with such Registration Statement and as shall be reasonably
necessary to enable such persons to conduct a reasonable investigation within
the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act; provided, however, that the
foregoing inspection and information gathering shall be coordinated on behalf
of the Holders and the other parties thereto by one counsel designated by and
on behalf of such Holders and other parties.     13.   (o) Use all
reasonable efforts to cause any Registrable Securities included in the
registration, to the extent such Registrable Securities are not already so
listed, to be admitted for trading on the NYSE (or such other exchange or
automated trading system as shall be the primary trading system or exchange
for the Common Stock).   (p) Have the right, if the Board of Directors of
the Corporation, in its good faith judgment, determines that any registration
of shares of Common Stock should not be made or continued because it
would materially interfere with any material financing, acquisition,
corporation reorganization, merger, or other transaction involving the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, or would require premature disclosure
of material non-public information (a "VALID BUSINESS REASON"): (i) to
postpone filing a Registration Statement until such Valid Business Reason no
longer exists, but in no event for more than 180 days, and (ii) to cause any
Registration Statement that has already been filed to be withdrawn and its
effectiveness terminated or to postpone amending or supplementing such
Registration Statement until such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but
in no event for more than 90 days (the "POSTPONEMENT PERIOD"); provided,
however, that in no event shall the Corporation be permitted to postpone or
withdraw a Registration Statement within 12 months after the expiration of
the most recent Postponement Period.   (q) Have the right to require each
Holder of any Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being
effected to furnish to the Corporation such information regarding such Holder
and the distribution of such securities as the Corporation may from time to
time reasonably request in writing and as shall be required by law in
connection therewith. Each such Holder agrees to furnish promptly to the
Corporation all information required to be disclosed in order to make the
information previously furnished to the Corporation by such Holder not
materially misleading. The Corporation agrees not to file or make any
amendment to any Registration Statement with respect to any Registrable
Securities, or any amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus used in
connection therewith, which refers to any seller of any securities
covered thereby by name, or otherwise identifies such seller as the holder of
any securities of the Corporation, without the consent of such seller, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, except that no such consent shall be
required for any disclosure that is required by law. By the acquisition of
Registrable Securities, each Holder shall be deemed to have agreed that upon
receipt of any notice from the Corporation pursuant to Section 5(c) or 5(p),
such Holder will promptly discontinue such Holder\'s disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities until such Holder shall have received: (i) in the case
of Section 5(c), notice from the Corporation that such Registration Statement
has been amended, and copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus, as
contemplated by Section 5(c)(i); or (ii) in the case of Section 5(p), the
time period specified has elapsed or such Holder has received notice from the
Corporation that the Postponement Period has been terminated. If so directed
by the Corporation, each Holder will deliver to the Corporation (at the
Corporation\'s expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, in such
Holder\'s possession of the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities
at the time of receipt of such notice. In the event that the Corporation
shall give any such notice, the period mentioned in Section 5(b) shall be
extended by the number of days during the period from and including the date
of the giving of such notice to and including the date when each seller of
any Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement shall have
received the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by
Section 5(c)(i).     14.   SECTION 6. INDEMNIFICATION.   (a) The
Corporation agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable
Securities, such Holder\'s Affiliates, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, representatives and agents and each Person, if any, who
controls any Holder of Registrable Securities within the meaning of either
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against
any and all loss, liability, claim or damage arising out of any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission to state therein any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, however, that this indemnity agreement shall
not apply to any loss, liability, claim or damage arising out of any untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Corporation by or on behalf of such Holder of Registrable Securities (which
also acknowledges the indemnity provisions herein) or any person, if any, who
controls any such Holder of Registrable Securities expressly for use in the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary
prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto);
provided, further, that this indemnity agreement shall not apply to any loss,
liability, claim or damage if the Holder fails to deliver at or prior to the
written confirmation of sale, the most recent Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented, and such Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, would have
corrected such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission of a material fact (provided that the Corporation has delivered to
such Holder, or otherwise given notice to such Holder of the existence of,
such most recent Prospectus, as supplemented or amended). Any amounts
advanced by the Corporation to an indemnified party pursuant to this
Agreement shall be returned to the Corporation if it shall be finally
determined in a judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction not subject to
appeal, that such indemnified party was not entitled to indemnification.  
(b) In connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement in which
a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating in furnishing information
relating to such Holder of Registrable Securities to the Corporation for use
in such Registration Statement, any preliminary prospectus, the Prospectus or
any amendments or supplements thereto, each such Holder agrees, severally and
not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless any other Holders of Registrable
Securities, the Corporation, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees
representatives and agents and each Person, if any, who controls such other
Holders or the Corporation within the meaning of either such Section, against
any and all loss, liability, claim or damage described in the indemnity
contained in subsection (a) of this Section, as incurred, but only with
respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements
or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto),
or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Corporation by or on behalf of such Holder of
Registrable Securities (which also acknowledges the indemnity provisions
herein) or any person, if any, who controls any such Holder of Registrable
Securities expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment
or supplement thereto).     15.   (C) Each indemnified party shall give
notice as promptly as reasonably practicable to each indemnifying party of
any action commenced against it in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve
such indemnifying party from any liability hereunder to the extent it is not
materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve
it from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this
indemnity agreement. The indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified
party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party
to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may
designate in such proceeding and shall pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel
or (ii) representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It
is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal
expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for (a) the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel),
for each of the Carlyle Holders and Blum Holders, and all Persons, if any,
who control the Holders of Registrable Securities within the meaning of
either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act,
collectively (unless representation of all Holders and such parties by the
same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing
interests between or among them), and (b) the fees and expenses of more than
one separate firm (in addition to any local counsel), for the Corporation and
each Person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of
either such Section, and that all fees and expenses payable under (a) and (b)
above shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of any such
separate firm for the Holders of Registrable Securities, and control persons
of the Holders of Registrable Securities, such firm shall be designated by
the Requesting Holders and shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation. In the case of any such separate firm for the Corporation and
control persons of the Corporation, such firm shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Holders of a majority in interest of the Registrable Securities. So
long as it is participating in the defense of the indemnified party, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), but if settled with such consent or if there be a final
non-appealable judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without
the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution
could be sought under this Section 6 (whether or not the indemnified parties
are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such settlement, compromise
or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party
from all liability arising out of such litigation, investigation, proceeding
or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of
fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified
party. No indemnified party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), settle or compromise or consent     16.  to the entry of any
judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding
by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution could be
sought under this Section 6 (whether or not the indemnified parties are
actual or potential parties thereto).   (d) If the indemnification to which
an indemnified party is entitled under this Section 6 is for any reason
unavailable to or insufficient although applicable in accordance with its
terms to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount of such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses incurred by such indemnified party,
as incurred, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of the indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the
indemnified party on the other hand in connection with the statements or
omissions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.   The
relative fault of the Corporation on the one hand and the Holders of the
Registrable Securities on the other hand shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Corporation or by the Holder of the
Registrable Securities and the parties\' relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission.   The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section
6(d). The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and
expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this
Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include any out-of-pocket legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, or any investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 6, no Holder shall be required to indemnify or contribute any amount
in excess of the amount by which the amount actually received by such Holder
for the Registrable Securities sold by such Holder exceeds the amount of any
damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.   No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.   The
remedies provided in this Section 6 are not exclusive and shall not limit any
rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any indemnified party
at law or in equity.   For purposes of this Section 6(d), each Person, if
any, who controls any Holder of Registrable Securities within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the     17.  Exchange
Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and
each Person, if any, who controls the Corporation within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act shall have
the same rights to contribution as the Corporation. No party shall be liable
for contribution with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or claim
settled, compromised, or with respect to which the party requesting
contribution consented to the entry of a judgment, without such party\'s
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (e) The Corporation may require as a condition to including
the Registrable Securities in the Registration Statement, and to entering
into any underwriting agreement with respect thereto, that the Corporation
shall have received an undertaking from the Holder and such underwriter to
comply with the provisions of this Section 6.   (f) The agreements
contained in this Section 6 shall survive the transfer or sale of the
Registrable Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless
of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation
made by or on behalf of any indemnified party.   SECTION 7. INFORMATION
REQUIREMENTS.   (a) The Corporation agrees that, if at any time the
Corporation is not subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act,
it will cooperate with any Holder of Registrable Securities and use
reasonable efforts to take such further reasonable action as any Holder of
Registrable Securities may request in writing to enable such Holder to sell
Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act within
the limitation of the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and Rule 144A under the
Securities Act (or any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the
SEC) and customarily taken in connection with sales pursuant to such
exemptions, including, without limitation, making available adequate current
public information within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 144 and
delivering the information required by paragraph (d) of Rule 144A.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be deemed to
require the Corporation to register any of its securities under any section
of the Exchange Act.   (B) The Corporation shall file reports required to be
filed by it under the Exchange Act and the rules of the NYSE or any other
securities exchanges or markets on which the Common Stock is listed or
quoted.   SECTION 8. UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATION. If any of the
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement filed in
connection with Sections 2(a) or 2(b) are to be sold in an underwritten
offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager or managers
that will administer the offering will be investment bankers of recognized
national standing selected by the Requesting Holders, subject to the consent
of the Corporation, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No
person may participate in any underwritten registration hereunder unless such
person (a) agrees to sell such person\'s Registrable Securities on the basis
reasonably provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the
Requesting Holders; and (b) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers
of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements, lock-up agreements and
other documents reasonably required under the terms of     18.  such
underwriting arrangements. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, if the underwriter determines in good faith that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the
number of shares that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated
as set forth in Sections 2(f) and 3(b) above.   SECTION 9.
MISCELLANEOUS.   (a) NO INCONSISTENT AGREEMENTS. The Corporation has not
entered into or shall not enter into any agreement that is inconsistent with
the rights granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts
with the provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do

collectively own or control at least 10% of the Voting Securities (assuming
conversion of all outstanding shares of Series D Senior Convertible
Participating Preferred Stock and Series E Senior Cumulative Convertible
Participating Preferred Stock into the Company\'s Common Stock), the Carlyle
Entities, or their permitted assigns, shall have the following contractual
management rights. Such rights shall be in addition to, and nothing in this

Participating Preferred Stock into the Company\'s Common Stock), and until

elected as a member of the Board and to be maintained in such position at all
times (including, without limitation, nominating such person for election as
a member of the Board, causing the Board to recommend to the stockholders of
the Company that such person be elected as a member of the Board and
soliciting proxies and voting such proxies in favor of the election of such
person to the Board).   (ii) In the event that a vacancy is created on the
Board at any time by the death, disability, retirement or resignation of
Joseph E. Lipscomb, the Company and the Carlyle Entities will take such
actions as will result in the election or appointment of a new director
designated by the Carlyle Entities (including, without limitation, nominating
such person for election as a member of the Board, causing the Board to
recommend to the stockholders of the Company that such person be elected as a

otherwise shall have all rights of a director, including: (i) the right to
examine books and records of the Company; (ii) the right to review and
participate in all discussions of the Board including, without limitation,
capital or equity programs; (iii) the right to receive, upon request, any
information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries, and to any
Affiliates thereof; and (iv) the right to meet on a regular basis with the
management personnel of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any Affiliates
thereof; provided that any such designee shall agree to be bound by all
policies relating to confidentiality and material non-public information
which are applicable to the directors and senior executive officers of the
Company.   (d) INFORMATION RIGHTS. The Company shall provide to the
Carlyle Entities, upon written request, such financial and other information
concerning the Company and its subsidiaries as may from time to time be
reasonably requested by the Carlyle Entities in order to comply with
applicable venture capital operating company regulations.   3. STANDSTILL
PROVISIONS. Each Carlyle Entity agrees that, during the term of this
Agreement, without the Company\'s prior written consent, no Carlyle Entity

Senior Convertible Participating Preferred Stock or the Certificate of
Designations for the Series E Senior Cumulative Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock;   (b) seek representation on the Board of the Company
(other than pursuant to the terms of Section 2 hereof or pursuant to the

announcement or proposal whatsoever with respect to a merger or other
business combination, sale or transfer of substantially all of the assets,
recapitalization, dividend, share repurchase, liquidation or other
extraordinary corporate transaction with the Company or any other transaction
which would result in a change of control of the Company (other than the sale
of securities or capital stock of the Company by the Carlyle Entities or
their Affiliates), advise, assist, solicit or encourage any other persons to
make any such statement or proposal;   (d) make, directly or indirectly, any
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined in Rule 14a-1 under

Voting Securities, seek to advise, encourage or influence any person or
entity with respect to the voting of any Voting Securities, initiate or

person to initiate any stockholder proposal (other than any such action in

Carlyle Entities pursuant to Section 2);   (e) deposit any Voting Securities
into a voting trust, unless the trustee of such voting trust agrees to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement;   (f) form, join or in any way
participate in a "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the 1934
Act) with respect to any Voting Securities, other than a group consisting of
the Carlyle Entities and their Affiliates or pursuant to the Voting
Agreement, dated as of July 16, 2002;   (g) make a public request to the
Company (or its directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents) to
take any action in respect of the foregoing matters (other than any such
action in furtherance of the election to the Board of the person designated

Certificate of Designations for the Series E Senior Cumulative Convertible

or arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing; or   (i) request or propose
that the Company or any Representative of the Company amend or waive any
provision set forth in this Section 3.   4. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS. Each
Carlyle Entity agrees that it shall not, directly or indirectly, sell or
transfer beneficial ownership of any Voting Securities (other than to the
Company or any person or group approved by the Company, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if, as a result of such sale or
transfer, the transferee, together with its Affiliates, would beneficially
own 15% percent or more of the Voting Securities; provided, however, that
such sale or transfer shall not require the consent of the Company if: (i)
such transferee agrees to hold all Voting Securities subject to
the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this Agreement; (ii) such sale or
transfer is made pursuant to a bona fide public offering registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 ACT"), or one or more "block
trades" or brokerage transactions pursuant to a registration statement filed
pursuant to the 1933 Act; provided that, to the knowledge of the Carlyle
Entities, no single transferee will, upon     4.   completion of such
block trade or brokerage transaction, beneficially own more than 15% of the
Company\'s Voting Securities ; (iii) such sale or transfer is made pursuant
to Rule 144 under the 1933 Act; or (iv) such sale or transfer is made in

Entities and the Company acknowledges that the other party would not have an
adequate remedy at law for money damages if any of the covenants or
agreements of the other party in this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its terms and therefore agrees that the other party shall be
entitled to specific enforcement of such covenants or agreements and to
injunctive and other equitable relief in addition to any other remedy to
which it may be entitled, at law or in equity.   6. TERMINATION. This
Agreement shall terminate upon the occurrence of any of the following:
