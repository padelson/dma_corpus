Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Nevada law. In determining whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Section&nbsp;5.15, if requested
by such Indemnified Party, such determination shall be made by special, independent counsel selected by Parent and approved by the Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld), and who has not otherwise performed services for Parent or any of its Affiliates within the last three years (other than in connection with such matters). Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against any Indemnified Party(ies) (whether arising before or after the Effective Time): (i)&nbsp;Parent shall have the
right to control the defense of such matter with Parent's regularly engaged independent legal counsel or other counsel selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party(ies), and
Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party(ies) shall cooperate with Parent, at Parent's expense, in the defense of any such matter.
Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld. In the event of any Claim, any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification shall promptly notify Parent thereof (provided, that failure to so notify Parent shall not affect the obligations of Parent except to the extent that Parent shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure) and shall deliver to Parent the undertaking contemplated by the applicable provisions of the NRS, but without any requirement for the posting of a bond. Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Claim is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties, such Indemnified Party(ies) may retain only one law firm (plus one local counsel, if necessary)
to represent them with respect to each such matter unless the use of counsel chosen to represent the Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, or the representation
of all of the Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or reasonably probable differing interests between them, in which case such additional counsel as may be
required (as shall be reasonably determined by the Indemnified Parties and Parent) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties at the cost and expense of Parent and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section&nbsp;5.15 shall be deemed to grant any right to any Indemnified Party
which is not permitted to be granted to an officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent of Parent under applicable Nevada law. </FONT></P>

therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous; (ii)&nbsp;such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and (iii)&nbsp;Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior

SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Termination of the Company Stock Ownership Plan.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company sponsors and maintains the
Company 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>KSOP</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all such action
as may be necessary to terminate the KSOP effective as of a date prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the current trustee of the KSOP shall be replaced by a
qualified institutional trustee selected by the Company and acceptable to Parent. On or prior to the termination date, the new trustee of the KSOP shall cause the KSOP to repay any existing loan(s) of
the KSOP (in accordance with the terms of the loan, the terms of the KSOP, applicable law and in a manner mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent) and the plan administrator shall allocate any
unallocated assets remaining after the loan is repaid in accordance with the terms of the KSOP document and applicable law. Upon the termination date, the accounts of all participants affected by the
termination shall become fully vested and the plan administrator of the KSOP shall direct the trustee of the trust related to the KSOP to distribute the assets remaining in the trust, after payment of
any expenses properly allocable thereto and after receipt of a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the termination of the KSOP will not adversely affect its
qualified status, to participants and beneficiaries in proportion to their respective account balances; provided, however, that distributions will not be delayed until after receipt of a favorable
determination letter with respect to those participants who are otherwise entitled to a distribution under the KSOP by reason of death, disability, retirement, termination of employment or any other
reason permitted under the terms of the KSOP (other than plan termination). Except as otherwise provided in the KSOP, any distributions made after termination of the KSOP may be made, in whole or in
part, in cash or in kind; provided, however, that participants shall have the right, as provided in the KSOP document, to demand payment from their vested KSOP Accounts under the KSOP in the form of
Company Common Stock or if the distribution occurs after the Closing Date, Parent Common Stock (except to the extent of the value of any factional shares, which shall be distributed in cash). The
termination of the KSOP and the exercise of all rights, including but not limited to voting, appurtenant to Company stock in the KSOP shall be effected in a manner mutually acceptable to Company and
Parent. Parent agrees to take all such action as may be necessary to permit rollovers of participant distributions from the KSOP to a defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, provided that such defined contribution plan shall be required to accept a direct rollover in kind only to the extent permitted under the terms of such plan. </FONT></P>
