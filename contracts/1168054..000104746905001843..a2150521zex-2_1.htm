 (a) _ Merger Sub Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation and each certificate evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of the same number of shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _ Parent Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, each share of Parent capital stock then issued and outstanding shall remain issued, outstanding and unchanged. 

  

 (c) _ Company Securities._ 

    

 (i) _ Company Common Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock, with each such share of Company Common Stock being converted into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Conversion Number (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist and shall no longer be outstanding; and the holder of any certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(e) and any unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(c)), without interest, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.5.

effective as of the Effective Time in exchange for a single lump sum cash
payment from the Company or, at Parent\'s option, Parent equal to the product

Company Stock Option (whether or not then exercisable) immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the closing price of

Consents prior to the Closing Date, but notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, the failure to obtain any or all of such Option
Consents shall not result in a failure of a condition to Closing. In the event
that any required Option Consent with respect to a Company Stock Option is
not obtained prior to the Closing Date, then each such outstanding Company
Stock Option, whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and

 (vi) _ Series A Preferred Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof, each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock, with each such share of Series A Preferred Stock being converted into that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing 20 by the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Series A Merger Consideration_"). Each share of Series A Preferred Stock, when so converted, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to exist and shall no longer be outstanding; and the holder of any Series A Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Series A Merger Consideration, which shall be issued in the form of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to the extent possible and otherwise in fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (along with any unpaid dividends and distributions with respect to such whole or fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(c)), without interest, upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.5. 

    

      

    
  

Any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section
2.4(c)(vi) shall entitle the owner thereof to vote in the same manner as the
holder of a whole share of Parent Common Stock but proportionately to the
fractional interest. Parent shall (until the date referenced in the last
sentence of Section 2.5(g)), if it so elects in its sole discretion, offer
holders of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock one or both of the
following options: (1) the right to purchase an additional fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (at the closing sales price of the Parent Common Stock
on Parent\'s primary National Stock Exchange on the day immediately prior to
holder\'s acceptance of such option) sufficient to provide the holder with
a whole share and/or (2) the establishment of an agency arrangement which, on
or prior to the date referenced in the last sentence of Section 2.5(g),
combines fractional shares of participating holders of Parent Common Stock
into whole shares, sells such shares for the account of the participating
holders (to a party other than Parent, a Parent Subsidiary or an Affiliate
of Parent) and then distributes the resulting sales proceeds to the
participating holders in proportion to their contributed fractional share
interests (with related transaction costs to be borne by Parent); provided,
that the provisions of this sentence shall not preclude Parent from offering
other alternatives to holders of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and
that, in no event, shall Parent effectively force holders of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock to receive cash in respect of such fractional

 (viii) _ Shares of Dissenting Stockholders._ Any issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by a Dissenting Stockholder shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the provisions of the NRS, which consideration, in any case, shall be paid by the Company or the Surviving Corporation (as opposed to the Parent); provided, however, shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting Stockholder who shall, after the Effective Time, withdraw his demand for appraisal or lose his right of appraisal as provided in the NRS, shall be deemed to be converted, as of the Effective Time, into the right to receive the Series A Merger Consideration (without interest) in accordance with Section 2.4(c)(vi) and Section 2.5. The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written assertions of dissenters\' rights, withdrawals of such assertions and any other instruments served pursuant to the NRS received by the Company, and (B) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to assertions of dissenters\' rights under the NRS.

 Section 2.5 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

   

 (a) _ Exchange Fund._ Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of (i) the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Agreement, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration, and funds necessary to pay the cash amount for any fractional shares as specified in Section 2.5(e), in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i), and (ii) the holders of shares of 

   

      

   

Series A Preferred Stock and for exchange in accordance with this Agreement,

Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(vi). Such shares of Parent Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto
(as provided in Section 2.5(c)) and such funds, are referred to herein as the
" _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, shall deliver the Parent Common
Stock to be issued or paid pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i) (and the cash amount
for any fractional shares as specified in Section 2.5(e) and any unpaid
dividends and distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) and Section 2.4(c)(vi)
out of the Exchange Fund, and the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose whatsoever. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or
exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Stock held
by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all
dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect thereto for
the account of Persons entitled thereto.

   

 (b) _ Exchange Procedures._ 

    

 (i) _ Common Stock._ 

  

 (1) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company Common Stock, which was converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i), a letter of transmittal to be used to effect the exchange of such Company Certificate for a Parent Certificate (and cash in lieu of fractional shares), along with instructions for using such letter of transmittal to effect such exchange. The letter of transmittal (or the instructions thereto) shall specify that delivery of any Company Certificate shall be effected, and risk of loss and title thereto shall pass, only upon delivery of such Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify. 

  

 (2) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Company Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents (including, in the case of any Person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) and (d) under the Securities Act, a written agreement from such Person as described in Section 5.10, if not theretofore delivered to Parent): (A) the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(i), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.5(e), and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (after giving effect to any required withholding of taxes); and (B) the Company Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares, or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Company Certificates. 

  

 (3) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent Certificate representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive) may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Company Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent 

    

      

    
  

accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer,
including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange Agent may
request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid.

  

 (4) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b)(i), each Company Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a Parent Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.4(c)(i) (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions). 

  

 (ii) _ Series A Preferred Stock._ 

  

 (1) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, to the extent such holder\'s mailing address is known, to each holder of record of a Series A Certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which was converted into the right to receive the Series A Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(vi), a letter of transmittal to be used to effect the exchange of such Series A Certificate for a Parent Certificate, along with instructions for using such letter of transmittal to effect such exchange. The letter of transmittal (or the instructions thereto) shall specify that delivery of any Series A Certificate shall be effected, and risk of loss and title thereto shall pass, only upon delivery of such Series A Certificate to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify. 

  

 (2) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Series A Certificate for cancellation, together with a duly completed and executed letter of transmittal and any other required documents (including, in the case of any Person constituting an "affiliate" of the Company for purposes of Rule 145(c) and (d) under the Securities Act, a written agreement from such Person as described in Section 5.10, if not theretofore delivered to Parent): (A) the holder of such Series A Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a Parent Certificate representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.4(c)(vi) and any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (after giving effect to any required withholding of taxes); and (B) the Series A Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the Series A Merger Consideration or unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of Series A Certificates. 

  

 (3) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Series A Preferred Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a Parent Certificate representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common Stock (along with any unpaid dividends and distributions that such holder has the right to receive) may be issued or paid to a transferee if the Series A Certificate representing such shares of Series A Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer, including such signature guarantees as Parent or the Exchange Agent may request, and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. 

  

 (4) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.5(b)(ii), each Series A Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender a Parent Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in Section 2.4(c)(vi) (along with any unpaid dividends and distributions). 

    

      

    
   

 (c) _ Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ 

    

 (i) _ Common Stock._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws: (A) at the time of the surrender of a Company Certificate for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to surrender) theretofore paid with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto); and (B) at the appropriate payment date, and, without duplicating any payment made under clause (A) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with respect to the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives (less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto). 

  

 (ii) _ Series A Preferred Stock._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock declared or made after the Effective Time with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Series A Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws: (A) at the time of the surrender of a Series A Certificate for exchange in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.5, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date on or prior to surrender) theretofore paid with respect to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive (less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto); and (B) at the appropriate payment date, and, without duplicating any payment made under clause (A) above, there shall be paid to the surrendering holder, without interest, the amount of dividends or other distributions (having a record date after the Effective Time but on or prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender) payable with respect to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder receives (less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required with respect thereto). 

    

 (d) _ No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock._ All shares of Parent Common Stock issued as the Merger Consideration upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (together with any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.5(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued as the Series A Merger Consideration upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the Surviving Corporation\'s stock transfer books of the shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a Company Certificate or Series A Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.5. 

  

 (e) _ Treatment of Fractional Shares._ Fractional shares, if any, of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger to a holder of Series A Preferred Stock in accordance with 

   

      

   
  

Section 2.4(c)(vi), no Parent Certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger to a holder of
Company Common Stock and, except as provided in this Section 2.5(e), Section
2.4(c)(vi) or Section 2.5(c)(ii) no dividend or other distribution, stock
split or interest shall relate to any such fractional share, and except as
provided in Section 2.4(c)(vi) such fractional share shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of Parent.
In lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which a holder of
Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled, such holder, upon surrender
of a Company Certificate as described in this Section 2.5, shall be paid an
amount in cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (i) the Market
Price by (ii) the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled, in which case Parent shall make
available to the Exchange Agent, as part of the Exchange Fund, the amount of
cash necessary to make such payments. The Parties acknowledge that such
payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to a holder of Company Common Stock was not separately bargained
for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting problems that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of such fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock.

  

 (f) _ Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund held by the Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.5 that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for a period of six months following the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand. Thereafter, any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with the provisions of this Section 2.5 shall look only to Parent for payment of their claim for Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (with respect to former holders of Company Common Stock) and any dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock (all without interest). 

  

 (g) _ No Liability._ Neither Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent nor any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock for any amount properly delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock for a period of three years following the Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

  

 (h) _ Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Certificates._ If any Company Certificate or Series A Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Company Certificate or Series A Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claims that may be made against it with respect to such Company Certificate or Series A Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall (i) issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock (along with any cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5(e) and any unpaid dividends and distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Series A Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock (along with any unpaid dividends and distributions pursuant to Section 2.5(c)) deliverable with respect thereto pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

      

   
  

  

 Section 2.6 _ Associated Rights._ References in this Agreement to Company Common Stock shall include, unless the context requires otherwise, the associated rights (the " _Company Rights_ ") issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated as of January 6, 1998 between the Company and Securities Transfer Corporation (the " _Company Rights Agreement_ "). 

  

 Section 2.7 _ Withholding._ Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock (including Company Common Stock held as a result of the conversion of the 1996 Preferred prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 5.26) and any holder of Series A Preferred Stock such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as the case may be, in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be. 

  

 Section 2.8 _ Closing._ The Closing shall take place on the Closing Date at such time and place as is agreed upon by Parent and the Company. 

  

 Section 2.9 _ Effective Time of the Merger._ The Merger shall become effective immediately when the Articles of Merger and any other filings or recordings required under the NRS are accepted for filing by the Secretary of State of Nevada, or at such time thereafter as is provided in the Articles of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). As soon as practicable after the Closing, the Articles of Merger shall be filed, and the Effective Time shall occur, on the Closing Date; provided, however, that the Articles of Merger may be filed prior to the Closing Date or prior to the Closing so long as they provide for an effective time that occurs on the Closing Date immediately after the Closing. 

   

 Section 2.10 _ Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to effectuate the Merger under the NRS as promptly as commercially practicable. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, real estate and other property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of either of Merger Sub or the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized, in the name of the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to take, and shall take, all such lawful and necessary action.

provided, however, that (x) if (under circumstances in which the Company has
complied with all of its obligations under this Section 5.4(a)), prior to this
Agreement having been approved by the Required Company Stockholder Vote (as
herein defined), the Company receives an unsolicited written Takeover Proposal
from a third party that the Board of Directors of the Company determines

reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal (as herein defined), the
Company and its representatives may conduct such additional discussions and
provide such information as the Board of Directors of the Company shall
determine, but only if, prior to such provision of such information or conduct
of such additional discussions (A) such third party shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement in customary form that is no less favorable to the

(3) in compliance with Section 7.3, allow the Company to enter into a binding
written agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior
Proposal, in the case of subclauses (1), (2) and (3) of this clause (y) only
after (A) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after providing Parent and Merger Sub with three business days to propose a
Parent Alternative Transaction (as defined herein) and after consulting with
its financial advisors) that such Takeover Proposal is a Superior Proposal and
(B) the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith
judgment, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, that such
action is required in order for the Board of Directors of the Company to
comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and (z) nothing
contained in subclauses (i) or (ii) above shall prohibit the Company or its
Board of Directors from disclosing to the Company\'s stockholders a position
with respect to any tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in either case to

Parent and Merger Sub with three business days to propose an alternative
transaction, which alternative transaction may be conditioned upon receipt of
further evidence of the ability and intent of the other prospective purchaser
to close (a " _Parent Alternative Transaction_ ")) that such Takeover
Proposal is a Superior Proposal. The Company shall immediately cease and cause
to be terminated and shall cause its affiliates and the Target Companies and
its or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or
agents, to terminate all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with
any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal and shall communicate with any such
parties (and their agents or advisors) in possession of confidential
information regarding any of the Target Companies directing them to return or
destroy such information. The Company shall ensure that its officers,
directors and key employees and its investment bankers, attorneys and other
representatives are aware of and comply with the provisions of this Section.

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " shall mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub or any of their affiliates) relating to any acquisition, merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, direct or indirect business combination, asset acquisition or other similar transaction involving any of the Target Companies of (A) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 10% or more of the total revenue, operating income, EBITDA or assets of the Target Companies, taken as a whole, or (B) 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or any other Company capital stock (or other equity or voting interests in the Company) or capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests in, any of the Target Companies directly or indirectly holding, individually or taken together, the assets or business referred to in clause (A) above, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) the term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide, fully financed written Takeover Proposal to effect a merger, consolidation, reorganization, share exchange, recapitalization, liquidation, direct or indirect business combination, or other similar transaction made by a third party to acquire, directly or indirectly, (x) 50% or more of the assets of the Target Companies, taken as a whole or (y) 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, in any such case on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after consulting with its financial 

  

      

  
  

advisors and outside counsel), taking into account all financial, legal and
regulatory terms and conditions of the Takeover Proposal and this Agreement,
including any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent
through a Parent Alternative Transaction in response to such Takeover
Proposal, including any conditions to such Takeover Proposal, the timing of
the closing thereof, the risk of nonconsummation, the ability of the Person
making the Takeover Proposal to finance the transaction contemplated thereby,
any required governmental or other consents, filings and approvals, (A)
would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more favorable to the
Company\'s stockholders from a financial point of view as compared to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as modified by a Parent
Alternative Transaction) and (B) is reasonably likely to be completed without
undue delay.

  

 (c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 5.4, the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any request for information with respect to any Takeover Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or which could result in a Takeover Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the same.

Parent shall also cause the Company Warrants (if still outstanding and as assumed by Parent) to be approved for listing on a National Stock Exchange prior to the Closing Date. 

  

 Section 5.9 _ Additional Arrangements._ Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of the Company and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all action and shall do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, appropriate or reasonably desirable under any applicable laws and regulations (including the HSR Act) or under applicable governing agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and approvals and effecting all necessary registrations and filings.

shall give prompt notice to Parent of any of the following: (a) any
representation or warranty contained in ARTICLE III being untrue or inaccurate

 Section 5.15 _ Indemnification and Insurance._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification now existing in favor of any officers, directors, employees, controlling stockholders or agents of any of the Target Companies, as provided in their respective charters or bylaws (or similar organizational documents), and any existing indemnification agreements or arrangements of any of the Target Companies, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time (or such longer period as may be provided in any existing indemnification agreement between any of the Target Companies, and any current or former officer or director thereof); provided, that, in the event any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such claims. 

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, for a period of six years after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this Agreement or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent of any of the Target Companies (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, expenses (including attorneys\' fees), claims, damages, liabilities and amounts that are paid in settlement with the approval of the indemnifying party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) of, or otherwise in connection with, any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that the Indemnified Party (or the person controlled by the Indemnified Party) is or was a director, officer, employee, controlling stockholder or agent (including a trustee or fiduciary of any Company Employee Benefit Plan but subject to any conditions or limitations on the indemnity set forth in the applicable Company Employee Benefit Plan) and pertaining to any matter existing or arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including any Claim arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in each case to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Nevada law, and shall pay any expenses, as incurred, in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each 

  

      

  
  

Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Nevada
law. In determining whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Section 5.15, if requested by such Indemnified
Party, such determination shall be made by special, independent counsel
selected by Parent and approved by the Indemnified Party (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed services
for Parent or any of its Affiliates within the last three years (other than in
connection with such matters). Without limiting the foregoing, in the event
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is brought against
any Indemnified Party(ies) (whether arising before or after the Effective
Time): (i) Parent shall have the right to control the defense of such matter
with Parent\'s regularly engaged independent legal counsel or other counsel
selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party(ies),
and Parent shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; and
(ii) the Indemnified Party(ies) shall cooperate with Parent, at Parent\'s
expense, in the defense of any such matter. Parent shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without its prior written consent, which consent shall
not unreasonably be withheld. In the event of any Claim, any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification shall promptly notify Parent thereof
(provided, that failure to so notify Parent shall not affect the obligations
of Parent except to the extent that Parent shall have been prejudiced as a
result of such failure) and shall deliver to Parent the undertaking
contemplated by the applicable provisions of the NRS, but without any
requirement for the posting of a bond. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event any such Claim is brought against any of the Indemnified Parties, such
Indemnified Party(ies) may retain only one law firm (plus one local counsel,
if necessary) to represent them with respect to each such matter unless the
use of counsel chosen to represent the Indemnified Parties would present such
counsel with a conflict of interest, or the representation of all of the
Indemnified Parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual
or reasonably probable differing interests between them, in which case such
additional counsel as may be required (as shall be reasonably determined by
the Indemnified Parties and Parent) may be retained by the Indemnified Parties
at the cost and expense of Parent and Parent shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for such Indemnified Parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 5.15 shall be
deemed to grant any right to any Indemnified Party which is not permitted to
be granted to an officer, director, employee, controlling stockholder or agent
of Parent under applicable Nevada law.

  

 (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions prior to the Effective Time; provided, that (i) Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous; (ii) such substitution shall not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof and if Parent is unable to obtain the insurance required by this Section 5.15(c) it shall obtain as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum amount. 

  

 (d) Following the Merger, if Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person or Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and any of their successors and assigns, assume the obligations of the Parties and Parent set forth in this Section 5.15. 

  

 (e) This Section 5.15 shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time, is intended to benefit the Company and the Indemnified Parties (each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.15) and shall be binding on the successors and assigns of Parent. 

  

      

  
 

  

 Section 5.16 _ Employees; Employee Benefits._ 

  

  

 (a) For a period of six months following the Closing Date, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall, subject to earlier termination of employment for cause (as determined in accordance with the definition of "cause" set forth in the Company\'s Extraordinary Transaction Compensation Policy) or by voluntary termination, continue to provide those Persons (other than Persons currently covered by written employment agreements) who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), with employment at respective levels of base salary and incentive and bonus opportunities (but not equity compensation) and benefits (including vacation, paid time off, medical, dental, vision, life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability benefits) that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate to each Continuing Employee, to those provided by the Target Companies immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that on and after October 1, 2005, each such Continuing Employee may, at the option of Parent, be enrolled in one or more of the Parent Employee Benefit Plans (with benefits of similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries) rather than in any remaining Company Employee Benefit Plans. The Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in Parent\'s 401(k) plan immediately after the Effective Time, according to the terms of Parent\'s 401(k) plan and applicable law, and with the prior service credit provided for in Section 5.16(b). 

  

 (b) The service of each Continuing Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor employer) prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as service with Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of each Parent Employee Benefit Plan (including retirement, vacation, paid time off and severance plans) in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after the Effective Time, including for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals (other than defined benefit pension plan accruals). 

  

 (c) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive any pre-existing condition, exclusion, actively-at-work requirements or waiting periods and (ii) provide full credit for any co-payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the Effective Time (or, if later, any applicable plan transition date) for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or such transition date) occurs, in each case for purposes of each Parent Plan in which any Continuing Employee or his or her eligible dependents is eligible to participate after the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, honor, in accordance with its terms (but without duplication or multiple effect), each severance policy or plan listed on Section 5.16(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and all obligations thereunder, including any rights or benefits arising as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in combination with any other event); provided that the period of time during which severance may be triggered under any severance policy or plan listed on Section 5.16(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (without duplication or multiple effect) shall be extended, with respect to each Continuing Employee to which such policy or plan applies, for the period of such Continuing Employee\'s actual employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries after Closing (up to a maximum extension of six months for all covered participants under the Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. Employee Severance Policy and all covered participants under the Magnum Hunter Resources, Inc. Extraordinary Transaction Compensation Policy who are entitled to receive, as a Termination Payment thereunder, three months or less of Base Salary (as defined therein)). Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a change of control, change in control or extraordinary transaction, as the case may be, for all purposes under such Company Employee Benefit Plans. 

  

      

  
  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall be entitled to (i) amend, modify or terminate any nonqualified deferred compensation plan (as defined in Section 409A of the Code) maintained by any of the Target Companies prior to the Effective Time, as determined by the Company (with the approval of Parent), in order to comply with any rules, regulations or other guidance promulgated by any Governmental Entity under Section 409A of the Code or otherwise to avoid the imposition of any Tax or interest penalty on any participant therein under Section 409A of the Code and (ii) adopt and operate a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that will provide for the deferral of compensation in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2005, in lieu of deferral of such compensation under any nonqualified deferred compensation plan in existence as of the date hereof, and having such other terms and conditions as are substantially similar to the terms of any such existing nonqualified deferred compensation plan and are in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective employees to, take any action or omit to take any action that results, or would be reasonably likely to result, in the imposition of any Tax or interest penalty under Section 409A of the Code on any current or former participant in any such existing or new nonqualified deferred compensation plan, including any "material modification" (within the meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004) of any such nonqualified deferred compensation plan with respect to amounts deferred in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2005. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each such participant on an after-tax basis from any Tax or interest penalty imposed under Section 409A of the Code to the extent imposed as a result of any such act or omission. 

  

 (f) The parties agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "Change in Control" as defined in those employment agreements entered into among the Company, Gruy Petroleum Management Co. and certain executives as identified on Section 5.16(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and that on and after the Effective Time such executives shall have "Good Reason" to voluntarily terminate employment in accordance with such agreements, which termination shall entitle such executives to lump sum termination payments, benefits continuation and other benefits pursuant to Sections 8(c)-(e) of such agreements. The lump sum termination payments payable to the executives upon voluntary termination of employment pursuant to Section 8(c) of the employment agreements are set forth on Section 5.16(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (g) The parties agree that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall constitute a "Change of Control" as defined in the Company\'s Outside Director Policy and that the removal of the Company\'s directors as of the Effective Time as provided in Section 2.3(c) of this Agreement entitles the outside directors of the Company to additional compensation pursuant to Section 3.1 of such policy.

 Section 5.20 _ Tax Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each, and shall cause its respective subsidiaries to, use its reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.3(c). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree to file all Tax Returns consistent with the treatment of the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). 

  

 (b) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver to Thompson and Knight LLP, Tax counsel for the Company, and Holme Roberts and Owen LLP, Tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the Parties and such law firms

including prior to the time the Registration Statement is declared effective
by the SEC and the Effective Time, in connection with such Tax counsel\'s
respective delivery of opinions pursuant to Section 6.2(d) and Section 6.3(c).
Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be

to be untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
certificates described in this Section 5.20.

  

  

 Section 5.21 _ Termination of the Company Stock Ownership Plan._ The Company sponsors and maintains the Company 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the " _KSOP_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take all such action as may be necessary to terminate the KSOP effective as of a date prior to the Closing Date. As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the current trustee of the KSOP shall be replaced by a qualified institutional trustee selected by the Company and acceptable to Parent. On or prior to the termination date, the new trustee of the KSOP shall cause the KSOP to repay any existing loan(s) of the KSOP (in accordance with the terms of the loan, the terms of the KSOP, applicable law and in a manner mutually acceptable to the Company and Parent) and the plan administrator shall allocate any unallocated assets remaining after the loan is repaid in accordance with the terms of the KSOP document and applicable law. Upon the termination date, the accounts of all participants affected by the termination shall become fully vested and the plan administrator of the KSOP shall direct the trustee of the trust related to the KSOP to distribute the assets remaining in the trust, after payment of any expenses properly allocable thereto and after receipt of a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the termination of the KSOP will not adversely affect its qualified status, to participants and beneficiaries in proportion to their respective account balances; provided, however, that distributions will not be delayed until after receipt of a favorable determination letter with respect to those participants who are otherwise entitled to a distribution under the KSOP by reason of death, disability, retirement, termination of employment or any other reason permitted under the terms of the KSOP (other than plan termination). Except as otherwise provided in the KSOP, any distributions made after termination of the KSOP may be made, in whole or in part, in cash or in kind; provided, however, that participants shall have the right, as provided in the KSOP document, to demand payment from their vested KSOP Accounts under the KSOP in the form of Company Common Stock or if the distribution occurs after the Closing Date, Parent Common Stock (except to the extent of the value of any factional shares, which shall be distributed in cash). The termination of the KSOP and the exercise of all rights, including but not limited to voting, appurtenant to Company stock in the KSOP shall be effected in a manner mutually acceptable to Company and Parent. Parent agrees to take all such action as may be necessary to permit rollovers of participant distributions from the KSOP to a defined contribution plan maintained by Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, provided that such defined contribution plan shall be required to accept a direct rollover in kind only to the extent permitted under the terms of such plan. 

  

 Section 5.22 _ SOX 404 Certification._ Each of the Company and Parent shall complete and include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2004, management\'s assessment of the Company\'s internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of SOX.

 Section 5.24 _ Dividend of TEL Offshore Trust Units._ 

  

  

 (a) Prior to the tenth day before the date of the Company Meeting, the Board of Directors of the Company may declare a distribution (the " _TEL Distribution_ ") of trust units of TEL Offshore 

  

      

  

Trust (the " _TEL Units_ ") to the holders of Company Common Stock, with each
share of Company Common Stock entitled to receive that number of TEL
Units equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the number of TEL Units
owned by the Company on the TEL Distribution Record Date by the number of then
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock; provided, however, that the
Company may pay cash in lieu of fractional TEL Units or, in any jurisdiction
in which the Company reasonably determines on the advice of counsel that
distribution of the TEL Units is inadvisable under applicable state "blue
sky" laws (provided, that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
beginning as soon as practicable following the date hereof to pursue
diligently appropriate registrations or exemptions in such jurisdictions) or
will likely delay the distribution of the TEL Units beyond the Effective Time.
In the event of any stock split, combination, reclassification, share
dividend or other event similarly altering or affecting the value of TEL
Units, the foregoing shall be adjusted to the extent deemed appropriate by the
Board of Directors of the Company, and subject to the reasonable approval of
Parent, to accomplish the purposes hereof. The resolutions of the Board of
Directors declaring the TEL Distribution and setting forth the terms and
conditions described above shall in form and substance be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

  

 (b) The TEL Distribution shall occur on a date, if at all, prior to the Effective Time and be payable to the holders of record of Company Common Stock at the close of business on the record date fixed by the Company\'s Board of Directors for the TEL Distribution (the " _TEL Distribution Record Date_ "). 

  

  

 Section 5.25 _ Company Debt Instruments._ 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, in accordance with the applicable provisions of each of the indentures relating to the Company Convertible Notes and the Company Senior Secured Notes (such Company Convertible Notes and Company Senior Secured Notes, collectively, the " _Notes_ " and such indentures, collectively, the " _Indentures_ "), to the trustee under each such Indenture and to each Holder (as defined in each respective Indenture), any notices required by the Indentures by virtue of a Change of Control (as defined in each Indenture). 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, on the Closing Date, execute such supplemental indentures to the Indentures as are required under the Indentures. 

  

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall take all such further actions, including the delivery of any officers\' certificates and opinions of counsel required by the Indentures, as may be necessary to comply with all of the terms and conditions of the Indentures. 

   

 (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to all Holders the notices required by the Indentures with respect to the right of the Holders to require repurchase of the Notes and or the conversion thereof upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, and thereafter Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall comply with all other provisions of the Indentures relating to the right of Holders to require repurchase of the Notes and/or the conversion thereof. 

  

  

 Section 5.26 _ Conversion of 1996 Preferred._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries that is Controlled By the Company and who owns shares of 1996 Preferred to convert all of the issued and outstanding shares of the 1996 Preferred into shares of Company Common Stock, pursuant to the terms set forth in the certificate of designations for the 1996 Preferred.

 Section 8.4 _ Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 Section 8.5 _ Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. This Section shall be subject to Section 8.8. 

  

 Section 8.6 _ Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries._ This Agreement (together with the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered by the Parties in connection with this Agreement): (a) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (b) except as provided in ARTICLE II and Section 5.3(c), Section 5.3(d), Section 5.15, Section 5.16, and Section 5.18, is solely for the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors, legal representatives and assigns and does not confer on any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 Section 8.7 _ Applicable Law._ This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation and effect, by the laws of the State of Delaware regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof. 

   

 Section 8.8 _ No Remedy in Certain Circumstances._ Each Party agrees that, should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of this Agreement or part hereof to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any Party to take any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining 

        
  

provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not in any way
be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent action or
the failure to take any action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall terminate pursuant to ARTICLE VII. Except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent that a Party took an action
inconsistent herewith or failed to take action consistent herewith or required
hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a court or other competent
Governmental Authority, such Party shall not incur any liability or obligation
unless such Party breached its obligations under Section 5.9 or did not in
good faith seek to resist or object to the imposition or entering of such
order or judgment.

   

 Section 8.9 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 8.10 _ Waivers._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Parties may, to the extent legally allowed: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive performance of any of the covenants or agreements, or satisfaction of any of the conditions, contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of such Party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any Party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of compliance with, or reliance on, any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any Party of a breach of any provision hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof. 

  

 Section 8.11 _ Confidentiality Agreement._ The Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect following the execution of this Agreement until terminated as described in Section 7.2, is hereby incorporated herein by reference, and shall constitute a part of this Agreement for all purposes; provided, however, that any standstill provisions contained therein shall, effective as of the Closing, be deemed to have been waived to the extent necessary for the Parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Any and all information received by Parent and the Company pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.12 _ Incorporation._ Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are attached to and by this reference incorporated herein for all purposes.
