having occurred, the Seller and the Purchaser shall agree to a transfer of
the PLTA Shareholder Loan to the Purchaser ( _Vertrags_ _u_ _bernahme_ ) with
all rights and obligations pertaining thereto (including accrued interest
thereon as of the Closing Date). The Purchaser shall procure ( _steht daf_

tax ( _Kapitalertragsteuer_ ) for the reason that in the view of such Tax
Authority based on a respective notice the profit distribution with respect
to the settlement of the PLTA Profit Transfer Claim under this _Section_ __ _
5.3.3_ is attributable to the Purchaser, Purchaser shall be obliged to repay
to the Seller the relevant amount of German withholding tax (

request of the Seller.

request of the Seller, by way of actual payment to EMP for the account and on
behalf of the Seller, any and all claims of EMP against the Seller in

extent that the Seller receives after the Closing Date a payment by EMP
(other than any payment under the PLTA Profit Transfer Claim which shall
exclusively be dealt with under _Section_ __ _ 5.3.3_ above and/or any
payment under the Existing Profit Transfer Claim to the extent the Existing
Profit Transfer Claim is not settled prior to the Closing Date) in connection
with the PLTA, the Seller shall pay an amount equal to such amount actually
received from EMP plus the amount of German withholding tax (
_Kapitalertragsteuer_ ), if any, which EMP withheld and paid to the Tax
Authorities with respect to such amount for the account of the Seller to the 

---|---|--- 
 



17

         |  Purchaser. Any payment by the Purchaser and/or the Seller, as

relation to any periods up to the Closing Date and (ii) the Tax returns and
the financial statements of EMP for any periods up to the Closing Date shall
not be amended to the extent, in regards to financial statements of EMP, this
would cause a liability of the Seller to compensate additional losses or to
repay any profits received under the PLTA, except for any amendments which are
mandatory under applicable law or which are required by the Tax Authorities
to be made pursuant to a binding Tax assessment to Tax returns in order to
reflect findings of a Tax Audit. Upon the request of the Seller, the Purchaser
shall cause EMP to file objections and appeals against any such Tax assessment
in accordance with the Sellers directions. The Purchaser shall and shall
procure ( _steht daf_ _u_ _r ein_ ) that EMP shall not agree, settle, waive or

entitled pursuant to Section 303 of the German Stock Corporation Act ( _AktG_
) as a result of the termination of the PLTA and (ii) ensure that any such

     | (iii) |

at any later point in time, any then still remaining Retained Escrow Funds, if
and to the extent the then still remaining Retained Escrow Funds have been
retained based on a claim notice (and not a filed lawsuit or request for

as compared to other similarly situated companies that conduct business in
the industries and markets in which the EMP Group Companies conduct the

shall be taken into account when determining whether a Closing Material
Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur);

since the Signing Date, no event, condition, change, development,
circumstance, effect or state of facts shall have occurred that, individually

below) owned or purported to be owned by an EMP Group Company
(the "Registered EMP Intellectual Property"). _Schedule_ __ _ 14.9.1-2_ sets

interest to use such Licensed Intellectual Property. Any such licenses or
other agreements which have a value or expected value of less than EUR 100,000
(in words: Euro one hundred thousand) do not have to be made part of
_Schedule_ __ _ 14.9.1-2_. Registered EMP Intellectual Property and Licensed
Intellectual Property are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Material
IP Rights". "Intellectual Property" means all intellectual property in any and
all jurisdictions worldwide, including (a) all patents, patent applications,

to conduct the Business as presently conducted. The execution of this
Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereunder 

---|---|--- 
 



51

         |  will not result in the termination or any material alteration
of the EMP Group Companies rights or title to or interest in any Material IP
Rights, and will not immediately following such consummation result in any
licenses, encumbrances, liens, pledges, assignments or other rights being
granted under or imposed on any Material IP Rights. 
---|--- 



     | 14.9.3 |

_Ownership of Intellectual Property_. Except for the Financing Security, the

granted to or held by any third party, except for non-exclusive licenses
granted by an EMP Group Company in the ordinary course of business or any non-

Property under German Copyright Act ( _Urheberrechtsgesetz_ ).

Property and, to the Sellers Knowledge, all Licensed Intellectual Property,
is valid, subsisting and enforceable, and not subject to any outstanding
order, judgment, injunction, decree, ruling or agreement adversely affecting

validity or enforceability thereof. All Registered EMP Intellectual Property
and, to the Sellers Knowledge, all Licensed Intellectual Property, is in
compliance with all formal legal requirements necessary to record and perfect
the relevant EMP Group Companys or licensors interest therein, and to
maintain the validity and enforceability thereof. There are no actions pending
or asserted, or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened, concerning any EMP
Intellectual Property, or, to the Sellers Knowledge, any Licensed
Intellectual Property, contesting or challenging the ownership, validity or
enforceability thereof, or any EMP Group Companys right to use such
Intellectual Property. 

---|---|--- 



     | 14.9.5 |

_Non-Infringement_. To the Sellers Knowledge, the conduct of the Business by
the EMP Group Companies as currently conducted, including the use of the
Material IP Rights, in connection therewith, and the products and services of
the EMP Group Companies, do not infringe or otherwise violate the
Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the Sellers Knowledge,
no third party has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the
Material IP Rights. There are no actions pending or asserted, or, to the
Sellers Knowledge, threatened (including in the form of offers to obtain a
license), (a) alleging any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation

         |  third party; or (b) by any EMP Group Company alleging any
infringement, misappropriation, or other violation by any third party of the
EMP Intellectual Property or Licensed Intellectual Property. To the Sellers
Knowledge, there are no facts or circumstances that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any such action described in this _Section_ __ _
14.9.5_.

licenses, consents, releases, settlements, coexistence agreements, covenants
not to sue, permissions and all other contracts and agreements, whether
written or oral, relating to Intellectual Property to which any EMP Group
Company is a party, beneficiary, or otherwise bound (a) under which any EMP
Group Company is a licensor or otherwise grants to any third party any right
or interest relating to any EMP Intellectual Property; (b) under which any EMP
Group Company is a licensee or otherwise granted any right or interest
relating to third-party Intellectual Property that is not Licensed
Intellectual Property disclosed in _Schedule 14.9.1-2_ (and other than
unmodified licenses for commercial "off-the-shelf" or "shrink-wrap"
software); and (c) which otherwise relate to any EMP Group Companys ownership
or use of Intellectual Property, in each case with respect to clauses (a),
(b) and (c) exceeding a value or expected value of EUR 100,000 (in words: Euro

Group Company that is party thereto in accordance with its terms and is in
full force and effect. No EMP Group Company, nor, to the Sellers Knowledge,
any other party thereto, is or is alleged to be in breach or default under, or
has provided or received any notice of breach of, default under or intention
to terminate (including by non-renewal), any EMP IP Agreement.

Agreements"). A Managing Director whose existing service agreement has been
replaced by a new Service Agreement with EMP shall be deemed a "Transferred
Employee" and a Managing Director whose existing service agreement has not

expenses (including Taxes, reasonable legal fees, expenses and disbursements)
arising out of or in connection with the termination of the employment
relationships of any Retained Employees, including reasonable severance
payments provided that the Purchaser has given its prior written consent to

assumption of contract ( _Vertrags_ _u_ _bernahme_ ), provided that the Seller
shall not be obliged to bear any costs relating to such assumption of the
Insurance Agreements. 

---|---|--- 



     | 17.1.2 |

In the event that the Seller does not receive a third party consent required
for the transfer of the Insurance Agreements along with all rights and
obligations by way of outright transfer in the form of assumption of contract
( _Vertrags ubernahme_), following the Sellers reasonable best efforts to
obtain such a third party consent, the Seller may, in its reasonable
discretion, to be effective as of the Closing Date, amend any insurance
policies in the manner it deems appropriate to give effect to this _Section_
__ _ 17.1.2_; provided, that neither the Seller nor any Sellers Group
Company may take any action that would reduce, modify or eliminate any
coverage, terms and conditions or policy limits to the detriment of the
Purchaser under any insurance policy presently available to the Purchaser for
any claims related to pre-Closing occurrences; provided, further, that, (i)
Purchaser shall, to the extent permissible under the Insurance Agreements,
continue to have the benefits of any such available insurance, exercisable by
requesting that the Seller and any respective Sellers Group Company make
claims under such policies with respect to losses occurring (whether known or
unknown) before the Closing Date, to the extent insurance coverage in respect
of such claims may be available, (ii) the Seller and the respective Sellers
Group Company shall diligently pursue such claims, consult with the Purchaser
prior to making any material decision or taking any material action relating
to such claim and take such other actions as may be reasonably requested by
the Purchaser in connection with the tendering of such claims to the
applicable insurers under such policies, and (iii) the Seller and the
respective Sellers Group Company shall provide the Purchaser with the net
proceeds they realize with respect to such claims; provided, further, that (A)
the Purchaser shall be liable for all uninsured or  

---|---|--- 
 



77

         |  self-insured amounts in respect of such claims and (B) the
Purchaser agrees to reimburse, upon the request of the Seller or the
applicable Sellers Group Company for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by the
Seller or such Sellers Group Company associated with Purchaser-initiated
claims, including costs of filing a claim, arbitration costs, any deductibles
and premium increases under the insurance policies and programs resulting from
such claims. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall be responsible
for securing all insurance it considers appropriate for its operation of the
Business. 
---|--- 



   17.2 |

Payroll Administration 

---|--- 
 



     | 17.2.1 |

The Seller shall transfer to the Purchaser (or its designated Affiliate) with
legal effect as of the Closing Date the service agreement for payroll
administration further set out in _Exhibit 17.2.1_ (the "Payroll
Administration Agreement") along with all rights and obligations by way of
outright transfer in the form of assumption of contract ( _Vertrags_ _u_
_bernahme_ ) subject to any third party consents. In relation to the Payroll
Administration Agreement, the Purchaser undertakes to enter into such
agreements and documents and do all acts as are required to effect the
assumption of contract ( _Vertrags_ _u_ _bernahme_ ), provided that the Seller
shall not be obliged to bear any costs relating to such assumption of the
Payroll Administration Agreement.  

---|---|--- 



     | 17.2.2 |

In the event that the Seller does not receive a third party consent required
for the transfer of the Payroll Administration Agreement along with all
rights and obligations by way of outright transfer in the form of assumption
of contract ( _Vertrags_ _u_ _bernahme_ ), the Seller, EMP and the Purchaser
shall (i) following the Closing Date, and for a period of six (6) months
thereafter, use reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable
such third party consent, and (ii) during such period cooperate to establish
an agency type or other similar arrangement reasonably satisfactory to the
Seller and the Purchaser under which EMP (or its designated Affiliate) would
obtain, to the fullest extent practicable and not prohibited by any applicable
law, the claims, rights and benefits and assume the corresponding liabilities
under the Payroll Administration Agreement (including by means of any
subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing arrangement or through a new
relationship with the provider or an agreement with a replacement provider,
in each case, to provide the Parties the economic and operational equivalent,
to the extent permitted, of obtaining such third party consent) at the costs
and expenses of the Purchaser and further; provided, however, that in no event
shall any Party or their respective Affiliates be obligated to make any
payments in order to obtain any consent or approval described in this
_Section_ __ _ 17.2.2_. 

---|---|--- 
 



78

       17.3 |

Lease Agreement 

---|--- 
 

The Seller shall procure ( _steht daf ur ein_) that the office lease agreement
currently in effect between the Seller as lessee and EMP as lessor shall be
terminated and cancelled as of the Closing Date without any costs, liability,
charges or expenses on EMP or any other EMP Group Company.



   17.4 |

Non-Solicitation 

---|--- 
 

The Seller and its Affiliates undertake for a period of (i) twenty-four (24)
months from the Closing Date with respect to the individuals listed on
_Exhibit 17.4_ and (ii) twelve (12) months from the Closing Date with respect
to any other managing director, current or future director, officer or
employee of the EMP Group Companies, not to solicit, and to procure that no
Sellers Related Person solicits, whether alone, jointly, or with another
person, directly or indirectly, on their own behalf or on behalf of a third
party, whether for their own or for a third partys account in any way, any
such individual or managing director, current or future director, officer or
employee of the EMP Group Companies described in the preceding clauses (i) and
(ii), for employment or service or with respect to a termination or
violation of such persons existing relationship with any EMP Group Company.
Nothing shall, however, prevent the Seller or any Sellers Related Person from
hiring any such person:

 



     | 17.4.1 |

who applies for any position with the Seller or any Sellers Related Person
(without solicitation by the Seller or such Sellers Related Person) that is
advertised publicly and not targeted at individual prospective employees who
are or were employed by any EMP Group Company; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 17.4.2 |

whose employment or position has been terminated by any EMP Group Company for
any reason after the Closing Date; or 

---|---|--- 



     | 17.4.3 |

whose employment with any EMP Group Company ceased twelve (12) months or more
before the date of his or her employment by either of the Seller or any
Sellers Related Person. 

---|---|--- 



   18 |

Purchasers Remedies 

---|--- 
 



   18.1 |

Breach; Losses; Special Indemnities 

---|--- 
 



     | 18.1.1 |

_Consequences of Breach_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
18.1.1_, in the event of any breach or non-fulfillment by the Seller of any
of the Sellers Warranties and/or the Bring Down Covenant (the "Breach"), the
Seller shall, at the Purchasers election (i) put the Purchaser, or at the
Purchasers election, the relevant EMP Group Company, into the position 

---|---|--- 
 



79

         |  that it would have been in if the Breach had not occurred (
_Naturalrestitution_ ), provided that such restitution in kind is possible and
further provided that the value of any such for the restitution in kind so
received shall count against the Indemnity Escrow Amount, or (ii) pay to the
Purchaser or, at the Purchasers election, the relevant EMP Group Company
compensation in cash ( _Schadensersatz in Geld_ ) for any Losses incurred by
the Purchaser or the relevant EMP Group Company arising from such Breach (the
"Purchaser Claim"). 
---|--- 



     | 18.1.2 |

_Definition of Losses_. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Losses" shall be
determined using the legal principles of calculation of damages, mitigation
of damages and off-setting of losses by advantages ( _Schadensberechnung,
Schadens_ _minderung, Vorteilsausgleich_ ) pursuant to Sections 249 _et seq_.
BGB but shall exclude any consequential damages ( _Folgesch_ _a_ _den_ ) and
lost profits ( _entgangener Gewinn_ ) unless to the extent covered by the
purpose and intent of the Sellers Warranty that has been breached ( _vom
Sinn und Zweck der verletzten Garantie erfasst_ ) or any internal
administration and overhead costs. The limitations under this _Section_ __ _
18.1.2_ regarding the determination of the liability of the Seller shall not
apply in case of a willful ( _vors_ _a_ _tzlich_ ) breach of the Sellers
obligations under this Agreement. 

---|---|--- 



     | 18.1.3 |

_Seller Transaction Expenses_ _Indemnity_. Notwithstanding the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 18.2_, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the EMP Group Companies following the
Closing) for any Losses suffered, incurred or resulting from any
Seller Transaction Expenses that remain unpaid by the Seller following the
Closing and are not reflected in the determination of the Purchase Price. 

---|---|--- 



   18.2 |

Exclusion of Liability 

---|--- 
 

The Seller shall not be liable for, and the Purchaser shall not be entitled to
bring, any Purchaser Claim or, where applicable, any other claim under or in
connection with this Agreement if and to the extent that:



     | 18.2.1 |

the Purchaser or any of the EMP Group Companies, or any successor to all or
parts of their business has actually received repayment, reimbursement,
indemnification or has otherwise recovered from a third party (other than any
of the EMP Group Companies), including under any insurance policy, maintained
by the relevant EMP Group Company, in force until the Closing Date which is
not terminated automatically upon Closing; 

---|---|--- 



     | 18.2.2 |

the matter to which the Purchaser Claim relates has been expressly taken into
account in (i) the Final Closing Statement binding upon the Parties, 

---|---|--- 
 



80

         |  (ii) the 2017 Accounts by way of a specific provision ( _R
uckstellung_), liability ( _Verbindlichkeit_ ), exceptional depreciation ( _au
ßerplanmaßige Abschreibung_) or depreciation to reflect lower market values (
_Abschreibung auf den niedrigeren beizulegenden Wert_ ), in each case
reasonably associated with the matter in question and evident; 
---|--- 
 



     | 18.2.3 |

the facts and circumstances underlying the Breach were Fairly Disclosed and
actually known ( _positive Kenntnis_ ) by the managing directors of the
Purchaser as well as of the persons listed in _Exhibit _ _18.2.3_ as of the
Signing Date; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 18.2.4 |

the Purchaser Claim results from or is increased by, the passing of, or any
change in, any law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, common law rule or
administrative practice of any governmental authority after the Signing Date; 

---|---|--- 



     | 18.2.5 |

subject to _Section_ __ _ 19.1.3_, the Breach or the respective Losses are
attributable to the change of control over the EMP Group Companies in the
course of, or otherwise caused by, the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, provided that the relevant documentation that contains the relevant
change of control clause has been Fairly Disclosed. 

---|---|--- 

"Fairly Disclosed" means that events, information or documents were disclosed
in such a manner which allowed a prudent business person, from an objective
perspective and applying customary due diligence standards for similar
transactions in the same circumstances as the Purchaser, who was permitted to
review the same, to make a reasonably informed assessment of such a deviation
from the relevant Sellers Warranty and of the potential impact thereof on the
EMP Group Companies; provided, that events, information or documents contained
in a Schedule relating to a specific Sellers Warranty shall also be deemed
to be Fairly Disclosed for the purposes of another Sellers Warranty, if their
relevance with regard to such Sellers Warranty is reasonably apparent on the
face of such disclosure. The provisions of Section 442 BGB and Section 377
German Commercial Code ( _HGB_ ) shall not apply.



   18.3 |

Breach Notice 

---|--- 
 

If the Purchaser after the Closing becomes aware of any facts or circumstances
which constitute, or are reasonably likely to constitute, a Breach, the
Purchaser shall give the Seller written notice thereof as soon as reasonably
practicable, in any case no later than one (1) month after the Purchaser has
discovered the facts and circumstances underlying such Purchaser Claim.

 



81

       18.4 |

De Minimis; Basket 

---|--- 



      | 18.4.1 |

A Breach of Sellers Warranties (other than Title Warranties or Fundamental
Warranties) or the Bring Down Covenant shall only give rise to a Purchaser
Claim against the Seller: 

---|---|--- 



     | (a) |

if the amount to which the Purchaser is entitled  _vis-_ _a_ _ -vis_ the
Seller under such individual claim, or an individual series of such claims
related to the same or comparable underlying circumstances ( _gleicher
Lebenssachverhalt_ ) exceeds EUR 155,000.00 (in words: Euro one hundred and
fifty-five thousand) (the "De Minimis") in which case the Seller shall be
liable for the entire amount and not just for the portion exceeding the De
Minimis ( _Freigrenze_ ); and 

---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

if and to the extent the aggregate amount of all Purchaser Claims based on
Breaches to which the Purchaser is entitled _vis-_ _a_ _ -vis_ the Seller, to
which this _Section_ __ _ 18.4_ applies and which are not excluded pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 18.4.1(a)_ exceeds EUR 1,550,000.00 (in words: Euro one
million five hundred and fifty thousand) (the "Basket"), in which case the
Seller shall be liable for the entire amounts and not just the portion
exceeding the Basket ( _Freigrenze_ ). 

---|---|--- 



     | 18.4.2 |

For both purposes under this _Section_ __ _ 18_ of determining the amount of
Losses in the event of a Breach, and for purposes of determining whether a
Breach has occurred, no effect shall be given to any materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or similar materiality qualifications contained in any of the
Sellers Warranties (other than the representations and warranties contained
in _Sections_ __ _ 14.7_ and _14.22_ ). 

---|---|--- 



   18.5 |

Limitation Periods 

---|--- 
 

Any claims of the Purchaser under or in connection with this Agreement shall
become time-barred ( _verj ahren_) unless notice of such claim has been
provided by the Purchaser prior to the time period set forth below in the case
of which (i) the limitation shall be tolled only for the claim for which
notice was given and (ii) such claim shall then be time-barred twelve (12)
months after the notice has been given unless the Purchaser has initiated
arbitration proceedings with respect to such claim prior to such point in
time:



     | (a) |

in case of the Purchaser Claims due to Breach of Title Warranties or
Fundamental Warranties, which shall become time-barred four (4) years after
the Closing Date; 

---|---|--- 
 



82

         | (b) |

claims arising as a result of willful breaches ( _Vorsatz_ ) or fraud (
_Arglist_ ) which shall become time-barred pursuant to statutory law. Section
203 BGB shall not apply unless the Parties agree in writing that the expiry
period shall be tolled ( _gehemmt_ ) on the basis of pending settlement
negotiations; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (c) |

claims for a breach of a Sellers Covenant which shall become time-barred (
_verj ahren_) nine (9) months after the Closing Date; 

---|---|--- 



     | (d) |

claims under _Section_ __ _ 17.4_ which shall become time-barred ( _verj
ahren_) three (3) months after the lapse of the 24-months period or the
twelve-months period, as the case may, under _Section_ __ _ 17.4_; 

---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) |

all Insured Claims (except for the Title Warranties and the Fundamental
Warranties) which shall become time-barred ( _verj ahren_) fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date; and 

---|---|--- 



     | (f) |

all other claims of the Purchaser (including with respect to a Breach of the
Bring Down Covenant), on the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the Closing
Date. 

---|---|--- 



   18.6 |

WandI Insurance Recourse 

---|--- 
 



     | 18.6.1 |

_W andI Insurance_. The Purchaser confirms and represents to the Seller that it
has taken out warranty and indemnity insurance under an insurance policy a
copy of which is attached hereto in _Exhibit 18.6.1_ , (the "WandI Insurance"
and the relevant insurance provider(s) as therein identified (collectively),
the "Insurer"). The Purchaser shall refrain from any actions or omissions
that adversely affect its coverage position under, or the continuation of, the
WandI Insurance. 

---|---|--- 
 



     | 18.6.2 |

_Warranty Liability Cap_. Any liability of Seller for Purchaser Claims based
on Breaches of the Sellers Warranties, including Fundamental Warranties,
and/or a Breach of the Bring Down Covenant (collectively, the "Insured
Claims") shall in no event exceed EUR 3,100,000.00 (in words: Euro three
million one hundred thousand) (the "Warranty Liability Cap"). Consequently,
the Purchasers sole recourse for the Insured Claims beyond the Warranty
Liability Cap shall be against the Insurer and the Purchaser shall not bring
any Insured Claims beyond the Warranty Liability Cap against the Seller. The
Purchaser expressly acknowledges, and the Parties agree, that the validity and
collectability risk in respect of the WandI Insurance shall solely and
irrevocably rest with the Purchaser, and that the Warranty Liability Cap
contained herein shall apply notwithstanding any 

---|---|--- 
 



83

         |  subsequent non-payment under the WandI Insurance or any vitiation
or expiry or termination thereof. 
---|--- 
 



   18.7 |

Excess Recoveries 

---|--- 
 

If the Purchaser recovers from a third party for Losses for which it (or the
relevant EMP Group Company) was already compensated in whole or in part by
the Seller under or in connection with this Agreement, the Purchaser
undertakes to pay to the Seller the amount of such excess recovery up to the
amount actually received from the Seller within ten (10) Business Days of its
receipt. 



   18.8 |

No Double Dip; Treatment of Claim Compensation 

---|--- 
 

The Purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claims against the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement if and to the extent any such claimed amount has
been taken into account in the Final Closing Statement which has become
binding upon the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers remedies under
or in connection with this Agreement which relate to the same facts
or circumstances ( _Lebenssachverhalt_ ) shall be limited to the specific
remedies set forth herein and under no circumstances shall the Seller be
entitled to claim Losses for the same facts and circumstances more than once.
Any payments made by Seller to Purchaser or the EMP Group Companies for any
Purchaser Claim or any other claims under or in connection with this Agreement
shall be deemed to be an adjustment of the Purchase Price.

 



   18.9 |

No Additional Rights or Remedies 

---|--- 
 



     | 18.9.1 |

_Exclusive Remedies_. The remedies which the Purchaser may have against the
Seller under or in connection with this Agreement, including for Breaches of
any of the Sellers Warranties or any other agreements or undertakings set
forth in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies available to the
Purchaser in respect to the Seller. If and to the extent permitted by law,
any claims and remedies other than those explicitly provided for in this
Agreement, including for such Breaches, regardless of their nature, amount or
legal basis, are hereby expressly excluded and waived by the Purchaser, such
waiver hereby being accepted by the Seller, save and except for primary claims
( _prim_ _a_ _re_ _Erf_ _u_ _llungsanspr_ _u_ _che_ ) and claims for non-
fulfillment of such claims. 

---|---|--- 



     | 18.9.2 |

_No Other Remedies_. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _
18.9.1_ above, in particular, any right of the Purchaser to lower the
Purchase Price or any portion thereof ( _Minderung_ ), to withdraw ( _R_ _u_
_cktritt_ ) from this Agreement (with _Section_ __ _ 13.1_ above
remaining unaffected) or to require the winding up of the transactions
contemplated hereunder on any other legal basis ( _e.g._ , by way of so-called
_gro_ _ß_ _er Schadenersatz_ ) shall be excluded  

---|---|--- 
 



84

         |  and waived ( _Verzicht_ ) by the Purchaser in its entirety.
Further, (i) any claim for breach of pre-contractual obligations ( _culpa
in contrahendo_ ), including claims arising under Sections 241 para. 2, 311
para. 2 and 3 BGB or ancillary obligations ( _Nebenpflichten_ ), including
claims arising under Sections 241 para. 2, 280 BGB, (ii) any claims based on
frustration of contract ( _St_ _o_ _rung der Gesch_ _a_ _ftsgrundlage_ )
pursuant to Section 313 BGB, (iii) all remedies of the Purchaser for defect of
the purchased object including claims arising under Sections 437 through 441
BGB and (iv) the right to rescind ( _Anfechtung_ ) this Agreement are hereby
also expressly excluded and waived ( _Verzicht_ ) by the Purchaser in its
entirety. If and to the extent the exclusion of claims based on frustration
of contract ( _St_ _o_ _rung der Gesch_ _a_ _ftsgrundlage_ ) is, despite the
risk allocation agreed upon between the Parties in this Agreement, held
invalid, such exclusion shall be construed, to the extent
legally permissible, to set the thresholds for such principles to apply
particularly high and to limit respective remedies to adjustment of this
Agreement under exclusion of the right to withdraw ( _R_ _u_ _cktritt_ ). 
---|--- 
 



     | 18.9.3 |

_Willful Deceit; Willful Misconduct_. This _Section_ __ _ 18.9_ as well as
any other limitations and exclusions of liability pursuant to this Agreement
shall not apply to any rights and remedies for willful deceit ( _arglistige T_
_a_ _uschung_ ) by the Seller or the Sellers own willful misconduct (
_Vorsatz_ ), in which case statutory law shall apply. 

---|---|--- 



   18.10 |

If and to the extent Seller is liable for a Breach of _Section_ __ _
14.20.3_, the Purchaser shall cause the relevant EMP Group Company to assign
to the Seller (or its designated Affiliate) any claim for compensation,
reimbursement or otherwise against a third party as a result of the secondary
obligation which has caused the Breach.  

---|--- 



   19 |

Cooperation on Tax Matters 

---|--- 
 

The Seller and the Purchaser shall provide each other with such corporation
and information as either of them may reasonably request in respect of Taxes
of the EMP Group Companies relating to any taxable period or portion thereof
ending on or before the Closing Date if and to the extent that (i) one or the
other Party needs such corporation or information to handle their Tax matters
after the Closing or (ii) such cooperation or information is relevant for any
claim a Party may have under this Agreement. Such corporation and information
shall include providing copies of relevant Tax returns or Tax assessment
notices and other documents received from any Tax Authority by any Party.

the meaning of Section 311 BGB that the statements in this _Section_ __ _ 20_
(the "Purchasers Warranties") are correct as of the Signing Date and the
Closing Date, unless it is specifically provided that a Purchasers Warranty
is made as of a different or additional date or dates, in which case such
Purchasers Warranty shall be correct as of such different or additional date
or dates.

judicial proceeding, legal document, legal status, court, official or any

---|---|--- 



     | 24.9.2 |

ordinary courts of law. In addition to the foregoing arbitration rules, the
Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration of the
International Bar Association shall apply; provided, that the arbitral
tribunal shall decide matters of privilege based on what is fair and
equitable taking into account recognized principles such as lawyer-client
communication and attorney-work privilege (including, in each case, with
respect to in-house lawyers). The place of arbitration shall be Frankfurt am
Main. The 

---|---|--- 
 



94

         |  language of the arbitral proceedings shall be English,
provided, however, that written evidence may be submitted in either the

---|--- 
 



     | 24.9.3 |

_Alternative Venue_. In the event that mandatory applicable law requires any
matter arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and its execution
to be decided upon by an ordinary court of law, to the extent legally
permissible, the competent courts in Frankfurt am Main shall have exclusive
jurisdiction. 

---|---|--- 
 



   24.10 |

Severability 

---|--- 
 

If any court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement
invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be
deemed to have been replaced by a valid, enforceable and fair provision which
comes as close as possible to the intentions of the Parties hereto at the time
of the conclusion of this Agreement. It is the express intent of the Parties
that the validity and enforceability of all other provisions of this Agreement
shall be maintained and that this _Section_ __ _ 24.10_ shall not result in
a reversal of the burden of proof but that Section 139 BGB is hereby excluded
in its entirety.
