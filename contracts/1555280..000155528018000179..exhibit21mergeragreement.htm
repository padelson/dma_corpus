Business Day following the date on which each of the conditions set forth in
Article VII is satisfied, or to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waived
by the party entitled to waive such condition (except in any such case for any
such conditions that by their nature can be satisfied only on the Closing

State of California, in each case, in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with, the applicable provisions of the CCC. The Merger shall
become effective at the time the Agreement of Merger shall have been duly

incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, respectively (except that, in each case, the name of the
Surviving Company shall be "Abaxis, Inc."), and as so amended and restated
shall be the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company,
respectively, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. SECTION 1.06 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company.

(a) The board of directors of the Surviving Company effective as of, and
immediately following, the Effective Time shall consist of the members of the

and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Company.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company, to
hold office until their respective successors are duly appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company.

assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Company, its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub vested in or to be
vested in the Surviving Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and directors of
the Surviving Company shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of each such corporation or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective equityholders:

(a) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent-Owned Shares. Each share of
Company Common Stock (the "Shares") held in the treasury of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time and each Share owned by Parent or
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall
be made with respect thereto. All Shares issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are held by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company (each, a "Company Subsidiary") or by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub)
(collectively, "Converted Shares") will automatically be converted into such
number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock,
no par value per share, of the Surviving Company, or fraction thereof, such
that the ownership percentage of any such Subsidiary in the Surviving Company
immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership percentage
of such Subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time. (b) Shares of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, no par value per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the Surviving
Company.

(c) Company Common Stock. Each Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Shares to be cancelled
or converted pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or any Dissenting Shares) shall be
cancelled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive
$83.00 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). The Merger
Consideration shall be payable in accordance with Section 2.02(b).

(d) Company Equity Awards.

(i) Cash-Out Company RSU Awards. Each Company RSU Award that is outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that, by its terms as in effect
on the date hereof, would automatically vest upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such
Company RSU or any other Person, shall be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each Share subject to such Company RSU Award, less applicable withholding
obligations.

(ii) Rollover Company RSU Awards. Each Company RSU Award that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not subject to
Section 2.01(d)(i), by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder
of such Company RSU or any other Person, shall be cancelled and automatically
converted into a restricted stock unit award in respect of a number of Parent
Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which
award shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions
(including the same vesting terms) as were applicable to the corresponding
Company RSU Award.

(iii) Cash-Out Company PSU Awards. Each Company PSU Award that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that, by its terms as in
effect on the date hereof, would automatically vest upon the occurrence of the
Effective Time, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder of such
Company PSU or any other Person, shall be automatically cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of
each Share subject to such Company PSU Award, less applicable withholding
obligations. For purposes of such Company PSU Awards, the performance goals in
respect of performance periods that are incomplete as of the Effective Time
will be deemed to have been satisfied at the target level at the Effective
Time.

(iv) Rollover Company PSU Awards. Each Company PSU Award that is outstanding
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and that is not subject to Section 2.01(d)(iii), by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holder
of such Company PSU or any other Person, shall be cancelled and automatically
converted into a restricted stock unit award in respect of a number of Parent
Shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares subject to such Company PSU Award as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio, which
award shall be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the corresponding Company PSU Award. For purposes of such
Company PSU Awards, the performance goals in respect of performance periods
that are incomplete as of the Effective Time will be deemed to have been
satisfied at the target level at the Effective Time (and the converted awards
will be subject solely to service-based vesting following the Effective Time).

(e) Corporate Actions. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Company Board and the Compensation Committee of the Company Board, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.01(c) and (d). The Company
shall take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the Effective
Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Company will be required to deliver
Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or in
settlement of any Company RSU Award or Company PSU Award. All amounts payable
to holders of Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards pursuant to Sections
2.01(d)(i) and (iii) shall be paid through the payroll of Parent, the
Surviving Company or their Affiliates within fourteen (14) calendar days of
the Closing.

SECTION 2.02 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., or another nationally recognized financial
institution reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II (the
"Paying Agent") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II. At or
prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to pay
the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid at the Closing pursuant
to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Payment
Fund"). Funds made available to the Paying Agent shall be invested by the
Paying Agent, if and as directed by Parent, in short-term obligations of, or
short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the
United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of Shares pursuant
to this Section 2.02(a); provided, that no investment of such deposited funds
shall relieve Parent, the Surviving Company or the Paying Agent from promptly
making the payments required by this Section 2.02(a). Any interest or income
produced by such investments will be payable to Parent or the Surviving
Company, as Parent directs. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to this Section 2.02(a), except
as expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) Exchange Procedures. (i) Certificated Shares. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
(and in any event, no later than five (5) Business Days after the Closing
Date), Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a certificate representing Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (a "Certificate") whose Shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement: (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form, which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificate shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in
accordance with Section 2.02(e) to the Paying Agent) and shall otherwise be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
(B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificate in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) for
cancellation to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificate, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented
by such Certificate that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that was not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered; provided that it shall be a
condition precedent of payment that (x) such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any and all transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that such
Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Any holder of non-certificated Shares represented by
book-entry ("Book-Entry Shares") shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to
receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.01(c). In lieu thereof, each registered holder of one
(1) or more Book-Entry Shares shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive, and the Surviving Company shall cause the Paying Agent to
pay and deliver to such holder as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each Book-Entry Share that such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c). Payment of the
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered.

(iii) No interest shall be paid or accrue on any portion of the Merger
Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate (or affidavit of loss
in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 2.02(e)) or in respect of any Book-
Entry Share.

(c) Termination of Payment Fund. At any time following the first (1st)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) not disbursed to or claimed by holders of Shares, and thereafter such
holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Shares and in compliance with the procedures set forth in Section
2.02(b), without interest. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such holders at
such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property
of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company or its designee, free
and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Company or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Share for Merger Consideration
properly delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(d) Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, each of the Paying Agent, the Company, the Surviving Company
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, and pay such
withheld amounts over to the appropriate Governmental Authority. Any amounts
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made.

(e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit (in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Paying Agent) of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying
Agent or the Surviving Company, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration into which
the Shares formerly represented by such Certificate were converted pursuant to
Section 2.01(c); provided, however, that the Paying Agent may, in its
reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to provide a bond in a customary amount.

SECTION 2.03 Share Transfer Books. As of the Effective Time, the share
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be
no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company.
The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Section
2.03 shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for in
this Agreement or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Company for any reason, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

SECTION 2.04 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding Shares shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, reverse split, combination, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any
similar event shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided that this
sentence shall not be construed to permit the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries to take any action with respect to their securities that is
prohibited by this Agreement.

SECTION 2.05 Dissenting Shares.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of
record who did not vote in favor of the Company Shareholder Approval (or
consent thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand, and has properly
demanded, that the Company purchase such Shares (such Shares, the "Dissenting
Shares") for fair market value in accordance with, and in compliance in all
respects with, Chapter 13 of the CCC shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c), but
instead at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive
payment of the fair market value of such Shares as may be determined to be due
with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC. If
any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses the
right to payment of the fair market value of such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Chapter 13 of the CCC, or becomes ineligible for such payment, then the
right of such holder to receive such payment in respect of such Dissenting
Shares will cease and such Dissenting Shares will be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and will be exchangeable solely for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest or
duplication.

(b) The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the
Company for the purchase of Shares pursuant to Chapter 13 of the CCC, any
litigation related thereto, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the CCC and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair market value of Dissenting Shares (such
demands, withdrawals, instruments, or litigation related thereto, together,
"Shareholder Demands"). Parent shall have the right to participate in and
control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to, and the defense of,
such Shareholder Demands, and Parent shall give Company the right to review
and comment on all material filings or responses to be made in connection with
any such Shareholder Demands, and the right to consult on the settlement,
release, waiver or compromise of any such Shareholder Demands, and Parent
shall in good faith take such comments into account. The Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to,
or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any such Shareholder
Demand, or agree to any of the foregoing. Any portion of the aggregate Merger
Consideration made available to the Payment Agent to pay for Shares that have
become Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except (a) as disclosed in the SEC Reports filed or furnished by the Company
with the SEC after January 1, 2015 and prior to the date hereof (other than
disclosures in the "Risk Factors" sections of any such SEC Reports and any
disclosure of risks included in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer
contained in any such SEC Reports), or (b) as disclosed in the corresponding
section of the separate disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule")
(it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall also be deemed to be disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection
in this Agreement to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent
on its face), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger
Sub as follows:

SECTION 3.01 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.

(a) The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under
the Laws of the State of California and has the requisite power and authority
to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign legal entity to do business, and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction (to the extent a concept of "good standing" is applicable in
such jurisdiction) where the character of the properties or assets owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all the Company Subsidiaries, together with (i) the
jurisdiction and form of organization of each Company Subsidiary, (ii) the
authorized share capital or other equity interests of each Company Subsidiary
and (iii) the outstanding share capital or other equity interests of each
Company Subsidiary, and the holders thereof. Each Company Subsidiary is a
corporation or other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization (to the
extent a concept of "good standing" is applicable in such jurisdiction), and
has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case may be, power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected, individually
or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign legal entity
to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the
character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary (to the extent a
concept of "good standing" is applicable in such jurisdiction), except for
such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that would
not reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, owns any equity interest in any Person
other than the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) The Company has made available to Parent a true and complete copy of (i)
the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company, as amended
and as in effect on the date hereof (the "Company Articles"), (ii) the Amended
and Restated By-Laws of the Company, as in effect on the date hereof (the
"Company Bylaws") and (iii) the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary, each as in
effect as of the date hereof. Each such articles of incorporation and bylaws
(or equivalent organizational documents) is in full force and effect. The
Company is not in violation of any provisions of the Company Articles or the
Company Bylaws. None of the Company Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the
provisions of its articles of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents), in each case, except for violations that would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. SECTION 3.02 Capitalization.

(a) The authorized share capital of the Company consists of 35,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value

"Capitalization Date"), there were 22,870,967 shares of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding. No Company Subsidiary owns any capital stock of the Company. The
Company Common Stock constitutes the only outstanding class of securities of
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries registered under, or required to be

satisfied at one level per Company PSU Award) were issuable upon the
settlement of Company PSU Awards.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.02(a), as of the close of business on the
Capitalization Date, no shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or
other equity interests in, the Company are reserved for issuance or

the date of this Agreement, no Company RSU Awards or Company PSU Awards have
been issued or granted and no Shares have been issued. Except as set forth in
Section 3.02(a), there are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions or other
rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary any character relating to the issued or unissued Shares or other
equity interests or capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any such
Shares, capital stock or other equity interests, or any other rights or
instruments that are linked in any way to the price of the Shares or any
shares of capital stock or other equity interests of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary or the value of all or any part of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (collectively, including the shares of capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any Company
Subsidiary, "Equity Interests"), or obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, sell or grant any Equity Interests.

(c) There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other Indebtedness of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter
on which the Company Shareholders or the equityholders of any Company
Subsidiary may vote. There are no outstanding obligations under Contract or
otherwise of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Equity Interests, or to provide funds to or make any
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in any
Company Subsidiary or any other Person. None of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party to any shareholders' agreement, voting trust agreement
or registration rights agreement relating to any Equity Interests or any other
Contract relating to disposition, voting or dividends with respect to any
Equity Interests.

(d) All issued and outstanding Shares are duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable, and are not subject to and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive (or similar) right, purchase option, call or right
of first refusal or similar right. Each outstanding capital share, limited liability company interest, partnership interest or
equity or similar interest of each Company Subsidiary is duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and was issued free of preemptive
(or similar) rights. Each outstanding capital share, limited liability company
interest, partnership interest or equity or similar interest of each Company
Subsidiary that is owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary is owned
free and clear of all Liens.

(e) All Company RSU Awards and Company PSU Awards are evidenced by award
agreements in the forms that have been provided to Parent. Section 3.02(e) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a listing of all Persons (by
employee number) who hold outstanding Company RSU Awards and Company PSU
Awards as of the Capitalization Date, indicating, with respect to each Company
RSU Award or Company PSU Award, the number of Shares subject thereto, the date
of grant or issuance and the vesting schedule.

SECTION 3.03 Corporate Authority. The Company has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder, and subject to the receipt of the Company Shareholder
Approval, to consummate the Transactions. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions have been duly and validly authorized by all

enforceability (a) may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and (b) is subject to the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at Law or in equity).

Bylaws or the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all
consents, approvals and other authorizations described in Section 3.04(b) have
been obtained, that all filings and other actions described in Section 3.04(b)
have been made or taken and that the Company Shareholder Approval has been
obtained, conflict with or violate any federal, state, local or foreign law,

Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or by which any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except,
with respect to the foregoing clause (iii), for any such conflicts,
violations, breaches, defaults or other occurrences that would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the performance of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the Transactions will not, require any Consent from, notice to or
registration, declaration or filing with any federal, state, local or foreign

other Antitrust Laws as may be applicable to the Transactions, and (vi) such
other Consents, notices, registrations, declarations or filings the failure of
which to obtain would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.05 SEC Filings; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.

(a) The Company has filed or furnished (as applicable) on a timely basis all
forms, reports, statements, schedules and other documents required to be filed
or furnished (as applicable) by it with the SEC since January 1, 2015
(collectively, the "SEC Reports"), in each case as amended through the date
hereof. As of their respective dates, or, if amended prior to the date hereof,
as of the date of the last such amendment, the SEC Reports (i) were prepared
(and any SEC Reports filed after the date hereof will have been prepared), in
all material respects, in accordance with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Exchange
Act, and, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and
(ii) did not and will not, at the time they were or will be filed, or, if
amended prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. None of the Company Subsidiaries files, or is required to file,
periodic reports with the SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to the
SEC Reports. Since January 1, 2015, the Company has been and is in compliance
in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended, and the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the NASDAQ.

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements of the Company (including,
in each case, any notes thereto) contained in the SEC Reports (collectively,
the "Company Financial Statements") was prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods indicated and each fairly presents, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise
noted therein (except, in each case, as may be indicated in the notes thereto
or, in the case of interim financial statements, for normal non-material year-
end adjustments and for the absence of notes).

(c) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. To the Company's
Knowledge, since January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor the Company's
independent registered accountant has identified or been made aware of: (1)
any significant deficiency or material weakness in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting utilized by the Company that is
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information; or (2) any fraud, whether
or not material, that involves the management or other employees of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.

(d) The Company has designed and maintains a system of disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable each
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company to
make the certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has, or is subject to, any
material liability or obligation of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise), except for liabilities and obligations (i) that are
reflected, reserved against or otherwise provided for in the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company and the consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at
December 31, 2017 (including the notes thereto) included in the Company's
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31,
2017, (ii) that have been incurred since December 31, 2017 in the ordinary
course of business, (iii) arising out of this Agreement or in connection with
the Transactions, or (iv) that have been discharged or paid in full prior to
the date of this Agreement.

(f) As of the date hereof, other than as set forth in the Company Financial
Statements, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party
to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any "off balance sheet
arrangements" that would be required to be disclosed under Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.

SECTION 3.06 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. (a) From January 1, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, no event or
development has occurred that have had, or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Transactions, from January 1, 2018 through the date of this Agreement, (i)
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in
the ordinary course of business in all material respects and (ii) the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have not taken or failed to take any action that,
had such action been taken or failed to have been taken after the date hereof,
would (without Parent's consent) have constituted a breach of any of the
covenants set forth in Section 5.01(a) [Amendments], Section 5.01(b)
[Issuances], Section 5.01(d) [Dividends], Section 5.01(e) [Reclassifications],
Section 5.01(f) [Mergers], Section 5.01(h) [Indebtedness], Section 5.01(i)
[Loans], Section 5.01(l) [Benefits Matters], Section 5.01(m) [Settlements] or
Section 5.01(o) [Intellectual Property].

SECTION 3.07 Absence of Litigation. There is no litigation, suit, arbitration,
claim, charge, action or proceeding (each, an "Action") pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary nor any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is subject to any continuing Order of, or settlement agreement or
other similar written agreement with, any Governmental Authority, in each case
that would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

SECTION 3.08 Compliance with Laws; Permits.

(a) Since January 1, 2015, the Company and each Company Subsidiary have been
in compliance with all applicable Laws, except to the extent that the failure
to comply therewith would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to be material to the Company or such Company Subsidiary. Since
January 1, 2015, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has
received from any Governmental Authority any notices of violation with respect
to any Laws applicable to it, other than as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to be material to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary. To the Company's Knowledge, no investigation by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is pending, nor has any Governmental Authority indicated to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary an intention to conduct any such investigation, except for
such investigations the outcomes of which would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to be material to the Company or such
Company Subsidiary.

(b) Each of the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in possession of all
licenses, permits, approvals, accreditations, registrations, clearances,
certificates and other authorizations of any Governmental Authority necessary
for each such entity to own, lease and operate its assets and properties or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the "Company Permits"),
except where the failure to have, or the suspension or cancellation of, any of
the Company Permits would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
Permits is in full force and effect, and is not subject to any conditions
except for those conditions appearing on the face of such Company Permits, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
of, or the imposition of such conditions on, any Company Permits, would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. To the Company's Knowledge and except as would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, (i) there exist no facts or circumstances that make
it likely that any Company Permit will not be renewed or extended in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice on commercially
reasonable terms, (ii) no Governmental Authority has commenced, or given
written notice to the Company or any Company Subsidiary that it intends to
commence, a proceeding to revoke, or suspend, rescind, modify or not renew, or
to impose any materially adverse condition on, any Company Permit, (iii) all
reports and filings required to be filed with the relevant Governmental
Authority by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to any Company
Permit have been timely filed and are accurate and complete, (iv) all
regulatory fees, contributions or surcharges required to be paid by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Permit have
been timely paid and (v) since January 1, 2015, the Company and each Company
Subsidiary have been in compliance with the terms of all Company Permits.

(c) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (nor, to the
Company's Knowledge, any Company Representative): (i) has offered, authorized,
provided or given any payment or thing of value to any Person for the purpose
of influencing any act or decision of such Person to unlawfully obtain or
retain business or other advantage, (ii) has violated since January 1, 2015
any applicable Anti-Corruption Laws, (iii) has established or maintained, or
is maintaining, any unlawful fund of corporate monies or other properties, or
(iv) has taken any other action that would constitute an offer to pay, a
promise to pay or a payment of money or anything else of value, or an
authorization of such offer, promise or payment, directly or indirectly, to
any director, officer, employee, agent or representative of another company or
other entity in the course of their business dealings with the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, so as to unlawfully induce such Person to act
against the interest of his or her employer or principal.

(d) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries (nor, to the
Company's Knowledge, any Company Representative): (i) is, or is owned or
controlled by, a Person or entity subject to the sanctions administered by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
("OFAC") or included on the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked
Persons or Foreign Sanctions Evaders, Denied Persons List, Entities List,
Debarred Parties List, Excluded Parties List and Terrorism Exclusion List, or
any other lists of known or suspected terrorists, terrorist organizations or
other prohibited Persons made publicly available or provided to the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries by any Governmental Authority (such entities,
Persons or organizations collectively, the "Restricted Parties"); or (ii) has
conducted any business with or engaged in any transaction or arrangement with
or involving, directly or indirectly, any Restricted Parties or countries
subject to economic or trade sanctions imposed by any U.S. Governmental
Authority, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, in violation of
applicable Law, or has otherwise been in violation of any such sanctions,
restrictions or any similar Law. Except as, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have at all times since
January 1, 2015 been in compliance in all respects with all applicable Laws
relating to export controls, trade embargoes, and economic sanctions. To the
Company's Knowledge, neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries
is subject to any pending or threatened action of any Governmental Authority
that would restrict its ability to engage in export transactions, bar it from
exporting or otherwise limit in any material respect its exporting activities
or sales to any Governmental Authority. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received any written notice of material deficiencies
in connection with any export controls, trade embargoes or economic sanctions
matter from OFAC or any other Governmental Authority in its compliance efforts
nor made any voluntary disclosures to OFAC or any other Governmental Authority
of facts that could result in any material action being taken or any material
penalty being imposed by a Governmental Authority against the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries.

SECTION 3.09 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Section 3.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA), whether or not subject to ERISA, and all bonus, stock option, stock
purchase, restricted stock, cash- or equity-based incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, welfare, retirement,
severance, change-in-control or other compensatory or benefit plans, programs,
policies or arrangements, and all retention, bonus, employment, termination,
severance or other Contracts to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party, with respect to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has any current or future obligation, contingent or
otherwise, or that are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former
employee, officer, director or independent contractor of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (all such plans, programs, policies, or Contracts,
whether or not listed in Section 3.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
collectively, the "Company Benefit Plans").

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies
of the following (as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing each
Company Benefit Plan or, with respect to any such plan that is not in writing,
a written description of the material terms thereof, (ii) the annual report
(Form 5500) filed with the Internal Revenue Service for the last two (2) plan
years, (iii) the most recently received determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service relating to a Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recently
prepared actuarial report or financial statement relating to a Company Benefit
Plan, (v) the most recent summary plan description for such Company Benefit
Plan (or other descriptions of such Company Benefit Plan provided to
employees) and all modifications thereto, (vi) all material, non-routine
correspondence with the U.S. Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue
Service, (vii) all amendments, modifications or material supplements to any
Company Benefit Plan, and (viii) any related trust agreements, insurance
Contracts or documents of any other funding arrangements relating to a Company
Benefit Plan. Except as specifically provided in the foregoing documents made
available to Parent, there are no amendments to any Company Benefit Plans that
have been adopted or approved, nor has the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries undertaken to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any
new Company Benefit Plans.

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a filing
under any voluntary correction program of the Internal Revenue Service, the
U.S. Department of Labor or any other Governmental Authority with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
plan defect that would qualify for correction under any such program.

(d) All contributions required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any
Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date hereof, have been timely
made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on or
before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the books and records of
the Company.

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is in any part a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (i) materially complies
and, at all times after December 31, 2008 has materially complied, both in
form and operation, with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
final regulations and other applicable guidance thereunder and (ii) between
January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2008 was operated in good faith material
compliance with Section 409A of the Code, as determined under applicable
guidance of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. No compensation
payable by the Company or any Company Subsidiary has been reportable as
nonqualified deferred compensation in the gross income of any individual or
entity, and subject to an additional tax, as a result of the operation of
Section 409A of the Code. No assets set aside for the payment of benefits
under any "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" are held outside of the
United States, except to the extent that substantially all of the services to
which such benefits are attributable have been performed in the jurisdiction
in which such assets are held.

(f) Section 3.09(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each Company
Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
(the "Qualified Plans"). The Internal Revenue Service has issued a favorable
determination letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and the related trust
has not been revoked, and there are no existing circumstances, and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, no events have occurred that could reasonably be
expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any Qualified Plan or the
related trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan is intended to meet
the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(g) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412 or 4971 of the Code nor has the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates in the last six years maintained an employee
benefit plan subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA.

(h) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a plan that has two
or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer
Plan"); (ii) none of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) none of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
liability to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial
withdrawal from such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle
E of Title IV of ERISA.

(i) Neither the Company, nor any of the Company Subsidiaries, sponsors, has
sponsored or has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that
provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life
insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries
or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) will
result in, cause the vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in
the amount or value of, any payment, right or other benefit to any employee,
director or other service provider of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion
of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in
property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for
the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code,
or otherwise.

(k) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could result
in, any liability of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA,
(iii) under Sections 412, 430 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a
failure to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601

Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a preliminary Proxy
Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning itself and its Affiliates that is required to be included in the
Proxy Statement, and each of the Company and Parent covenants that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation in
the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with the SEC or first mailed
to the Company Shareholders or at the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any (written or oral) comments of the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement and to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly
as reasonably practicable. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Company
Shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date on which the
Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any (written or oral) comments from the SEC or its
staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements
to the Proxy Statement and shall provide Parent with a copy of all material
written correspondence between the Company or any Company Representatives, on
the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand (and a summary of
any oral conversations) with respect to the Proxy Statement or the
Transactions. The Company shall give Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement, including all
amendments and supplements thereto, prior to filing such documents with the
SEC and disseminating such documents to the Company Shareholders and
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on all responses to requests for
additional information and shall give due consideration, in good faith, to
including any comments on each such document or response that are reasonably
proposed by Parent. If, at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting,

of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the

under the Company's organizational documents and applicable Law) and shall
continue to comply with the "broker search" requirements of Rule 14a-13
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to any such new record date.

Company Bylaws and the rules of the NASDAQ to duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Shareholders Meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, (i) if (A) on a date for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies representing a
sufficient number of Shares to constitute a quorum and to obtain the Company
Shareholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, or (B) prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement that is required by applicable
Law is provided to the Company Shareholders within the minimum amount of time
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting required by applicable Law, the
Company shall, after consultation with Parent, have the right to, and (ii)
upon the written direction of Parent, if the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of Shares to constitute a quorum or the
Company has not received sufficient affirmative approvals from the Company
Shareholders to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval at the then-scheduled
date of the Company Shareholders Meeting, whether or not a quorum is present,
the Company shall, in either case, make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments of the Company Shareholders Meeting; provided that the Company
Shareholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than
thirty (30) calendar days after the date for which the Company Shareholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable Law). The Company shall, unless there has been a Change
of Company Recommendation, use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from the Company Shareholders proxies in favor of the Company Shareholder
Approval, and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to secure the
Company Shareholder Approval. The Company agrees to provide Parent with
periodic voting reports concerning the proxy solicitation results promptly
following any reasonable request by Parent.

(d) Except if the Company Board shall have made a Change of Company
Recommendation as permitted by Section 6.03, the Proxy Statement shall include
the Company Board Recommendation. The Company agrees that, except as set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence, its obligations pursuant to this
Section 6.01 shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company or the Company Shareholders
of any Competing Proposal; provided that the Company shall not be prohibited
from including in the Proxy Statement an accurate statement that a Competing
Proposal has been made and such statement shall not be deemed a Change of
Company Recommendation in and of itself. SECTION 6.02 Access to Information; Confidentiality. From the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of August 5, 2015 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between Zoetis Services LLC and the
Company, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to: (a)
provide to Parent and Merger Sub and their respective representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours in such a manner as not to
interfere with the operation of any business conducted by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, upon prior written notice to the Company, to the officers,
employees, properties, offices and other facilities of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and to the books and records (and any Tax Returns and Tax
records) thereof; and (b) furnish promptly such information concerning the
business, properties, Contracts, Taxes, assets and liabilities of the Company
and Company Subsidiaries as Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
representatives may reasonably request; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be required to (or to cause any Company Subsidiary to) afford such
access or furnish such information to the extent that the Company believes, in
good faith, that doing so would: (i) result in the loss of attorney-client
privilege (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not result in a loss
of attorney-client privilege); or (ii) breach, contravene or violate any
applicable Law (provided that the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in such a breach, contravention or violation). All information provided
or furnished pursuant to this Section 6.02 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall
not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract
with any Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement, and none of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is party to any Contract, in each case, that
prohibits or restricts compliance with this Section 6.02.

SECTION 6.03 No Solicitation.

(a) Except as permitted in this Section 6.03, (i) from and after the date of
this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and the Company Representatives to, immediately cease any solicitations,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to any Competing Proposal and to request to have destroyed or returned to the
Company any confidential information that has been provided to any Person in
connection with any Competing Proposal and will enforce and, except as
otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, will not waive any provisions of, any
confidentiality or standstill agreement (or any similar agreement) to which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party relating to any such
Competing Proposal and (ii) during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall
not, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the Company Representative not
to, directly or indirectly, (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiry, proposal,
indication of interest or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, the submission of any Competing Proposal, (B) furnish any
information regarding the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any third party
in connection with or in response to a Competing Proposal, except to notify
such third party of the restrictions of this Section 6.03, (C) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate, or participate in any discussions
or negotiations with, knowingly encourage or facilitate in any way any effort
by, any third party with respect to any Competing Proposal, (D) approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, a Competing Proposal or (E)
agree to do any of the foregoing. The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the
date of this Agreement, and none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
party to any Contract, in each case, that prohibits or restricts compliance
with this Section 6.03.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if,
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, the Company receives a written Competing
Proposal from a Person that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.03
and that the Company Board believes in good faith to be bona fide, the Company
and its Representatives may contact such Person solely to clarify any textual
ambiguity contained in the written Competing Proposal (and not to engage in
any discussion or negotiation of such Competing Proposal), and if (i) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that such Competing Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take the actions
referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this sentence would be reasonably
expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company
Shareholders under applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the
Person making such Competing Proposal and its representatives and (B)
participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such
Competing Proposal and its representatives regarding such Competing Proposal;
provided, however, that (x) the Company shall not, and shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives not to, disclose any material
nonpublic information regarding the Company to such Person without first
entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person; (y)
the Company will keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), of the material terms and
conditions of any Competing Proposal that it receives and of any material
amendments or material developments with respect to such Competing Proposal
(including any material changes thereto and including by providing copies of
any Acquisition Agreement or revised or new Acquisition Agreement and any
other relevant transaction documents); and (z) will substantially
contemporaneously provide to Parent copies of any material information
concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or made available
by the Company to such other Person (or its representatives) that was not
previously provided or made available to Parent.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 6.03(d) or Section 6.03(e), neither the
Company nor the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) adopt,
authorize, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, authorize,
approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal, (ii) withhold, withdraw, modify,
qualify or amend, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, modify, qualify
or amend, in each case in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board
Recommendation or fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (iii) make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation
against such offer or a temporary "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (iv) fail to
publicly recommend against any Competing Proposal, or fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within ten (10)
Business Days after the written request of Parent following a Competing
Proposal that has been publicly announced or publicly disclosed (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting), (v) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) or (v), a "Change of Company Recommendation"), or (vi) allow the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, term
sheet, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement relating to, or that is
intended to result in, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) (each
an "Acquisition Agreement") or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Transactions.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may (x) in response to a Competing Proposal, (1) make a Change of
Company Recommendation or (2) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(h) or (y) in response to an Intervening Event,
make a Change of Company Recommendation, if:

(i) either (A) a Competing Proposal that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.03 is made to the Company by a third party and such Competing
Proposal is not withdrawn, or (B) an Intervening Event has occurred and is
continuing;

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that (x) in the case of a
Competing Proposal, such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal,
and the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation or terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(h), as applicable, in response to
such Superior Proposal would be reasonably expected to result in a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable Law or (y)
in the case of an Intervening Event, that the failure to make a Change of
Company Recommendation in response to such Intervening Event would be
reasonably expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Shareholders under applicable Law;

(iii) the Company provides Parent at least four (4) Business Days' prior
written notice (which notice itself shall not constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation) of the Company's intention to make a Change of Company
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(h),
as applicable (a "Notice of Change of Recommendation"), which notice shall (x)
state expressly that it has received a Superior Proposal or that an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing, (y) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, identify the Person making such Superior Proposal and
include the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and the
Company shall contemporaneously provide a copy of any relevant Acquisition
Agreement and any other relevant transaction documents to Parent for such
Competing Proposal), or, in the case of an Intervening Event, the material
facts and circumstances of such Intervening Event and (z) state expressly that
the Company Board intends to make a Change of Company Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(h), as applicable,
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor;

(iv) if requested by Parent in writing, the Company has negotiated in good
faith with Parent with respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent for at least four (4) Business Days following receipt by Parent of such
Notice of Change of Recommendation (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal or any material
development relating to such Intervening Event shall require a new Notice of
Change of Recommendation and an additional three (3) Business Days' period
from the date of such notice);

(v) taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by
Parent, the Company Board has determined, in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel), that (x) in the case
of a Competing Proposal, such Competing Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in writing by Parent were to be
given effect and (y) the failure to make a Change of Company Recommendation or
terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01(h), as applicable,
would be reasonably expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the Company Shareholders under applicable Law; and

(vi) the Company shall have complied with this Section 6.03 with respect to
such Competing Proposal or Intervening Event.

(e) Notwithstanding any Change of Company Recommendation, unless this
Agreement is validly terminated (including pursuant to Section 8.01(h)), (x)
this Agreement, the Merger and the principal terms thereof shall be submitted
by the Company to the Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligation and
(y) the Company and the Company Board shall not submit to the Company
Shareholders any Competing Proposal or propose to do so.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.03 shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) disclosing to the Company Shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any disclosure to the
Company Shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to make such disclosure would be reasonably expected to result in a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Shareholders under applicable
Law (for the avoidance of doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by the
Company or the Company Board of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act, shall not constitute a Change of Company
Recommendation); provided, however, that in any event, the Company Board shall
not make a Change of Company Recommendation or terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(h), except in accordance with Section 6.03(d).

(g) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.03 by any
Company Subsidiary or Company Representative shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Section 6.03 by the Company.

SECTION 6.04 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
the limitations set forth in Section 6.04(d), each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law to cause the conditions to each party's obligation to
consummate the Transactions as set forth in Article VII to be satisfied and to
consummate and make effective the Transactions as promptly as practicable (but
in no event later than the Outside Date), including (i) preparing and filing
all documentation to effect all necessary applications, notifications and
filings and to obtain as promptly as practicable all clearances,
authorizations, Consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits, and waivers of
all Governmental Authorities or other Persons necessary or advisable in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, (ii) cooperating fully
with the other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such clearances,
authorizations, Consents, Orders, approvals, licenses, permits and waivers,
(iii) promptly providing any other information to any Governmental Authority
as such Governmental Authority may lawfully request in connection herewith,
and (iv) obtaining all Consents from Governmental Authorities required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) as promptly as
practicable.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the
Company shall promptly make all filings that may be required for the
satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) by each of them in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions, which, in any event,
shall be made within 15 Business Days following the date of this Agreement
with respect to the initial filings required under the HSR Act and as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement with respect to the required
Consents from Governmental Authorities set forth on Section 7.01(c) of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule. Each party shall furnish to the other party or its
outside counsel such necessary information and assistance as the other party
may reasonably request in connection with the preparation of any necessary
filings or submissions by it to any Governmental Authority. If either party
receives a request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to promptly make,
or cause to be made, an appropriate response in compliance with such request.

(c) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in all respects and consult with
each other in connection with any application, notification, filing or
submission, or any review, investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental
Authority, relating to the Transactions, including by allowing the other party
to review in advance all proposed communications with and submissions to, any
Governmental Authority relating to the Transactions, consulting with the other
party in advance of any meeting, telephone call or conference with, any
Governmental Authority, and, to the extent permitted, giving the other party
or its counsel the opportunity to attend and participate in any in-person
meetings, telephone calls or conferences with any Governmental Authority. Each
of Parent and the Company shall keep the other party apprised of the content
and status of any communications with or from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the Transactions, including promptly notifying the other party
hereto of any communications with any Governmental Authority relating to the
Transactions and promptly providing to the other party copies of any written
communications with any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions; provided that materials required to be provided pursuant to this
Section 6.04(c) may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the Company or other bidders for the Company, (ii) as necessary
to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
attorney-client or other privilege concerns. Any disclosures or provision of
copies by one party to the other pursuant to this Section 6.04(c) may be
restricted to outside counsel. (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent shall
not be required to offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, (i) the sale, divestiture or other
disposition of any assets, rights, products or businesses of Parent, the
Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries; or (ii) any other
restrictions on the activities of Parent, the Company, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, except as set forth on Section 6.04(d) of the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, if and to the extent necessary to obtain any Consents
from Governmental Authorities required for the satisfaction of the condition
set forth in Section 7.01(c) pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust
Laws applicable to the Transactions. Unless requested in writing by Parent,
the Company shall not offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or other
disposition of any assets, rights, products or businesses of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any other restrictions on the activities
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.

(e) Parent shall not enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect
any transaction, including any merger or acquisition, that would reasonably be
expected to make it materially more difficult, or to materially increase the
time required, to obtain any Consents from Governmental Authorities required
for the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) pursuant to
the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions.

SECTION 6.05 Employee Matters.

(a) From the Closing Date through the first anniversary thereof (the
"Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each
individual who is actively employed by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
on the Closing Date and continues to be actively employed after the Effective
Time (each, a "Covered Employee") (i) at least the same level of base salary
and target cash bonus opportunity, in the aggregate, as were provided to the
Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood
that Parent or its Affiliates may adjust the level of base salary or target
cash bonus opportunity provided that the sum of such amounts is no less than
was provided to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time), and (ii) other compensation and employee benefits that are
substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the compensation and employee
benefits provided to similarly situated employees of Parent.

(b) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in
an employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company or the Company Subsidiaries), Parent shall cause such
employee benefit plan to recognize the service of such Covered Employee with
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility,
participation, level of benefits, and vesting under such employee benefit plan
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a corresponding
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such
recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, (ii) apply for
any purpose under any retiree medical plan or defined benefit pension plan or
(iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any health care
plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate for the
plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause any preexisting
condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such Parent or
Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the
extent that such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) recognize any health care expenses
incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date
(or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-
pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.07, the provisions of this
Section 6.05 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, director or other service provider, or any
other individual associated therewith, shall be regarded for any purpose as a
third-party beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan
or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any
other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored
by Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or
limit the ability of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date;
or (iii) confer upon any current or former employee, officer, director or
consultant any right to employment or continued employment or continued
service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the
Closing Date, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), or constitute or
create an employment agreement with any employee.

SECTION 6.06 Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Parent hereby guarantees
the due, prompt and faithful payment, performance and discharge by Merger Sub
of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of the covenants, agreements,
obligations and undertakings of Merger Sub under this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, and covenants and agrees to take all actions
necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and discharge by
Merger Sub hereunder.

SECTION 6.07 Public Announcements. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and give each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to this Agreement and the other Transactions
and shall not issue any such press release or make any public announcement
prior to such consultation and review, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system;
provided that, subject to Section 6.03 in the case of the Company, each party
hereto may make statements that are not materially inconsistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by Parent, Merger
Sub or the Company in compliance with this Section 6.07. The initial press
release of the parties announcing the execution of this Agreement shall be a
joint press release of Parent and the Company in a form that is mutually agreed.

SECTION 6.08 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification. From and after the Effective Time, the Company and the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors and officers of the Company and each Company Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Covered Persons") to the same extent such Persons are
indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Articles, the Company
Bylaws and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary in existence on the date
of this Agreement arising out of acts or omissions in their capacity as
directors or officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Company shall advance expenses
(including reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses)
incurred in the defense of any Action or investigation with respect to the
matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.09(a) in
accordance with the rights of each Covered Person as provided in the Company
Articles, the Company Bylaws and the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary in existence
on the date of this Agreement.

(b) Insurance. The Company shall be permitted to, prior to the Effective Time
and in consultation with Parent as provided in this Section 6.09(b), obtain
and fully pay the premium for an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Insurance")
that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate to the intended beneficiaries thereof than the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy; provided, however, that
the Company shall, in cooperation with Parent, use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the most favorable pricing and most comprehensive coverage
reasonably available for such policy and in no event shall Parent, the Company
or the Surviving Company be required to expend for such policy an amount in
excess of six (6) times the annual aggregate premium currently paid by the
Company for such insurance (the "Maximum Premium"). If the Company and the
Surviving Company for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policy
as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Company to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at
least six (6)-years from and after the Effective Time (and for so long
thereafter as any claims brought prior to the end of such six (6)-year period
thereunder are being adjudicated) the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of
the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall
cause the Surviving Company to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period (and for so long thereafter as any claims brought prior to the
end of such six (6)-year period thereunder are being adjudicated) with terms,
conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable
as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of this
Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Company be required to expend an annual aggregate premium for
such insurance in excess of 250% times the Maximum Premium.

(c) Successors. If the Surviving Company, Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, require such successors,
assigns or transferees of the Surviving Company or Parent to assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.08.

(d) Continuation. For not less than six (6) years from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall ensure that the Company Articles and Company Bylaws shall
contain, and shall cause the Surviving Company to ensure that the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company and the articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or other similar documents) of each Company
Subsidiary shall contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses for periods at or
prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary, as
applicable. The contractual indemnification rights, if any, in existence on
the date of this Agreement with any of the directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be assumed by the Surviving
Company, without any further action, and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms following the Effective Time.

(e) Benefit. The provisions of this Section 6.08 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Covered Party, each Covered
Party's heirs, executors or administrators and each Covered Party's
representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the
Company and the Surviving Company and shall not be amended in a manner that is
adverse to any Covered Parties (including their successors, assigns and heirs)
without the consent of the Covered Party (including the successors, assigns
and heirs) affected thereby.

(f) Non-Exclusivity. The provisions of this Section 6.08 are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. Nothing
in this Agreement, including this Section 6.08, is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Covered
Parties, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for
in this Section 6.08 is not prior to, or in substitution for, any such claims
under any such policies.

SECTION 6.09 Shareholder Litigation. The Company shall promptly notify Parent
of any Action brought by the Company Shareholders or other Persons against the
Company or any of its directors, officers or the Company Representatives
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (such Action,
a "Shareholder Action"), and shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly
informed with respect to the status thereof. Without limiting the preceding
sentence, the Company shall give Parent the right to participate in the
defense or settlement of any Shareholder Action and/or review and comment on
all material filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with
any such Shareholder Action, and the right to consult on any settlement with
respect to such Shareholder Action, and the Company will in good faith take
such comments into account, and no such settlement shall be offered or agreed
to without Parent's prior written consent.

SECTION 6.10 Takeover Laws. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested shareholder" or other anti-takeover Law or any
comparable anti-takeover provisions of the Company Articles, the Company
Bylaws or the articles of incorporation and bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) of any Company Subsidiary or any shareholder rights
plan or similar agreement becomes or is deemed to be applicable to this
Agreement or the Transactions, then the Company Board and/or board of
directors (or equivalent body) of such Company Subsidiary, as applicable,
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the
Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Law or Laws or other
comparable anti-takeover provisions, "rights plan," "rights agreement" or
"poison pill" inapplicable to the foregoing.

SECTION 6.11 Section 16 Matters. The Company shall be permitted to take such
actions to the extent as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to ensure
that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) by any officer or director of the Company who is
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act pursuant to the Transactions are
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 6.12 Deregistration; Delisting. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will cooperate with Parent and use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part pursuant to
applicable Law to cause (a) the delisting of the Shares from the NASDAQ as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time; and (b) the deregistration
of the Shares pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
such delisting.

SECTION 6.13 Notification. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will
give prompt notice to Parent of any failure or reasonably expected failure by
the Company to comply with or satisfy in any respect any representation,
warranty, covenant, condition, obligation or other agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, if and only
to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub to consummate the Merger set forth in Article VII to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing. No such notification will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the parties under this
Agreement.

SECTION 8.01 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, in the case of
clauses (a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) below, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or,
in the case of clauses (d) and (e) below, at any time before receipt of the
Company Shareholder Approval, as follows (the date of any such termination,
the "Termination Date"):

(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before November 15, 2018; provided that if the Effective Time
shall not have occurred by such date and the conditions set forth in Section
7.01(b) (but solely if the applicable Law or Order relates to an Antitrust
Law) and/or Section 7.01(c) shall not have been satisfied by such date, and
the conditions set forth in Section 7.01(b) (but solely if the applicable Law

jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
decision, injunction, decree, ruling, Law or Order permanently enjoining or

(including any postponement or adjournment thereof), the Company Shareholder
Approval is not obtained;

Company Recommendation;

(f) by Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform or comply with its
representations, warranties, agreements, covenants or obligations contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.02(a), Section 7.02(b) or
Section 7.02(c) and (ii) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30)
days after Parent's giving of written notice to the Company of such breach or, if earlier, by the Outside Date;

(g) by the Company, if Parent breaches or fails to perform or comply with its

failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or Section 7.03(b) and
(ii) cannot be or has not been cured within thirty (30) days after the
Company's giving of written notice to Parent of such breach or, if earlier, by

receives the Company Shareholder Approval, in order to accept a Superior
Proposal and enter into a definitive agreement providing for the consummation

Agreement and remain in full force and effect, in accordance with their
respective terms and conditions, (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive the termination of this Agreement, in accordance with its terms and
conditions and (c) nothing herein will relieve (x) any party from any

termination (in the case of a termination by Parent).

(d) If (i) any Person makes a Competing Proposal (substituting "50%" for each

publicly withdrawn at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date of the
Company Shareholders Meeting, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(b), Section 8.01(d), or Section 8.01(f)
and (iii) within 12 months of such termination, the Company consummates or

prior to the termination hereof), then the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee) the Company Termination Fee in immediately available funds prior to

to an Antitrust Law); (B) prior to such termination, Parent had exercised its

Company (or its designee) $120,000,000 (the "Parent Tier II Termination Fee")

of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Affiliates (collectively, "Parent Related Parties") or any
other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the right of Parent to seek
specific performance in accordance with Section 9.08, except as set forth in

SECTION 9.03 Certain Definitions. As used in this Agreement, certain
capitalized terms shall have the meanings set forth in Annex A attached
hereto.

SECTION 9.04 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision

sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 9.07 Parties in Interest. Other than the provisions of Section 6.08
(which is for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced
by such Persons in accordance with the terms thereof), this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing
in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. SECTION 9.08 Remedies; Specific Performance. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed, or were threatened to be not performed, in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each party further agrees that
no other party or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.08, and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing

proceeding seeking equitable relief pursuant to this Section 9.08, the Outside

resolved.

SECTION 9.09 Governing Law.

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether arising in

relate to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that
would result in the application of any Law other than the Law of the State of
Delaware; provided that the Merger (to the extent required by the Laws of the
State of California to be governed thereby) and matters relating to the
conduct of directors of the Company shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of California, without giving effect to
conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the Law
of any other jurisdiction.

(b) The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding seeking to
enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions (whether brought by any
party or any of its Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates)
shall be heard and determined exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal
court of the United States located within the State of Delaware. Consistent
with the preceding sentence, each of the parties hereto hereby (i) submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court sitting in the State
of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by either party hereto, (ii) agrees that service of process
will be validly effected by sending notice in accordance with Section 9.02 and
(iii) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, defense,
or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally
to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that the Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above
named courts. With respect to any particular suit or other Action, venue shall
lie solely in the Court of Chancery of the state of Delaware or such federal
court located within the State of Delaware. The parties further agree, to the
extent permitted by Law, that final and nonappealable judgment against a party
in any Action contemplated above shall be conclusive and may be enforced in
any other jurisdiction within or outside the United States by suit on the
judgment, a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and amount of such judgment.

SECTION 9.10 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto by
action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards of directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided that, after receipt of the Company
Shareholder Approval, no amendment may be made that would require the approval
of the Company Shareholders under applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of NASDAQ, without obtaining such approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the parties
hereto.

SECTION 9.11 Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto
may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of
any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party contained herein or in any document delivered

under applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of NASDAQ requires
further approval by the Company Shareholders, without obtaining such approval.
Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any
party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of those rights.

SECTION 9.12 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING

OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR
ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH
OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12.

(including by facsimile transmission or other means of electronic
transmission, such as by electronic mail in ".pdf," ".tif," ".jpeg" or similar
form) ("Electronic Delivery") in two or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Any such counterpart, to the extent
delivered using Electronic Delivery shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original executed counterpart and shall be considered to have
the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. No party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic
Delivery to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or
instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic
Delivery as a defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party
forever waives any such defense, except to the extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

SECTION 9.14 Interpretation and Rules of Construction. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section, such reference
shall be to an Exhibit, an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. The table of contents, index of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall
not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
Documents, materials and information are deemed to have been "made available"
to Parent and Merger Sub, only if such documents, materials or information
were available for review by the Company or the Company Representatives
through an electronic data room in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or disclosed in a SEC Report filed and publicly available,
in each case, prior to the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not
exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of
such gender or number as the circumstances require. Any agreement, instrument
or Law defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or Law
as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, unless otherwise
specifically indicated. References to a Person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. When calculating the period of time prior to which, within
which or following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating such period
shall be excluded, and if the last day of such period is not a Business Day,
the period shall end on the immediately following Business Day. Unless
otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be
deemed references to the lawful money of the United States of America. Each of
the parties has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement must be construed as if it is drafted by all the parties, and
no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.
References to "days" shall mean "calendar days" unless expressly stated
otherwise. When "since" is used in connection with a date, the period covered
thereby shall be inclusive of such date. No specific provision, representation
or warranty shall limit the applicability of a more general provision,
representation or warranty. It is the intent of the parties that each
representation, warranty, covenant, condition, obligation and agreement
contained in this Agreement shall be given full, separate, and independent
effect and that such provisions are cumulative.
