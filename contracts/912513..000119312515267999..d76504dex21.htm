11 ARTICLE 2

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01 _The Merger_. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the
"Surviving Corporation").

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall take place in New York City at the offices of Davis
Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 as soon
as possible, but in any event no later than at 9:00 a.m. (Eastern time)
on the fourth Business Day after the date the conditions set forth in Article
9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver
of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent
permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of such
conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to herein as the "Closing Date".

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger.
The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of
the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 

 __Section 2.02 _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time: __

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c), Section
2.04, or Section 2.05, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive from
Parent $75.25 in cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of
the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.03, without interest.

 



12 (b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, the outstanding shares of Company Stock held in the rabbi trust
pursuant to the Companys Supplemental Savings Plan, which shall be converted
into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(a)).

(c) Each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such
number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each
such Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation common
stock immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of
Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and, except as provided in Section
2.02(c), shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.03 _Surrender and Payment_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint, with the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), an agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the
purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing shares of Company Stock (the "Certificates") or
(ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). At
or prior to the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent an amount in cash in immediately available funds (the
"Exchange Fund") equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares, excluding (i)
shares of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such shares in
accordance with Delaware Law (each such share, a "Dissenting Share") and (ii)
shares held by the Company and by Parent. If a holder of Dissenting Shares
fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal pursuant
to Section 262 of the Delaware Law with respect to any Dissenting Shares, (i)
such shares of Company Stock shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and (ii)
Parent shall make available or cause to be made available to the Exchange
Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of
Dissenting Shares for which the holder thereof has failed to perfect,

 



13 _ _ withdrawn or otherwise lost the right to appraisal pursuant to Section
262 of the Delaware Law and (y) the Merger Consideration. The Exchange Agent
shall invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Financial Services LLC,
respectively, or in money market funds having a rating in the highest
investment category granted by a recognized credit rating agency at the time
of investment. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
aggregate amounts payable under Section 2.02(a) shall be returned to the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 2.03(g). To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or the Exchange
Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent
to make prompt cash payment under Section 2.02(a), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the cash in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make such payments
under Section 2.02(a). __

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within five Business
Days), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.08) or surrender of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent, which
letter of transmittal shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree) for use in such
exchange. If any Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Section 2.04, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent
promptly (and in any event within five Business Days) after the date on which
such Dissenting Shares cease to be Dissenting Shares to mail to the record
holder of such shares of Company Stock the letter of transmittal and
instructions referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect
to such shares of Company Stock.

(c) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of surrender as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, in exchange therefor a cash amount by check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such
holder (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 2.07) equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company Stock represented by
such

 



14  Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.08) or book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares and (y) the Merger
Consideration. Upon such surrender or transfer, as the case may be, each such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon such surrender or transfer,
as the case may be. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be,
each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after the
Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

 

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be
properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to
the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Exchange Agent and the Depository Trust Company
("DTC") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(Eastern time) on the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC
or its nominee on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (such amount, the "DTC Payment") and
(ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing
Date, the Exchange Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the DTC Payment.

 

(f) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

(g) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Stock entitled thereto six months after the Effective Time
shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the
Merger

 



15  Consideration in respect of such shares without any interest thereon, upon
(i) surrender to the Surviving Corporation of a Certificate, together, if
requested by the Surviving Corporation, with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Surviving
Corporation (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock two
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, immediately prior to
such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

Section 2.04 _Dissenting Shares_ _._ Notwithstanding Section 2.02, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and a holder thereof shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by Section 262 of the Delaware Law with respect to such
Dissenting Shares, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses the right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal,
such shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands received by the Company
for appraisal of shares. Except with the prior written consent of Parent or
as otherwise required by Applicable Law, the Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.05 _Employee Equity._

 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option, whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall
become a right to receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time
(but in no event later than five Business Days thereafter), an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, by (y)
the excess, if any, of the amount of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per share of the Company Stock Option (with the aggregate
payment rounded down to the nearest cent), less applicable Tax withholding.
For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Stock Option with an exercise price
that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be canceled
without any consideration to the holder thereof.

 



16 (b) At the Effective Time, each Company SAR, whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, be cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive,
as soon as practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
five Business Days thereafter), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Stock
subject to the Company SAR, by (y) the excess, if any, of the amount of the
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of the Company SAR
(with the aggregate payment rounded down to the nearest cent), less applicable
Tax withholding. For the avoidance of doubt, each Company SAR with an
exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall
be canceled without any consideration to the holder thereof.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, each vested Company RSU (including any Company RSUs
that will vest as of the Effective Time) that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each, a "Vested RSU"), shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled
and converted into and shall become a right to receive, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business
Days thereafter), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
the Vested RSU, by (y) the amount of the Merger Consideration, less applicable
Tax withholding; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect to any Vested RSUs that
constitute nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the
Code and that are not permitted to be paid at the Effective Time without
triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such payment shall
be made at the earliest time permitted under the Company Stock Plan and
applicable award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code.

(d) At the Effective Time, each unvested Company RSU (each, an "Unvested
RSU") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and will not
vest as of the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be cancelled and converted into and
shall become a right to receive an amount in cash (each, a "Deferred RSU
Payment"), without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Unvested RSU, by (y) the
amount of the Merger Consideration. Each Deferred RSU Payment (or applicable
portion thereof) shall be paid (less applicable Tax withholding) on the
applicable vesting dates specified under the Company Stock Plan and the
agreements evidencing the related Unvested RSU, and shall be subject to the
same forfeiture, termination of employment and acceleration of vesting
provisions that would have applied had such Unvested RSUs remained
outstanding in accordance with their terms.

 



17 (e) At the Effective Time, each Company Deferred Stock Right, shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
cancelled and converted into and shall become a right to receive, as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (but in no event later than five Business
Days thereafter), an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to
the Company Deferred Stock Right, by (y) the amount of the Merger
Consideration, less applicable Tax withholding (such amount, the "Company
Deferred Stock Right Payment"); _provided_ , _that_ , the Company Deferred
Stock Right Payments made with respect to any Company Deferred Stock Rights
that are set forth on Section 2.05(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(which, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute nonqualified deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and that are not permitted to
be paid at the Effective Time without triggering a Tax or penalty under
Section 409A of the Code), shall be paid at the earliest time permitted under
the Company Stock Plan and applicable deferral election form that will not
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code and; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Company Deferred Stock Right Payments shall be deemed
invested, at the holders direction, in one or more of the hypothetical
investment options as specified on Appendix A of the Companys Supplemental
Savings Plan, it being understood that the Company Deferred Stock Right
Payment shall be credited or debited, as applicable, to reflect amounts of
hypothetical income and appreciation and depreciation pursuant to such
hypothetical investment as of the hypothetical investment date and through the
date such amount is paid in accordance with this Section 2.05(e).

 

(f) At the Effective Time, all restrictions imposed on each vested share of
Company Restricted Stock (including any shares of Company Restricted Stock
that will vest as of the Effective Time) that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (collectively, the "Vested Restricted Stock") shall
lapse. At the Effective Time, the Vested Restricted Stock shall be treated in
the same manner as Company Stock (other than Company Restricted Stock)
pursuant to Section 2.02(a) hereof.

 

(g) At the Effective Time, each unvested share of Company Restricted Stock
(collectively, the "Unvested Restricted Stock") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and will not vest as of the Effective
Time shall be cancelled and converted into, and shall become, a right to
receive an amount in cash (each, a "Deferred Restricted Stock Payment"),
without interest, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of shares of Company Stock subject to the Unvested Restricted Stock by (y) the
amount of the Merger Consideration. Each Deferred Restricted Stock Payment
(or applicable portion thereof) shall be paid (less applicable Tax
withholdings) on the applicable vesting dates specified under the Company
Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing the related Unvested
Restricted Stock, and shall be subject to the same forfeiture, termination of
employment and acceleration of vesting provisions that would have applied had
such Unvested Restricted Stock remained outstanding in accordance with its
terms.

 



18 (h) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company or the compensation committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which
are reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.05,
including, without limitation, establishing procedures in consultation with
Parent pursuant to which holders of Company Deferred Stock Rights may elect
hypothetical investment options pursuant to Section 2.05(e).

 

(i) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the holders of the former Unvested RSUs, Unvested Restricted Stock and
Company Deferred Stock Rights appropriate notices setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plan and agreements evidencing the grants
thereunder, and stating that such Unvested RSUs, Company Deferred Stock Rights
and Unvested Restricted Stock have been converted into the right to receive
Deferred RSU Payments, Company Deferred Stock Right Payments and Deferred
Restricted Stock Payments, as applicable, and that the right to such payments
shall be subject to the same forfeiture, termination of employment and
acceleration of vesting provisions that would have applied had the related
award of Unvested RSUs, Company Deferred Stock Rights or Unvested Restricted
Stock, as applicable, remained outstanding in accordance with its terms.

Section 2.06 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date
during such period, but excluding any change that results from any issuance of
shares of Company Stock permitted pursuant to Section 6.01 and any exercise of
Company Stock Options or Company SARs or any settlement of Company RSUs or
Company Deferred Stock Rights outstanding as of the date hereof, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to eliminate the effect of such event on the
Merger Consideration or any such other amounts payable pursuant to this
Agreement.

Section 2.07 _Withholding Rights_ _._  Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.
If the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, so withholds amounts, and provided that such amounts withheld are
remitted to the

 



19  appropriate Taxing Authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding.

Section 2.08 _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

 

ARTICLE 3

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

Section 3.01 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time,

Effect. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the concept of good
standing is recognized and where such qualification is necessary, except for

any of the Companys capital stock necessary in connection with the
consummation of the Merger (the "Company Stockholder Approval"). Assuming

enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Applicable Laws affecting creditors rights generally

contemplated hereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Companys
stockholders, (ii) unanimously declared advisable this Agreement and the

filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with the
Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,

transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict

provision of any Material Contract binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any
asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in

will provide Parent with a schedule that sets forth, for each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,

schedule described in the immediately preceding sentence, updated as of ten
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) With respect to any Employee Plan covered by Subtitle B, Part 4 of Title I
of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, no non-exempt prohibited transaction
has occurred that has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to incur any material liability under ERISA
or the Code. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is expected to incur
any liability under Title IV of ERISA with respect to any ongoing, frozen or
terminated "single-employer plan", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15)
of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them or any ERISA
Affiliate. With respect to any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA) contributed to, or previously contributed to, by the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate, neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred any material withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA that
remains unsatisfied or expects to incur any such liability, except as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(d) Each Employee Plan, and any award thereunder, that is or forms part of a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
or 457A of the Code is in documentary compliance with, and has been operated
and administered in all material respects in compliance with, Section 409A or
457A of the Code, as applicable, and the guidance issued by the IRS
thereunder. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation
to gross-up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any current or former Service
Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service Provider, including
under Section 409A, 457A or 4999 of the Code.

(e) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending or
has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the IRS, and, to the knowledge of the Company, no circumstances exist
that would reasonably be expected to result in any such determination letter
being revoked or not being reissued or a penalty under the IRS Closing
Agreement Program if discovered during an IRS audit or

 



34  investigation. Each trust created under any such Employee Plan is exempt
from Tax under Section 501(a) of the Code and has been so exempt since its
creation. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in compliance with its terms
and with the requirements of Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code,
except for failures to comply or violations that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. No events have occurred with respect to any Employee
Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in payment or assessment by
or against the Company of any material excise taxes under ERISA or the Code.

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all contributions, premiums
and payments that are due have been made for each Employee Plan within the
time periods prescribed by the terms of such plan and Applicable Law, and all
contributions, premiums and payments for any period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are not due are properly accrued to the extent required to
be accrued under applicable accounting principles. There has been no amendment
to, written interpretation of or announcement (whether or not written) by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Employee Plan that would materially
increase the expense of maintaining such plan above the level of expense
incurred in respect thereof for the most recently completed fiscal year.

(g) Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or together with
any other event) will (i) entitle any current or former Service Provider to
any payment or benefit, including any bonus, retention, severance, retirement
or job security payment or benefit, (ii) enhance any benefits or accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment of funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, or increase the
amount payable or trigger any other obligation under, any Employee Plan or
otherwise, or (iii) limit or restrict the right of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or, after Closing, Parent, to merge, amend or terminate any
Employee Plan. There is no contract, plan or arrangement (written or
otherwise) covering any current or former Service Provider that, individually
or collectively, could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not
be deductible due to the application of Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any current or
projected liability for, and no Employee Plan provides or promises,
any material post-employment or post-retirement medical, dental, disability,
hospitalization, life or similar benefits (whether insured or self-insured) to
any current or former Service Provider (other than (i) coverage mandated by
Applicable Law, including the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1985 (or COBRA) or (ii) any liability for which an accrual or reserve has
been included in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of March 31,
2015 (to the extent of the accrual or reserve therefor) pursuant to the
Employee Plans listed in Section 4.17(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule).

 



35 (i) There is no action, suit, investigation, audit, proceeding or claim (or
any basis therefore) (other than routine claims for benefits) pending against
or involving, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or
involving any Employee Plan before any arbitrator or any Governmental
Authority, including the IRS or the Department of Labor that, if determined
or resolved adversely in accordance with the plaintiffs demands, would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its Subsidiaries are, and have been
since the Applicable Date, in compliance with all Applicable Laws with respect
to labor relations, employment and employment practices, including those
relating to labor management relations, wages, hours, overtime,
employee classification, discrimination, sexual harassment, civil rights,
affirmative action, work authorization, immigration, safety and health,
information privacy and security, workers compensation, continuation coverage
under group health plans, wage payment and the payment and withholding of
Taxes, except for failures to comply or violations that have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(j) Each International Plan (i) has been maintained in compliance with its
terms and Applicable Law, except for failures to comply or violations that
have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) if intended to qualify
for special tax treatment, in all material respects meets the requirements
for such treatment, and (iii) if required, to any extent, to be funded, book-
reserved or secured by an insurance policy, is fully funded, book-reserved or
secured by an insurance policy, as applicable, based on permitted
actuarial assumptions in accordance with applicable accounting principles.

(k) Section 4.17(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth an accurate
and complete list of any collective bargaining agreement or other agreement
with a labor union or like organization that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise bound by, or, as of the date of
this Agreement, is negotiating (each, a "Collective Bargaining Agreement")
with respect to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries located in North
America or South America. Not later than fifteen calendar days after the
date hereof, the Company will provide Parent with a revised version of such
schedule that contains a correct and complete list identifying each Collective
Bargaining Agreement with respect to all employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. None of the Collective Bargaining Agreements referenced in the
preceding sentence (or any liability or obligation thereunder) would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse  

 



36  Effect. Since the Applicable Date, there has not been any organizational
campaign, petition or other unionization activity seeking recognition of a
collective bargaining unit relating to any Service Provider. There are no,
and since the Applicable Date there have not been any, labor strikes,
slowdowns, stoppages, picketings, interruptions of work or lockouts pending

Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no material unfair labor practice
complaints pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations
Board or any other Governmental Authority or any current union representation

rendering of formal advice by, any labor or trade union, works council or
other employee representative body is not required for the Company to enter
into this Agreement or to consummate any of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(l) Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors rights generally and general principles of equity.

(d) There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
obligations of the Financing Sources under the Debt Financing Agreements,
other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements.

 

(e) As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, any other party thereto under any of
the Debt Financing Agreements. As of the date hereof, assuming the accuracy of
the representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein, Parent
has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Agreements will not be satisfied.

 



43 (f) The aggregate proceeds of the Debt Financing, together with cash or cash
equivalents held by Parent, as of the Effective Time, will be sufficient to
enable Parent to pay all amounts required to be paid by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary in cash in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing, including the
aggregate Merger Consideration, repayment of any outstanding indebtedness
required to be repaid in order to consummate the Merger and any fees and
expenses.

 

Section 5.07 _Finders  Fees_. Except for Morgan Stanley and Co. International
plc and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, whose fees will be paid by
Parent, there is no investment banker, broker or finder that has been retained
by or is authorized to act on behalf of Parent who might be entitled to any
fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Subsidiaries authorize any of its or their officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants or other agents or
advisors ("Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate
or take any action to knowingly facilitate the submission of any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations
with, furnish any information

 



47  relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to, otherwise cooperate in any way with, or knowingly assist,
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by any Third Party that is
seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal (provided that the
Company and its Representatives may ascertain facts from the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives) for the sole purpose of the Board of Directors of
the Company informing itself about such Acquisition Proposal and the
Person that made it (and such Persons Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Representatives)), (iii) withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation (or recommend an
Acquisition Proposal) (any of the foregoing in this clause (iii), an "Adverse
Recommendation Change") or (iv) enter into any agreement in principle, letter
of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other
similar instrument to effect an Acquisition Proposal with the Person making
such Acquisition Proposal (or any of its Subsidiaries) (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in compliance with the provisions of
this Section 6.03 and, after such execution of a confidentiality agreement,
any customary engagement, joint defense, clean team or similar agreements) (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). It is agreed that any breach of the
restrictions on the Company set forth in this Section by any Representative
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be a breach of this Section by
the Company.

(b)  _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding Section 6.03(a), at any time prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders:

 

(i) the Company, directly or indirectly through its Representatives or other
intermediaries, may (A) engage in or participate in negotiations or
discussions with any Third Party and its Representatives that, subject to the
Companys compliance with Section 6.03(a), has made an Acquisition Proposal
that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes is or could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) furnish to such
Third Party or its Representatives non-public information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
with such Third Party with terms no less favorable to the Company in the
aggregate than those contained in the confidentiality agreement dated June 25,
2015 between the Company and Parent (the "Confidentiality Agreement") (it
being understood that any such confidentiality agreement need not include a
standstill or prohibit the making or amendment of any Acquisition Proposal);
_provided_ that all such information (to the extent that such information has
not been previously provided or made available to Parent) is provided or made
available to Parent, as the case may be, substantially concurrently with the
time it is provided or made available to such Third Party); and 

 



48 (ii) subject to compliance with Section 6.03(d), the Board of Directors
of the Company may make (A) an Adverse Recommendation Change or take action
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i) to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement in connection with a Superior Proposal or
(B) an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an event or circumstance
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole that was not
known or reasonably foreseeable (or the impact of which was not known or
reasonably foreseeable) to the Board of Directors of the Company or the named
executive officers listed in the Companys Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A,
dated March 6, 2015, as of the date of this Agreement that does not relate to
the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal (an "Intervening Event");

in each case referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) only if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Delaware Law.

 

 __In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
of the Company from (i) complying with disclosure obligations under U.S.
federal or state Applicable Law, including taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, or complying with Rule
14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act or
(ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if, in the good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company, failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with Applicable Law; _provided_ that any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be
an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within five Business Days of such
statement or such action (it being understood and the parties agree that any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication that contains only the information set
forth in Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act shall not be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change). __

 

(c) _Required Notices_. The Board of Directors of the Company shall not take
any of the actions referred to in Section 6.03 unless the Company shall have
delivered to Parent a prior written notice advising Parent that it intends to
take such action, and, after taking such action, the Company shall continue to
advise Parent on a reasonably prompt basis of the material developments in
any negotiations with the Third Party. In addition, the Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall provide such notice in writing and shall identify the material
terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal, including the Third
Party making the

 



49  Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly (but in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of material amendments to the
terms and conditions of any Acquisition Proposal. Any material amendment to
any Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of the Companys compliance with this Section 6.03(c).

 

(d) " _Last Look_ ". Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not
make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal
(or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)) or make an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event, unless (i)
the Company notifies Parent in writing four Business Days prior to taking
that action, of its intention to do so, attaching (A) in the case of an
Adverse Recommendation Change or action to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 10.01(d)(i) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement
in each case, in connection with a Superior Proposal, the most current
version of the proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is
proposed to be consummated, or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation
Change to be made pursuant to an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed
description of the reasons for making such Adverse Recommendation Change and
(ii) Parent does not make, within four Business Days after its receipt of that
written notification, a binding written offer that (A) in the case of any
Adverse Recommendation Change or action to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 10.01(d)(i) to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, in
each case, in connection with a Superior Proposal, causes the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal or (B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change to be made
pursuant to an Intervening Event, obviates the need for such recommendation
change, in each case, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of
the Company. In the event of any material amendment to the financial terms or
other material terms of such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notification and to comply with the
requirements of this Section 6.03(d), except that the Company shall be
required to give three Business Days notice to Parent (instead of the four
Business Days contemplated by the first sentence of this provision).

(e) _Definition of Superior Proposal_. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Superior Proposal" means a _bona fide_ , unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (with the percentages set forth in such term changed from 15% to 75%)
on terms that, if consummated, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after considering the advice of a financial advisor
of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal counsel, are more
favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys stockholders than
the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (taking into account any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.03(d)) and that the Board of Directors of the Company has determined, in its
good faith judgment, is reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance
with its terms, taking into account all legal, regulatory and financial
aspects of the proposal and the Person making the proposal.

 



50 (f) _Obligation to Terminate Existing Discussions_. The Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease
immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party and its
Representatives and its financing sources conducted prior to the date hereof
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall promptly request
that each Third Party, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement
within the 24-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its
consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential
information in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality
agreement.

 

Section 6.04 _Title Insurance_. Subject to Section 6.06, the Company shall,
upon Parents reasonable request and at Parents sole cost and expense,
reasonably cooperate in Parents effort to obtain from Fidelity National Title
Insurance Company, or such other nationally recognized title insurance company
as Parent shall select, owners policies of title insurance (in scope and
coverage reasonably satisfactory to Parent) covering applicable Owned Real
Property located in the United States by providing the title insurance company
with customary endorsements, including a sellers affidavit as to factual
matters or non-imputation affidavit, each in customary form as reasonably
required by such title company (it being understood that any failure of Parent
to secure title insurance shall not affect Parents obligation to consummate
the Merger).

Section 6.05 _Financing Cooperation_. (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to
use their reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its Representatives to use their respective reasonable best efforts
to, provide such reasonable and customary cooperation and information as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with (i) satisfying the
conditions to, and complying with any obligations to assist in the syndication
of, the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Financing Agreements to the
extent such conditions and obligations are consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Section 6.05(c) and Section 6.05(d)
and (ii) arranging any refinancing or replacement financing, whether by way
of debt or equity or hybrid instrument and including entering into definitive
credit facilities, indentures or other instruments or agreements (the
"Replacement Financing Agreements"), the proceeds of which are to be used in
whole or in part to repay or replace the Debt Financing (the "Replacement
Financing" and any financial institutions engaged by Parent to provide or
arrange for the Replacement Financing, the "Replacement Financing Sources")
and satisfying reasonable and customary conditions to the Replacement
Financing to the extent such conditions are consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including Section 6.05(c) and Section 6.05(d).

 



51 (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.05(a), such assistance shall
include, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, using reasonable
efforts to take the following actions:

(i) furnishing financial and other pertinent information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries and its and their businesses (including
information to be used in the preparation of an information package regarding
the business, operations, financial projections and prospects of Parent and

Replacement Financing, including any prospectus or offering memorandum related
thereto, or otherwise necessary for the completion of the Debt Refinancing or
the Replacement Financing) to Parent, Merger Subsidiary and Financing Sources
or Replacement Financing Sources to the extent reasonably requested by the
Parent to assist in preparation of customary offering or
information documents to be used in connection with the Debt Financing or
Replacement Financing and, in respect of Replacement Financing, in advance of

(ii) without limiting the generality of the preceding clause (i), furnishing
reasonably promptly such financial and other pertinent information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent to

trading (including historical and pro forma financial statements and
information) and other documents required to satisfy any customary negative
assurance opinion, for one or more periods required to consummate the

consummated, _provided_ that no such information shall be required to be
furnished to the extent that such information is publicly available (including

Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to Parent, its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating
data and other

 



55 _ _ information as Parent may reasonably request, _provided_ that the Company
shall not be required to permit any inspection, or disclose any document or
information, that would, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, (w)
result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of any third parties or violate
the terms of any confidentiality provisions in any agreement with a third
party entered into prior to the date of this Agreement (or entered into after
the date of this Agreement in compliance with Section 6.01), (x) result in a
violation of Applicable Law, including any fiduciary duty, (y) waive the

of any sensitive or personal information that would expose the Company to the
risk of liability. If any material is withheld by the Company pursuant to the
proviso to the preceding sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to the
general nature of what is being withheld and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate to make appropriate substitute arrangements to permit reasonable
disclosure that does not suffer from any of the foregoing impediments,
including through the use of redaction, clean team arrangements or other
appropriate solutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time,
neither Parent nor any of its representatives will be permitted to perform
any invasive environmental procedure with respect to any property of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No information or knowledge obtained in

ARTICLE 7

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

Parent agrees that:

 

Section 7.01 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary_. Immediately after
the execution of this Agreement, Parent, as sole stockholder of Merger
Subsidiary, shall adopt and approve this Agreement, the performance by Merger
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder and the consummation of the Merger on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement by an action by consent
in lieu of a meeting of the stockholders of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall
take all action necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.02 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote or cause to be voted all
shares of Company Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries
or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries has the power (by
agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted in favor of adoption and
approval of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

 



56 Section 7.03 _Director and Officer Liability_. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation, and each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
hereby agrees, to do the following:

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers, directors
and employees of the Company (each, an "Indemnified Person"), in each case, to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnified Persons services
as a director or officer of the Company, as a director, officer or member of
any Subsidiaries of the Company or as a trustee or fiduciary of any pension
or other employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i) Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to enforce
this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnified Person. Expenses incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending
or investigating a threatened or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that may be the subject of indemnification pursuant to this
Section 7.03(a) shall be paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such
Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined
that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by Parent and the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Section 7.03(a).

(b) For six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate
of incorporation and bylaws that are in effect as of the date hereof (or in
such documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation)
regarding elimination of liability of directors, indemnification of officers,
directors and employees and advancement of expenses that are no less
advantageous to the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions
in existence on the date of this Agreement.

(c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for not less
than six years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Persons and any
other employees, agents or other individuals otherwise covered by such
insurance policies prior to the Effective Time (the "Insured Persons"), or
prior to the Effective Time, at the Companys option, the Company may or, if
the Company is unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of
the Effective Time

 



57  to, obtain and fully pre-pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension
of the directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries
(collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time with
respect to any claim related to any period of time at or prior to the
Effective Time (including the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are no less favorable to the Insured Persons than the coverage provided
under the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policies (including in
connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions or
actions contemplated hereby), which policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect for its full term. In no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the last annual premium (the
"Maximum Premium") the Company paid prior to the date hereof; and _provided
further_ that if the aggregate premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the
Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding the Maximum
Premium.

 

(d) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 7.03.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under
Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. These rights
shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and
shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

 

Section 7.04 _Employee Matters_. (a) During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date (or
such shorter period of employment, as the case may be), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each employee who is actively
employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (each, a
"Covered Employee"), a base salary or base wage, target annual bonus and long-
term incentive compensation opportunities, broad-based severance entitlements
and pension, welfare and other employee benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or base wage, target annual
bonus and long-term

 



58  incentive compensation opportunities, broad-based severance entitlements and
pension, welfare and other employee benefits provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to such Covered Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The requirements of this Section 7.04(a) shall not apply to Covered
Employees who are covered by a Collective Bargaining Agreement.

 

(b) _Crediting of Payments_. In the event any Covered Employee first becomes
eligible to participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy or
arrangement of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "Parent Plan")
following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, use reasonable best efforts to: (i) waive any preexisting condition
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such Covered Employee under any Parent Plan
providing medical, dental or vision benefits to the same extent such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Employee Plan such
Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage under such
Parent Plan and (ii) provide such Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid under an Employee Plan prior to such Covered
Employees coverage under any Parent Plan during the calendar year in which
such amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the
Employee Plan such Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to
coverage under such Parent Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible or
out-of-pocket requirements under such Parent Plan.

 

(c) _Service Crediting_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, recognize all service of each Covered Employee
prior to the Effective Time with the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes
of vesting, determination of benefit level (including, without limitation,
with respect to vacation and severance entitlements, but excluding benefit
accrual or benefit levels under defined benefit pension plans or retiree
welfare plans) and eligibility to participate in any Parent Plan, as if such
service had been performed with Parent, except to the extent it would result
in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service or to the
extent such service was not recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time
under a comparable Employee Plan.

 

(d) _Company 401(k) Plans_. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent at least five Business
Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate the Companys
Employees Savings Plan and Employees Savings and Profit Sharing Plan
(collectively, the "Company 401(k) Plans"), pursuant to resolutions of the
Companys Board of Directors that are reasonably satisfactory to Parent. In
connection with the termination of the Company 401(k) Plans, Parent shall,
subject to the terms of any applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement,
permit each eligible Covered Employee to become a participant in an "eligible
retirement plan" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Parent 401(k) Plan") and make
rollover contributions of

 



59  "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code, including all participant loans) in cash or notes (in the case of
participant loans) in an amount equal to the eligible rollover distribution
portion of the account balance distributed to each such Covered Employee from
such plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan. During the period beginning at the
Effective Time and ending on December 31, 2017, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, provide to each Covered Employee who, as of the
Effective Time, received non-discretionary transition credits pursuant to the
terms of the Company Employees Savings Plan and who commences participation
in the Parent 401(k) Plan, transition credits calculated in accordance with
the terms of the Company Employees Savings Plan as in effect on the date
hereof, but only to the extent such transition credits were reflected on the
financial projections of the Company provided to Parent prior to the date
hereof. In the event the tax qualification requirements of the Code applicable
to the Parent 401(k) Plan (including, without limitation, non-
discrimination requirements) would reduce Parents ability to comply with the
conditions of the foregoing sentence, and, after using reasonable best
efforts, Parent is unable to provide the non-discretionary transition credits
pursuant to the Parent 401(k) Plan as required by this Section 7.04(d), any
such transition credits that cannot be provided by the Parent 401(k) Plan
shall be taken into account for purposes of the requirements of Section
7.04(a).

 

(e) _Annual Bonuses_. The Company shall be permitted to finally and
conclusively determine, in good faith and in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, the amounts earned, (i) based on funding (A) at
actual performance levels with respect to applicable financial metrics and (B)
at the greater of actual or target performance levels with respect to
applicable key non-financial performance metrics under the Company Annual
Incentive Compensation Plan and the Company Employee Incentive Plan and (ii)
based on funding at actual performance levels with respect to all applicable
performance metrics under the Company Sales Incentive Plans, in each case, in
respect of the 2015 calendar year, and pay such bonus amounts in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, but no later than the
Closing Date. In the event a Covered Employees employment is terminated
after June 30, 2016 and prior to December 31, 2016 by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates without "cause" (as such
term is defined in the Company Employee Income Continuity Plan) or by such
Covered Employee for "good reason" (as such term is defined in Section 7.04(e)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule), such employee shall, no later than 30
calendar days following such termination, be paid a bonus award for the 2016
calendar year under the annual bonus plan applicable to such employee, based
on target performance levels and prorated for the portion of the 2016 calendar
year (based on calendar days) elapsed between January 1, 2016 and the
effective date of such Covered Employees termination of employment.

 



60 (f) _Performance Cash Awards_. As of the Effective Time, each performance cash
award granted under the Company Stock Plan shall, as required by the terms of
the Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreements as in effect on the
date hereof, vest at maximum performance, and each holder thereof shall remain
subject to the service-based vesting component of such award in accordance
with the terms of the Company Stock Plan and applicable award agreements as in
effect at the date hereof.

 

(g) _Retention Program_. The Company shall be permitted to establish a
retention bonus plan in accordance with the parameters set forth on Section
7.04(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(h) _ESPP_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
actions, including adopting any resolutions or amendments, that are necessary
to (i) prohibit further or increased enrollment in, or contributions under,
the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan from those in effect on the date
hereof and (ii) terminate the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(i) _Employee Plan Termination_. Prior to the Closing Date, subject to
Section 7.04(j) and except to the extent precluded by the terms of any
Employee Plan, an applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement or by Applicable
Law, the Company shall take all actions that may be necessary or appropriate
to cause each Employee Plan that, not later than thirty calendar days prior to
the Closing Date, Parent requests that the Company terminate in accordance
with the terms of such plan. All resolutions, notices, participant
communications or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection
with the termination of such Employee Plans shall be subject to Parents prior
review and approval.

 

(j) _Continuing Obligations_. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, honor in accordance with their respective contractual terms
all employee benefit obligations to current and former employees under each
Employee Plan set forth on Section 7.04(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 

(k) _Labor Groups_. Subject to Section 4.17(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the parties agree to work together in good faith to consult with or
obtain the consent of any labor or trade union, works council or other
employee representative body as may be required to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(l) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section
7.04, express or implied, (i) is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto, including any Covered Employee or any former
employee, director, officer or individual independent contract of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever

 



61  under or by reason of this Agreement, (ii) shall establish, or constitute an
amendment, termination or modification of, or an undertaking to amend,
establish, terminate or modify, any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, (iii) shall alter or limit the ability of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them or (iv) shall create any obligation on the part of
Parent or its Subsidiaries (or, following the Effective Time, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries) to employ any Covered Employee for any period
following the Closing Date.

Section 7.05 _Indemnification Related to Financing_. Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
agents, investment bankers and other Representatives from and against any and
all losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of
the Debt Financing, any Replacement Financing and the performance of their
respective obligations under Section 6.05 (including any action taken in
accordance with Section 6.05) and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than to the extent arising from the willful misconduct, gross
negligence, fraud or bad faith of any indemnified Person). Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with Section 6.05 (including those of its
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents, investment bankers and other
Representatives). Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that the obtaining of the
Debt Financing or the Replacement Financing (or any other financing) is not a
condition to Closing.

 

Section 7.06 _Conduct of Business of Parent and Merger Subsidiary Pending the
Merger_. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, between the
date of this Agreement and the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article 10, it shall not, and
it shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
take any action with respect to the Debt Financing or any Replacement
Financing that would, or would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, cause Parent to fail at Closing to have funds sufficient to (i)
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) pay the fees and expenses
required to be paid by Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Surviving Corporation
in connection with the Merger, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt
Financing and any Replacement Financing.

(b) Parent will take all actions necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to
perform its obligations (if any) under the Debt Financing and any Replacement
Financing.

 



62 Section 7.07 _Debt Financing_. (a) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange, maintain the effectiveness of and consummate the Debt
Financing (except to the extent replaced by Replacement Financing) and the
Replacement Financing on the terms and conditions described in or contemplated
by the Debt Financing Agreements or Replacement Financing Agreement (as
applicable) (including complying with any request to exercise so-called
"flex" provisions and using reasonable best efforts to satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions to funding in the Debt Financing Agreements or
Replacement Financing Agreements (as applicable)) in such amount which,
when taken together with Parents and Merger Subsidiarys cash on hand, would
be no less than the amount that would be required to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Debt Financing
or Replacement Financing (as applicable), including the aggregate Merger
Consideration, repayment of any outstanding indebtedness required to be repaid
in order to consummate the Merger and any fees and expenses.

 

(b) To the extent reasonably requested by the Company from time to time,
Parent shall (subject to any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions on
disclosure) keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis of the
status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing or
Replacement Financing (as applicable). Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall not
(without the prior written consent of the Company) consent or agree to any
amendment, supplement, modification or replacement of the Debt Financing
Agreements (including cancellation of commitments thereunder following the
entry into any Replacement Financing Agreement) if such amendment,
supplement, modification or replacement could, in Parents reasonable
determination, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Promptly following any material amendment, supplement or modification of
any Debt Financing Agreement or Replacement Financing Agreement made in
compliance with this Section 7.07, Parent shall provide a copy thereof
(redacted if necessary where appropriate and customary) to the Company and the
term "Debt Financing Agreements" or "Replacement Financing Agreements" shall
(as applicable) mean the Debt Financing Agreements or Replacement Financing
Agreements as so amended, supplemented or modified and Parents obligations
under this Section 7.07 shall apply with respect thereto. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 7.07, in no event shall Parent or Merger
Subsidiary be required (I) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions of
the Debt Financing Agreements or Replacement Financing Agreements or pay any
fees in excess of or not contemplated thereunder or (II) to consummate the
Closing any earlier than the time set forth in Section 2.01, provided, that,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Debt Financing, or any Replacement Financing or other financing, is not a
condition to Closing.

contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) preparing and filing, or
cooperating in the preparing and filing, as applicable, as promptly as

and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement if agreeing to such

product lines or businesses or interests therein of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unless the effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the

as may be required under any Applicable Law.

(c) Within fourteen calendar days of the date hereof, each of Parent and the
Company agrees to use reasonable best efforts to agree upon the definitive
list of jurisdictions in which any notice, filing or other instrument is
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Competition Laws in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon such agreement,
Section 9.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedules shall be updated to
reflect such definitive list.

with respect to the Company Proxy Statement from the SEC.

 



66 Section 8.03 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release by each of
Parent and the Company with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall
be in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company. Neither the
Company nor Parent (nor any of their respective controlled Affiliates) shall
issue any other press release or make any other public announcement with
respect to this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby without prior consultation with the other parties, except as may be
required by Applicable Law or by any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts
to consult in good faith with the other party before making any such
public announcements; provided that the Company will not be required to
consult with Parent in connection with any such press release or public
announcement if the Companys Board of Directors has effected an Adverse
Recommendation Change (including in connection with any press release or
public announcement relating to such Adverse Recommendation Change).

Section 8.04 _Notices of Certain Events_. Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other of:

(a) subject to Applicable Law, any written notice or other written

matter of such communication would reasonably be expected to be material
to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent; and

(b) any change, fact or condition at any time during the term hereof that
is reasonably expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or to
cause the conditions set forth in Article 9 not to be satisfied;

_provided _ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.04
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice or result in a failure to satisfy the conditions
set forth in Article 9. __

Parent have previously executed the Confidentiality Agreement, which will

Section 11.03 _Amendments and Waivers_. (a) Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided that after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver
that would require the further approval of the stockholders of the Company
under Delaware Law without such approval having first been obtained.

 



73 (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. Except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable
Law.

 

Section 11.04 _Expenses_. (a) _General_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such cost or expense.

(b) _Termination Fee_.

 

(i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(c)(i)
or Section 10.01(c)(iii), or by the Company pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i),
then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately available funds
$140,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"), in the case of a termination by Parent,
within one Business Day after such termination and, in the case of a
termination by the Company, immediately before and as a condition to such
termination.

 

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 10.01(b)(iii), (B) after the date of this Agreement and prior to such
termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
otherwise been communicated to the Board of Directors of the Company or its
stockholders and (C) within 12 months following the date of such termination,
the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with respect to or
recommended to its stockholders an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been consummated, then the Company shall pay to Parent,
within five Business Days after the earlier of such entry into a definitive
agreement with respect to, recommendation to the Company stockholders of or
consummation of, such Acquisition Proposal, in immediately available funds,
the Termination Fee.

(c) _Other Costs and Expenses_. The Company acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 11.04 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee when due to Parent pursuant
to this Section 11.04, it shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary in connection with a legal action to enforce this
Agreement that results in a judgment against the Company for such amount,
together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the
publicly announced prime rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost
or expense

 



74  was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the parties hereby acknowledge
that in the event that the Termination Fee becomes payable and is paid by the
Company pursuant to this Section 11.04, the Termination Fee shall be Parents
and Merger Subsidiarys sole and exclusive remedy for monetary damages under
this Agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that only one Termination
Fee shall be payable by the Company as set forth in Section 11.04(b) and in no
event shall any such Termination Fee be payable by the Company on more than
one occasion.

 

Section 11.05 _Disclosure Schedule and SEC Document References_. (a) The
parties hereto agree that any information contained in a particular Section
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
any Section of this Agreement to which the relevance of such information is
reasonably apparent. The Company has or may have set forth information in its
disclosure schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the Section of
this Agreement to which it relates. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the inclusion of an
item in either disclosure schedule as an exception thereto will not be deemed
an admission that such item represents a material exception or material fact,
event or circumstance, that such item is required to be disclosed by this
Agreement or that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 __(b) The parties hereto agree that any information contained in any part of
any Company SEC Document shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or a
disclosure for purposes of) the Company s representations and warranties if
the relevance of that information as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such representations and warranties would be reasonably apparent
to a person who has read that information concurrently with such
representations and warranties, without any independent knowledge on the part
of the reader regarding the matter(s) so disclosed; _provided_ that in no
event shall any information contained in any part of any Company SEC Document
entitled "Risk Factors" or containing a description or explanation of
"Forward-Looking Statements" be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure
for purposes of) any representations and warranties of the Company contained
in this Agreement. __

Section 11.06 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. (a) The provisions of
this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as provided in Section 7.03
and this Section 11.06, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section 7.03
and in Section 11.06(b) below, no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns except

 



75  that, and notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the
Company shall have the right to recover through an action brought by the
Company for itself and on behalf of its stockholders, damages (which shall be
determined by reference to the total amount that would have been recoverable
by the Companys stockholders if all such stockholders brought an action
against Parent and were recognized as third party beneficiaries hereunder)
from Parent in the event of a knowing and intentional breach of this Agreement
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, or fraud, which right is hereby acknowledged
and agreed by Parent and Merger Subsidiary. The rights of third party
beneficiaries under Section 7.03 shall not arise unless and until the
Effective Time occurs.

(b) None of the Financing Sources will have any liability to the Company, any
former, current or future stockholders, equity holders, controlling persons,
directors, officers, employees, general or limited partners, members,
managers, agents or affiliates of the Company, or any former, current or
future direct or indirect stockholder, equity holder, controlling person,
director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager,
agent or affiliate of any of the foregoing (each, a "Related Party"),
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, whether at law, or equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any Related Party
will have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources hereunder. None of this Section 11.06(b), Section 11.08(b) or the
definitions related hereto may be amended in a manner adverse to the interests
of the Financing Sources without their prior written consent. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Financing Sources shall
be deemed to be third-party beneficiaries of this Section 11.06(b) and Section
11.08(b) and (ii) this Section 11.06(b) and Section 11.08(b) shall be
enforceable by Parent on behalf of any relevant Financing Source. Nothing in
this Section 11.06(b) shall be interpreted as limiting the ability of (A) the
Company or any Related Party or any Affiliate of the Company, following the
Closing Date, to exercise any of its rights and remedies under any agreement
relating to the Debt Financing or Replacement Financing in accordance with its
terms or (B) Parent or any Affiliate of Parent from enforcing any of its
rights and remedies prior to the Closing under the Debt Financing Agreements
or any Replacement Financing Agreements).

(c) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, (i) by written notice to the Company to another wholly-owned direct or
indirect Subsidiary to participate in the Merger in lieu of Merger Subsidiary,
in which event all references herein to Merger Subsidiary shall be deemed
references to such other Subsidiary, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Subsidiary as of the date of
this Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with
respect to such other Subsidiary

 



76 _ _ as of the date of such designation; _provided_ that any such designation
shall not materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise materially
impair the rights of the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement and
(ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto
or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary. __

 

Section 11.07 _Governing Law_. (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company acknowledges
and agrees that to the extent Closing does not occur, any lawsuit, claim,
complaint or action, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating
to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules that would result in the application of
the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Section 11.08 _Jurisdiction_. (a) The parties hereto agree that any suit,
action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any
matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its
Affiliates or against any party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in
the Delaware Chancery Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction
of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any
such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within
or without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section
11.01 shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company acknowledges
and agrees (i) that any lawsuit, claim, complaint or action, whether in law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing Agreements, the Debt Financing or the
performance

 



77  of services thereunder or related thereto shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York, New York, and any appellate court thereof, (ii) not to
bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in
bringing any such lawsuit, claim, complaint or action in any other court,
(iii) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
lawsuit, claim, complaint or action in any such court, (iv) to waive and
hereby waive any right to trial by jury in respect of any such lawsuit, claim,
complaint or action and (v) that a final judgment in any such lawsuit, claim,
complaint or action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Section 11.08(b) shall be interpreted as limiting the ability
of (A) the Company or any Related Party or any Affiliate of the Company,
following the Closing Date, to exercise any of its rights and remedies under
any agreement relating to the Debt Financing or Replacement Financing in
accordance with its terms or (B) Parent or any Affiliate of Parent from
enforcing any of its rights and remedies prior to the Closing under the Debt
Financing Agreements or any Replacement Financing Agreements).

Section 11.09 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY
TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.09.

 

Section 11.10 _Counterparts; Effectiveness_. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart or counterparts hereof signed by all of the
other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart
or counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto, this
Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation
hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication).

 



78 Section 11.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. No
party shall be bound by, or liable for, any alleged representation, promise,
inducement or statement of intention not contained herein.

 

Section 11.12 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 11.13 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
therefor and therefore fully intend for specific performance to be
an available remedy for breaches of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any Delaware state court, without proof of actual damages, this
being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Applicable Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific performance
on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages (or any other remedy at law)
would provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party further
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 11.13
are an integral part of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other party (in the
case of the Company) or parties (in the case of Parent and Merger Subsidiary)
would not enter into this Agreement. Each party further agrees that no other
party hereto or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post
any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to

 



79  obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 11.13, and each party
hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the Company or any Related Party be entitled
