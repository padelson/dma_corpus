iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of March 9, 2015 (this
"Agreement"), is entered into by and between Western Alliance Bancorporation
("WAL"), a Delaware corporation, and Bridge Capital Holdings, a California
corporation ("Bridge").

 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of WAL and Bridge have determined that it is
in the best interests of their respective companies and stockholders to
consummate the business combination transaction provided for herein in which
WAL will acquire Bridge through the merger of Bridge with and into WAL, with
WAL surviving (the "Merger");

 

WHEREAS, contemporaneous with the execution of this Agreement, each of the
directors and executive officers of Bridge, and Carpenter Fund Manager GP,
LLC, each solely in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Bridge, have
executed an agreement with WAL containing certain covenants, without which
covenants WAL would not have agreed to the Merger (the "Support Agreements");

WHEREAS, contemporaneous with the execution of this Agreement, each of Daniel
P. Myers, Thomas A. Sa and Timothy W. Boothe and certain other executive
officers and employees of Bridge have executed an agreement which reflects the
terms of such persons continuing employment with WAL, the effectiveness of
which is subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time (the "Employment
Agreements");

WHEREAS, contemporaneous with the execution of this Agreement, certain
executive officers of Bridge have executed a protection agreement, the
effectiveness of which is subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time (the
"Protection Agreements");

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms shall have the meanings
set forth in Section 9.13;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL") and the California Corporations Code (the "CCC"), at the Effective
Time, Bridge will merge into WAL, with WAL being the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger. Upon
consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Bridge shall
cease.

1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the
time specified in the Certificate of Merger as filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (the "DE Certificate of Merger") and the
Agreement of Merger, substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
, as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California (the "CA
Agreement of Merger"), as applicable. The term "Effective Time" shall be the
date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the DE
Certificate of Merger and the CA Agreement of Merger.

1.3 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
DGCL and the CCC.

1.4 Conversion of Bridge Common Stock. (a) At the Effective Time, subject to Sections 1.4(b), 1.4(c) and 1.4(d)
and Section 1.5, each share of Bridge common stock, no par value per share
("Bridge Common Stock"), issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
(excluding Dissenters Shares and all unvested shares of Bridge
Restricted Stock but, for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated
rights to purchase capital stock of Bridge issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement, and any shares of Bridge Common Stock issued as of the Effective
Time by reason of the exercise of options to acquire Bridge Common Stock)
shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, (i) 0.8145
shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
WAL ("WAL Common Stock") (the "Stock Consideration") and (ii) $2.39 in cash
(the "Cash Consideration") (the consideration described in clauses (i) and
(ii) and the Cash Out Amount (defined below), the "Merger Consideration").

(b) No Dissenters Shares shall be converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this Section 1.4, but instead shall be treated in accordance with
the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(a).

(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Bridge Common Stock that are owned
by Bridge as treasury stock and all shares of Bridge Common Stock that are
owned directly or indirectly by WAL or Bridge, including any shares of Bridge
Common Stock held by WAL or Bridge or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
respect of a debt previously contracted, other than shares that are held by
WAL, if any, in a fiduciary capacity, shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor. All shares of WAL Common Stock that are owned by Bridge shall become
treasury stock of WAL.

__(d) Subject to the potential adjustment that may be made to the Exchange
Ratio pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement and as provided in Section
1.9(b) of this Agreement, the aggregate Merger Consideration to be issued or
paid shall not exceed 12,494,704 shares of WAL Common Stock and $36,663,403
of cash; _provided_ that for each share of Bridge Common Stock that is issued,
from and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the
exercise of Bridge Stock Options and the vesting of Bridge Restricted Stock,
either (i) outstanding as of the date hereof other than any Bridge Restricted
Stock that vests pursuant to the agreements set forth on schedule 1.5 of the
Bridge Disclosure Schedule or (ii) granted or issued after the date hereof
pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the maximum
aggregate Merger Consideration referred to in this subsection shall be
increased by 0.8145 shares of WAL Common Stock and $2.39 in cash. In the
event that the foregoing clauses of this Section 1.4 result in more total
Merger Consideration than specified in the previous sentence, then the total
Merger Consideration calculated under Section 1.4(a) (including the Cash Out
Amount and giving effect to Dissenting Shares as if they had been converted
under Section 1.4(a)) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to the aggregate
amount set forth in this Section 1.4(d). __

 

1.5 Options and Other Stock-Based Awards.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding, vested and
unexercised option to purchase Bridge Common Stock granted under the Bridge
Stock Plans (defined below) and each holder of an outstanding and unexercised
option that will become vested coincident with or immediately prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms in effect under the agreements
and arrangements listed in Section 1.5 of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule
(other than any requirement of separation from service) (each, a "Bridge Stock
Option") may elect to exercise any such option in accordance with the
other terms thereof (an "Exercise Election"), contingent on the consummation
of the Merger, and shall receive, for any shares of Bridge Common Stock
acquired in such election, the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
1.4. In the event of any such Exercise Election, all shares of Bridge Common
Stock underlying such exercised options will be deemed to have been issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time for purposes of Section
1.4. If the Merger is not completed, any options for which an Exercise
Election has been made will remain outstanding. At the Effective Time, any
outstanding, vested and unexercised option for which an Exercise Election has
not been made shall be canceled and in exchange for such cancellation the
optionee shall receive an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the
product of (i) the excess of (A) the Closing Price over (B) the exercise price
per share of such option and (ii) the number of shares of Bridge Common Stock
subject to such option (in the aggregate, the "Cash Out Amount"), which cash
payment shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any applicable
federal or state withholding tax. At the Effective Time, any outstanding,
vested and unexercised option for which an Exercise Election has not been made
the exercise price per share of which exceeds the Closing Price shall be
converted automatically into an Adjusted Option (defined below), and shall be
treated in the same manner as an unvested Bridge Stock Option in accordance
with Section 1.5(b) hereof.

 



2 (b) At the Effective Time, each unvested Bridge Stock Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Bridge Common Stock
and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of
shares of WAL Common Stock (each, an "Adjusted Option") equal to the product
of (x) the total number of shares of Bridge Common Stock subject to such
Bridge Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) 0.905
(the "Equity Award Exchange Ratio"), with any fractional shares rounded down
to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted Option shall have an
exercise price per share of WAL Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to (i) the per share exercise price for the shares of Bridge
Common Stock subject to such Bridge Stock Option divided by (ii) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio. Each Adjusted Option shall otherwise be subject to the
same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Bridge Stock Option
under the applicable Bridge Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, including as to vesting. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, in all cases, the exercise price of, and the number of
shares subject to, each Adjusted Option shall be determined as necessary to
comply with Section 409A of the Code, and for any Bridge Stock Option to
which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under
any of Sections 422 through 424 of the Code, the option price, the number of
shares subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such
option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the Code.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Bridge Stock Plans" means the Bridge Bank
Amended and Restated 2001 Stock Option Plan, as amended, and the Bridge
Capital Holdings 2006 Equity Incentive Plan, and any other agreement
providing for the grant of options.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, all outstanding and vested shares of Bridge
Restricted Stock that are outstanding and vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any Bridge Restricted Stock that will become vested
coincident with or immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with
the terms in effect under the agreements and arrangements listed in Section
1.5 of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule (other than any requirement of
separation from service)), as of the Effective Time, shall be a vested right
to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 1.4(a). At the
Effective Time, each share of Bridge Restricted Stock that is outstanding and
unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to
represent a right or award with respect to shares of Bridge Common Stock and
shall be converted automatically into a share of restricted WAL Common Stock
(each, an "Adjusted Restricted Share") equal to the product of (x) the number
of shares of Bridge Restricted Stock and (y) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio
(and rounded, as applicable, to the nearest whole share, with 0.50 being
rounded upward). Each Adjusted Restricted Share shall otherwise be subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Bridge
Restricted Stock under the applicable Bridge Stock Plan and the agreements
evidencing grants thereunder, including as to vesting.

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Bridge, the Board of Directors of
Bridge and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take all actions that are reasonably necessary to effectuate
the provisions of this Section 1.5 and (ii) WAL, the Board of Directors of WAL
and its compensation committee, as applicable, shall take such actions as are
reasonably necessary for the assumption by WAL of the Adjusted Options, and
the Adjusted Restricted Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, WAL shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8
registering a number of shares of WAL Common Stock necessary to fulfill WALs
obligations under this Section 1.5 and shall maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement for so long as any Adjusted Options, or Adjusted
Restricted Shares remain outstanding.

1.6 Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the certificate
of incorporation of WAL, as in effect at the Effective Time, shall be the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

1.7 Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of WAL, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

1.8 Directors and Officers. The directors of WAL immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, each of
whom shall serve in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation; _provided, however,_ that, prior to the
Effective Time, all necessary action shall have been taken by WAL in order
that, at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors of
Surviving Corporation occurring after the Effective Time, WAL shall expand the
size of its Board of Directors by two (2) seats in connection with the Merger
and designate two (2) members of Bridges Board of

 



3  Directors to be named after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time,
each of whom meets the qualifications for directors set forth in the bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation and is mutually agreed upon by WAL and Bridge prior
to the Effective Time, to serve on the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation (the "Bridge Director Designees"). The Bridge Director Designees
shall be appointed to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation in
a manner such that the classes of the Board of Directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be as nearly equal in number as possible. At the Effective
Time, the officers of WAL immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
officers of the Surviving Corporation and, pursuant to the terms of his
employment agreement, Daniel P. Myers shall become an officer of the Surviving
Corporation, and shall serve in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.9 Tax Consequences.

 

(a) It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and applicable Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Code"), and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization"
for purposes of the Code.

 

(b) If either the tax opinion referred to in Section 7.2(e) or the tax opinion
referred to in Section 7.3(e) cannot be rendered (as reasonably determined,
in each case, by the counsel charged with giving such opinion) as a result of
the Merger potentially failing to satisfy the "continuity of interest"
requirements under applicable federal income tax principles relating to
reorganizations under Section 368(a) of the Code, then WAL shall reduce the
Cash Consideration (and increase the Stock Consideration accordingly) to the
minimum extent necessary to enable the relevant tax opinions to be rendered. 

1.10 Bank Merger. In connection with the consummation of the Merger, Bridge
Bank, National Association, a national banking association chartered under
the laws of the United States and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bridge ("Bridge
Bank"), will enter into a merger agreement (the "Bank Merger Agreement"),
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , providing for the
merger (the "Bank Merger") of Bridge Bank with and into Western Alliance Bank,
an Arizona-chartered bank and wholly owned subsidiary of WAL ("WAB"), with WAB
being the surviving bank of the Bank Merger ("Surviving Bank").

1.11 Possible Alternative Structures. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, WAL shall be entitled to revise the
structure of the Bank Merger, including, without limitation, the possible
postponement or elimination thereof, if necessary for regulatory or other
reasonable business or Tax reason, _provided_ that (i) there are no adverse
federal or state income tax consequences to Bridge shareholders as a result of
the modification (including no impact upon the opinions of counsel to be
delivered pursuant to Sections 7.2(e) and 7.3(e) of this Agreement); (ii) the
consideration to be paid to each holder of record of Bridge Common Stock
(other than Dissenters Shares) ("Holder") under this Agreement is not thereby
changed in kind or value or reduced in amount as a result of such change in
structure; (iii) such modification will not materially delay or jeopardize
receipt of any required regulatory approvals or other consents and approvals
relating to the consummation of the Merger; (iv) such modification will not
impede or materially delay consummation of the Merger; and (v) such
modification will not otherwise cause any of the conditions set forth in
Article VII not to be capable of being fulfilled unless duly waived by the
party entitled to the benefits thereof. Each of the parties hereto agrees to
appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order to
reflect any such revised structure for the Bank Merger.

 

1.12 Bridge Bank Brand. It is the current intention of WAL that, from and
after the Effective Time, WAL will continue to use the "Bridge Bank" name
across Bridges product lines as part of the WAL franchise in the San
Francisco Bay Area and at existing Bridge offices outside of California.

 

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

2.1 Exchange of Shares.

 



4 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, WAL will deposit with a bank or trust company
designated by WAL (the "Exchange Agent") certificates (which may be in
electronic form) representing shares of WAL Common Stock ("WAL Stock
Certificates") sufficient to pay in a timely manner, and WAL shall instruct
the Exchange Agent to timely pay, the aggregate Stock Consideration. In
addition, prior to the Effective Time, WAL shall deposit with the Exchange
Agent sufficient cash to permit prompt payment of the Cash Consideration, the
cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common Stock and the Cash Out
Amount, and WAL shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash
Consideration, the cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common Stock and
the Cash Out Amount.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, WAL shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each Holder of a Bridge stock
certificate(s) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Bridge Common Stock ("Bridge Stock Certificates") whose
shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 and any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of WAL Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, (i)
a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Bridge Stock Certificate(s) shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Bridge Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in
lieu of such certificates) to the Exchange Agent) and shall be substantially
in such form and have such other provisions as shall reasonably be determined
by WAL (the "Letter of Transmittal"), and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering the Bridge Stock Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.1(j) and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(i).

(c) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Bridge Stock Certificate(s),
accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a Holder will be
entitled to receive promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares in respect of the shares of Bridge
Common Stock represented by its Bridge Stock Certificate. Until so
surrendered, each such Bridge Stock Certificate shall represent after the
Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.1(j) and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(i).

 

(d) In the case of outstanding shares of Bridge Common Stock that are not
represented by Bridge Stock Certificates, the parties shall make
such adjustments and take or cause to be taken such actions as are necessary
or appropriate to implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.1
will have with respect to shares of Bridge Common Stock that are represented
by Bridge Stock Certificates.

(e) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name a Bridge Stock Certificate so surrendered is
registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that such Bridge Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall inform the Exchange
Agent whether any transfer or other similar Taxes are required as a result of
such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Bridge Stock
Certificate, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Taxes are not payable. If such transfer or other similar Taxes are
payable pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Exchange Agent shall
withhold and deduct from the Merger Consideration (including Stock
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common Stock)
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to the designated Person other
than the registered holder such amounts as the Exchange Agent determines is
necessary based on the information supplied by the registered holder. The
Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the six-month anniversary of the Effective
Time, WAL) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration (including Stock Consideration and cash in lieu of
fractional shares of WAL Common Stock) otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Bridge Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange
Agent or WAL, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under the
Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that any amounts are withheld by the
Exchange Agent or WAL, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of shares of Bridge Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or WAL, as the case may be.

 



5 (f) After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration or
transfers of shares of Bridge Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Bridge Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

(g) At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, WAL
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
remaining portion of the Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional
shares of WAL Common Stock not distributed to Holders of shares of Bridge
Common Stock that was deposited with the Exchange Agent at the Effective
Time (the "Exchange Fund") (including any interest received with respect
thereto and other income resulting from investments by the Exchange Agent, as
directed by WAL), and Holders shall be entitled to look only to WAL (subject
to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) with respect to the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common
Stock and any dividends or other distributions with respect to WAL Common
Stock payable upon due surrender of their Bridge Stock Certificates, without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither WAL nor the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Holder of a Bridge Stock Certificate for
Merger Consideration (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund in each case delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(h) In the event any Bridge Stock Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Bridge Stock Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by WAL or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such sum as WAL may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Bridge Stock Certificate(s), WAL shall cause the Exchange Agent to issue the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares of Bridge Common
Stock represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Bridge Stock
Certificates.

(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to WAL Common Stock with
a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Bridge Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of WAL
Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to subsection (j) below, and
all such dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional shares
of WAL Common Stock shall be paid by WAL to the Exchange Agent and shall be
included in the Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender of such
Bridge Stock Certificate in accordance with subsection (c) above. Subject to
the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws,
following surrender of any such Bridge Stock Certificate there shall be paid
to the Holder, the Merger Consideration, including a WAL Stock Certificate,
or, at WALs option, evidence of shares of WAL Common Stock in book entry
form, for WAL Common Stock representing whole shares of WAL Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
WAL Common Stock and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of WAL Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to
subsection (j), and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of WAL Common Stock. WAL
shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash for these purposes,
if necessary.

(j) No WAL Stock Certificates representing fractional shares of WAL Common
Stock shall be issued, or book entries representing fractional shares of WAL
Common Stock made, upon the surrender for exchange of Bridge Stock
Certificates; no dividend or distribution by WAL shall relate to such
fractional share interests; and such fractional share interests will not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of WAL.
In lieu of any such fractional shares of WAL Common Stock, each Holder of a
Bridge Stock Certificate who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fractional share interest in exchange for such Bridge Stock Certificate shall
receive from the Exchange Agent an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which such Holder
(after taking into account all shares of Bridge Common Stock held by such
holder at the Effective Time) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Closing
WAL Share Value. Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this
Agreement, funds utilized to acquire fractional shares as aforesaid shall be
furnished by WAL on a timely basis and shall in no event be derived from or
diminish the Cash Consideration available for distribution as part of the
Merger Consideration. For U.S. federal income tax 

 



6  purposes, the amount of any cash consideration paid pursuant to this Section
2.1(j) in lieu of issuing fractional shares of WAL Common Stock shall be
treated as though such fractional share interests were first delivered to
affected Holders and then redeemed.

(k) WAL, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right
to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (A) the issuance and delivery of WAL Stock Certificates or book
entry shares of WAL Common Stock into which shares of Bridge Common Stock
are converted in the Merger, and (B) the method of payment of cash for shares
of Bridge Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of WAL Common Stock.

 

2.2 Certain Adjustments. If, after the date hereof and on or prior to the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of WAL Common Stock shall be changed
into a different number of shares by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization or combination, stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend or rights issued in respect of such stock, or any similar event shall
occur (any such action, a "WAL Adjustment Event"), the Exchange Ratio shall
be proportionately adjusted to provide to the Holders the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such WAL Adjustment Event.

 

2.3 Appraisal Rights; Dissenters Shares.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary and to the
extent available under the CCC, all shares of Bridge Common Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
shareholders of Bridge who have neither voted in favor of the Merger nor
consented thereto in writing and who have demanded properly in writing
appraisal for such shares of Bridge Common Stock in accordance with Section
1301 of the CCC (collectively, the "Dissenters Shares") shall not be
converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration.
Such shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of Dissenters Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1300 et seq. of the CCC, except that all Dissenters Shares held by
shareholders of Bridge who have failed to perfect or who effectively have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenters Shares under
the CCC shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have
become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender, in the
manner provided in Section 1.4(a).

 

(b) Bridge shall give WAL (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
received by Bridge, withdrawals of such demands and any other similar
instruments served pursuant to the CCC and received by Bridge, and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands
for appraisal under the CCC. Bridge shall not, except with the prior
written consent of WAL, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands or waive any failure
to timely deliver a demand, subject to Bridges legal duties and obligations
under the CCC.

any Bridge Subsidiary or event which with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice, or both, would constitute a material default by Bridge or any Bridge

its Subsidiaries that qualifies as a "financial institution" under the U.S.
Anti-Money Laundering Laws, has Knowingly acted, by itself or in conjunction
with another, in any act in connection with the concealment of any currency,
securities, other proprietary interest that is the result of a felony as
defined in the U.S. Anti-Money Laundering Laws ("Unlawful Gains"), nor
Knowingly accepted, transported, stored, dealt in or brokered any sale,
purchase or any transaction of any other nature for Unlawful Gains. Bridge and
each of its Subsidiaries that qualifies as a "financial institution" under the
U.S. Anti-Money Laundering Laws have, during the past three (3) years,
implemented such anti-money laundering mechanisms and kept and filed all
material reports and other necessary material documents as required by, and
otherwise complied in all material respects with, the U.S. Anti-Money
Laundering Laws and the rules and regulations issued thereunder.

(g) Since January 1, 2013, Bridge and each of its Subsidiaries has properly
administered all accounts for which it acts as a fiduciary, including accounts
for which it serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator or investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of
the governing documents and applicable Law, except where the failure to so
administer such accounts would not reasonably be expect to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bridge. None of Bridge, any
of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of Bridge, any director, officer or
employee of Bridge or of any of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of
trust or fiduciary duty with respect to any such fiduciary account that would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Bridge, and, except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Bridge,
the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct and
accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

(h) Each of Bridge and Bridge Bank is an approved "lender," "certified
lender" or "preferred lender" as the case may be, under and pursuant to the
loan guarantee programs of the United States Small Business Administration
(the "SBA") and the Export-Import Bank of the United States ("Ex-Im"). Bridge
and Bridge Bank have at all times complied, in all material respects, with the
rules and regulations of the loan and loan guarantee programs of the SBA and
Ex-Im. All loans originated by Bridge and Bridge Bank pursuant to or
guaranteed by either the SBA or Ex-Im were made pursuant to all applicable SBA
or Ex-Im (as the case may be) rules and regulations and met all applicable
underwriting criteria necessary to qualify for the loan or loan guarantee
programs of the SBA or Ex-Im (as the case may be). All loans made or
originated by Bridge and Bridge Bank under or pursuant to loan or loan
programs of the SBA or Ex-Im have been made on standard loan

3.19 Loans.

 

(a) As of the date hereof and except as set forth in Section 3.19(a) of the
Bridge Disclosure Schedule, neither Bridge nor any Bridge Subsidiary is a
party to any written or oral loan in which Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary is
a creditor which as of December 31, 2014 had an outstanding balance of
$500,000 or more and

 



19  under the terms of which the obligor was, as of December 31, 2014, over 90
days or more delinquent in payment of principal or interest. Except as such
disclosure may be limited by any applicable Law, rule or regulation, Section
3.19(a) of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of all of the loans of Bridge and its Subsidiaries that, as of
December 31, 2014, had an outstanding balance of $500,000 or more and were
classified by Bridge as "Other Loans Specially Mentioned," "Special Mention,"
"Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," "Classified," "Criticized," "Credit Risk
Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words of similar import
("Classified Loans"), together with the principal amount of and accrued and
unpaid interest on each such loan and the aggregate principal amount of and
accrued and unpaid interest on such loans as of such date. All loans owned as
of the date hereof by Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary, or in which Bridge or
any Bridge Subsidiary has an interest, comply in all material respects with
all Laws and regulations thereunder. As of the date hereof, all loans owned by
Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary, or in which Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary
has an interest, have been made or acquired by Bridge in accordance with
board of director-approved loan policies. Section 3.19(a) of the Bridge
Disclosure Schedule includes a true and correct list of each outstanding loan
owned as of the date hereof by Bridge and made for an amount equal to $500,000
or more which was made or acquired by Bridge pursuant to an exception from
board of director-approved loan policies approved by Bridges board of
directors.

 

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or in
the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Bridge, each loan
of Bridge and any Bridge Subsidiary outstanding as of the date hereof (i) is
evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness that are
true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent carried on the
books and records of Bridge and the Bridge Subsidiaries as secured loans, has
been secured by valid liens, which have been perfected and (iii) is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the obligor named therein, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, moratorium, reorganization or
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting insured
depository institutions or the rights of creditors generally and subject to
general principles of equity). Each of Bridge and each Bridge Subsidiary holds
mortgages contained in its loan portfolio for its own benefit to the extent of
its interest shown therein; such mortgages evidence liens having the priority
indicated by the terms of such mortgages, including the associated loan
documents, subject, as of the date of recordation or filing of applicable
security instruments, only to such exceptions as are discussed in attorneys
opinions regarding title or in title insurance policies in the mortgage files
relating to the loans secured by real property or are not material as to the
collectability of such loans; and all loans owned by Bridge and each
Bridge Subsidiary are with full recourse to the borrowers, and each of Bridge
and any Bridge Subsidiary has taken no action which would result in a waiver
or negation of any rights or remedies available against the borrower or
guarantor, if any, on any loan (except as set forth at Section 3.19(b) of the
Bridge Disclosure Schedule). Schedule 3.19(b) includes a true and correct list
of each loan owned by Bridge outstanding as of the date hereof and made for an
amount equal to $500,000 or more for which Bridge has taken action which has
resulted, or would result, in a waiver or negation of any rights or remedies
available against the borrower or guarantor, if any, on such loans. Bridge and
each Bridge Subsidiary have properly perfected or caused to be properly
perfected all security interests, liens, or other interests in any collateral
securing any loans made by it. True, correct and complete copies of loan
delinquency reports as of December 31, 2014 prepared by Bridge, which reports
include all loans delinquent or otherwise in default, have been made available
to WAL. True, correct and complete copies of the currently effective lending
policies and practices of Bridge and each Bridge Subsidiary also have been
made available to WAL.

(c) Each outstanding loan of Bridge and any Bridge Subsidiary (including loans
held for resale to investors) solicited and originated, is and has been
administered and, where applicable, serviced, and the relevant loan files are
being maintained, in all material respects, in accordance with the relevant
notes or other credit or security documents, the applicable written
underwriting standards of Bridge and any Bridge Subsidiary (and, in the case
of loans held for resale to investors, the applicable underwriting standards,
if any, of the applicable investors) and all applicable Laws, regulations and
rules. 

(d) None of the agreements pursuant to which Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary
has sold loans or pools of loans or participations in loans or pools of loans
contains any obligation to repurchase such loans or interests therein solely
on account of a payment default by the obligor on any such loan. All loans
purchased or originated by Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary and
subsequently sold by Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary have been sold without
any liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation. Each
outstanding loan participation sold by Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary was
sold with the risk of non-payment of all or any portion of that underlying
loan to be shared by each participant (including Bridge or any Bridge
Subsidiary) proportionately to the

 



20  share of such loan represented by such participation without any recourse of
such other lender or participant to Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary for
payment or repurchase of the amount of such loan represented by the
participation or liability under any yield maintenance or similar obligation.
Each of Bridge and any Bridge Subsidiary have properly fulfilled in all
material respects its respective contractual responsibilities and respective
duties in any loan in which it acts as the lead lender or servicer and has
complied in all material respects with its duties as required under applicable
regulatory requirements.

 

(e) Section 3.19(e) of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all
loans outstanding as of the date hereof and made by Bridge or any Bridge
Subsidiary to any "executive officer" or other "insider" (as each such term is
defined in Regulation O (12 C.F.R. §215.2(h)) promulgated by the Federal
Reserve Board) of Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary.

 

(f) Neither Bridge nor any Bridge Subsidiary is now, nor has it ever been
since December 31, 2012, subject to any material fine, suspension, settlement

reduction in any loan purchase commitment from, any Governmental Entity or
Regulatory Agency relating to the origination, sale or servicing of
mortgage or consumer loans.

ARTICLE VI

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

6.1 Regulatory Matters.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, but not
later than forty-five (45) days thereafter, WAL and Bridge shall cooperate in
preparing and each shall cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable
Proxy Materials which shall constitute the proxy statement-prospectus relating
to the matters submitted to the Bridge shareholders at the Special
Meeting and WAL shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration
Statement. The proxy statement-prospectus will be included as a prospectus in
and will constitute a part of the Registration Statement as WALs prospectus.
WAL shall use reasonable best efforts, and Bridge shall cooperate with WAL,
to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep
the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. WAL and Bridge shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies
of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments, with
respect to the Registration Statement received from the SEC. The parties
shall cooperate and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Materials and the
Registration Statement prior to its filing with the SEC, and will provide
each other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding
any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement
(including by incorporation by reference) of the Proxy Materials or the
Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of both parties,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ that
with respect to documents filed by a party which are incorporated by reference
in the Registration Statement or Proxy Materials, this right of approval
shall apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or
its business, financial condition or results of operations. WAL will use
reasonable best efforts to allow Bridge to cause the Proxy Materials to be
mailed to Bridge shareholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each
party will advise the other party, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification of the WAL
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Registration
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to WAL or Bridge, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by WAL or Bridge, which should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Materials so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by
law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
shareholders of Bridge.

 



31 (b) The information regarding Bridge and its Subsidiaries to be supplied by
Bridge for inclusion in the Registration Statement will not, at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. In connection with
the preparation of the Registration Statement, Bridge shall receive a written
opinion from Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, counsel to Bridge, dated as
of the date on which the Registration Statement is declared effective, to the
effect that the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a)
of the Code. Such counsel shall be entitled to rely upon representation
letters from each of WAL, Bridge and others, in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to such counsel. Each such representation
letter shall be dated as of the date of such opinion.

 

(c) The information regarding WAL and its Subsidiaries to be supplied by WAL
for inclusion in the Registration Statement will not, at the time the
Registration Statement becomes effective, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. In connection with
the preparation of the Registration Statement, WAL shall receive a written
opinion from Hogan Lovells US LLP, counsel to WAL, dated as of the date on
which the Registration Statement is declared effective, to the effect that
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.
Such counsel shall be entitled to rely upon representation letters from each
of Bridge, WAL and others, in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such counsel. Each such representation letter shall be dated
as of the date of such opinion.

(d) WAL also shall take any action (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general
consent to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the Merger and each of Bridge and WAL
shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its Common
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, WAL shall use its reasonable best efforts to
list on the New York Stock Exchange the additional shares of WAL Common Stock
to be issued by WAL in exchange for the shares of Bridge Common Stock.

(f) WAL and Bridge will prepare and file all necessary documentation, to
effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all Requisite Regulatory Approvals. Any initial filing
with the Governmental Entities shall be made by WAL as soon as
reasonably practicable after the execution hereof, but, provided that Bridge
has cooperated as described herein, in no event later than forty-five (45)
days after the date hereof for the Bank Merger Application required by the
FRB. WAL and Bridge shall cooperate with each other to effect the foregoing.
Bridge and WAL shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
Bridge or WAL, as the case may be, which appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will
keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to contemplation of
the transactions contemplated herein.

(g) WAL and Bridge shall promptly advise each other upon receiving any
communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is
required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed.

(h) The Board of Directors of Bridge or a committee of Non-Employee
Directors thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act) shall adopt a resolution in advance of the Effective
Time providing that the disposition by the officers and directors of Bridge of
Bridge Common Stock, options to acquire Bridge Stock, Bridge Restricted Stock
or Bridge Restricted Stock Units or other equity securities

 



32  of Bridge pursuant to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3
under the Exchange Act.

 

6.2 Access to Information.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, Bridge shall accord to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of WAL, access, during normal
business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such period,
Bridge shall make available to WAL (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities laws or federal or
state banking laws unless prohibited by applicable Law or regulation, and
(ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and personnel
as WAL may reasonably request. WAL will hold all such information in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

(b) No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective representatives shall relieve any other party from any breach or
violation of this Agreement and shall not have any effect for the purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII or
compliance by Bridge with the covenants set forth in Section 5.1.

(c) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or regulation, Bridge shall provide
WAL with true, correct and complete copies of all financial and other
information provided to directors of Bridge in connection with meetings of
their Boards of Directors or committees thereof; _provided, however_ , that,
except as may be expressly required pursuant to the other terms of this
Agreement, Bridge shall be under no obligation hereunder to deliver copies of,
or otherwise make available to WAL, any information pertaining to the
deliberations of the Bridge Board of Directors involving the transactions
contemplated hereby (except that Bridge shall provide WAL with access to the
board resolutions of Bridge approving the transactions contemplated hereby).

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Bridge shall
not be required to deliver to WAL any reports filed by Bridge with the SEC
for which WAL may obtain a copy through the SECs EDGAR filing system.

6.3 Shareholder Meeting.

 

(a) Bridge shall duly take all lawful action necessary to call, give notice
of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as promptly as practicable
and in any event no later than 45 days following the date upon which the
Registration Statement becomes effective (the "Special Meeting") for the
purpose of voting upon the approval of this Agreement and, unless the Bridge
Board of Directors has effected a Change in Bridge Recommendation in
accordance with Section 6.3(b), shall use its reasonable best efforts to
solicit proxies for the adoption of this Agreement by such shareholders;
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall prevent Bridge from postponing or
adjourning the Special Meeting if (x) a quorum is not present at the Special
Meeting and Bridge during the period of such postponement or adjournment is
using its reasonable best efforts to obtain a quorum, (y) Bridge is so
required by applicable Laws, or (z) Bridges Board of Directors shall have
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
it is necessary to postpone or adjourn the Special Meeting, including in
order to give shareholders of Bridge sufficient time to evaluate any
information or disclosure that Bridge has sent to its shareholders or
otherwise made available to its shareholders. The Board of Directors of
Bridge shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of
Bridge (the "Bridge Recommendation") in the Proxy Materials and shall not
directly or indirectly withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
WAL such recommendation (any such action being referred to as a "Change in
Bridge Recommendation"), except as and to the extent expressly permitted by
Section 6.3(b). Notwithstanding any Change in Bridge Recommendation, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms (including
pursuant to Section 8.1(e) hereof) prior to the Special Meeting, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of Bridge at the Special
Meeting for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Bridge of such obligation;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board of Directors of Bridge shall have
effected a Change in Bridge Recommendation, then the Board of Directors of
Bridge may submit this Agreement to Bridges shareholders with a neutral or
negative recommendation (although the resolutions adopting this Agreement as
of the 

 



33  date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Bridge may communicate the basis for such recommendation to
Bridges shareholders in the Proxy Materials and the Registration Statement
or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto or other document to the
extent required by applicable Law.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the date of the Special Meeting,
Bridge and its Board of Directors shall be permitted to effect a Change in
Bridge Recommendation if and only to the extent that:

(i) its Board of Directors, after consultation with its outside
counsel, determines in good faith that failure to take such action would or
would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, and

 

(ii) if Bridges Board of Directors intends to effect a Change in Bridge
Recommendation following and as a result of a Competing Proposal, it has
complied in all material respects with Section 6.12, and:

(A) such Competing Proposal did not result from any solicitation in violation
of Section 6.12 and Bridges Board of Directors has concluded in good faith
that such Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior Competing Transaction
after considering all of the amendments and adjustments offered by WAL
pursuant to clause (C) below in a manner that would form a binding contract if
accepted by Bridge,

(B) Bridge has notified WAL in writing, at least three (3) Business Days in
advance, of its intention to effect a Change in Bridge Recommendation (such
three-day period, the "Notice Period"), specifying the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Competing Transaction (including the identity
of the party making such Superior Competing Transaction) and furnishing to WAL
a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Competing Transaction, and all other material documents, and

(C) during the Notice Period, and in any event, prior to effecting such a
Change in Bridge Recommendation, Bridge has negotiated, and has caused its
financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with WAL in good faith (to the
extent WAL desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Competing Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Competing Transaction.

In the event of any material revisions to the Superior Competing Transaction,
Bridge shall be required to deliver a new written notice to WAL and to again
comply with the requirements of this Section 6.3(b) with respect to such new
written notice, except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to two (2)
Business Days. 

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger; Third Party Consents. Each of WAL and Bridge
shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with
all legal requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to the
Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other party to obtain) any consent, authorization,
or approval of any third party non-Governmental Entity, or any waiver
thereof, as may be required to be obtained (i) by Bridge under any Bridge
Contract or (ii) by WAL under any material contract for which WAL is a party,
in each case, in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Employees.

 

(a) To the extent permissible under the applicable provisions of the Code and
ERISA, for purposes of crediting periods of service for eligibility and
vesting, but not for benefit accrual purposes, under employee pension benefit
plans (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2), other than the Bridge Bank,
National Association Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan (the "SERP")) and
employee welfare plans (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(1)) maintained
by WAL or WAB, as applicable, and for purposes of all vacation, paid time off
and similar plans, policies, practices maintained by WAL or WAB, as
applicable, and for purposes of crediting periods of service for eligibility,
vesting and benefit accrual under the agreements that constitute the SERP

 



34  and any severance plan, policy or practice maintained by WAL or WAB, as
applicable, individuals who are employees of Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary
at the Effective Time and who become eligible to participate in such plans
will be credited with periods of service with Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary
(or with any predecessor to Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary, to the extent
such service is credited for such purposes under the corresponding Plan)
before the Effective Time as if such service had been with WAL or WAB, as
applicable; provided, however, no such individuals will participate in any
severance plan, policy or practice maintained by WAL or WAB, as applicable,
until the expiration of the twelve (12) month period following the Effective
Time during which time severance will be provided pursuant to Section 6.5(e)
hereof.

 

(b) Effective no later than the last day of the regularly scheduled payroll
period immediately preceding the Closing Date, Bridge and each Bridge
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall freeze contributions to any Code Section
401(a) plan that it sponsors or contributes to (a "401(a) Plan"). Effective no
later than the day before the Closing Date, Bridge and each
Bridge Subsidiary, as applicable, shall terminate any 401(a) Plan by proper
Board action. Before the Closing Date, Bridge and each Bridge Subsidiary, as
applicable, shall provide to WAL (i) copies of duly adopted resolutions
terminating the 401(a) Plan, and (ii) an executed amendment to the 401(a)
Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements of the
Code and regulations thereunder. The resolution and amendment shall be subject
to the prior review and approval of WAL, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld. At the request of the WAL, Bridge and each Bridge
Subsidiary, as applicable, shall terminate any and all other Plans, including
any group health, dental, severance, separation or salary continuation plans,
programs or arrangements, effective either immediately before the Closing Date
or thereafter as specified by WAL. Effective as of the Closing Date, WAL shall
have in effect or shall cause WAB to provide a defined contribution plan that
is qualified under Code Section 401(a) and that includes a qualified cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Code Section 401(k), in which
employees of Bridge and any Bridge Subsidiary shall, within sixty (60) days
of the Closing, be eligible to participate.

(c) Through December 31, 2015, WAL shall or shall cause WAB to provide to all
individuals who are employees of Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time (i) salary or wage levels at least equal to the salary or wage
levels to which such individuals were entitled immediately prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) incentive plan opportunities at least equal to the
incentive plan opportunities to which such individuals were entitled as of the
date hereof. Except to the extent that WAL or its Subsidiaries continue Plans
in effect or as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including
pursuant to the preceding sentence), employees of Bridge or any of the Bridge
Subsidiaries who become employed by WAL or any of the WAL Subsidiaries will be
eligible for employee benefits (including, without limitation, incentive and
equity-based compensation) at least as favorable as the employee benefits that
WAL or such WAL Subsidiary, as the case may be, provides to its similarly
situated employees and, except as otherwise required by this Agreement, on
substantially the same basis as is applicable to such similarly situated
employees, _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall require any
duplication of benefits. If WAL or any of its Subsidiaries determines to
discontinue a Plan in effect prior to December 31, 2015, then to the extent
permitted under applicable Law and WALs group health, life insurance and
disability plans, and paid time off plans, WAL will or will cause WAB to give
credit to employees of Bridge and Bridge Subsidiaries, with respect to the
satisfaction of 2015 plan year (x) deductibles, (y) co-payments, (z)
coinsurance requirements, (aa) maximum out-of-pocket provisions and (bb)
similar limitations on coverage that are applicable under such plans of WAL
or WAB, equal to the credit that any such employee had received as of the
Effective Time towards the satisfaction of any such limitations under the
comparable plans of Bridge or Bridge Subsidiaries and to waive preexisting
condition limitations, evidence of insurability requirements and waiting
periods for participation and coverage to the same extent waived under the
corresponding Plan. WAL shall be solely responsible for compliance with the
requirements of Code Section 4980B and part 6 of subtitle B of title I of
ERISA ("COBRA"), including, without limitation, the provision of "continuation
coverage" (within the meaning of COBRA) with respect to all employees of
Bridge and any Bridge Subsidiary and their spouses and dependents for whom a
"qualifying event" (within the meaning of COBRA) occurs on or after the
Closing Date.

 

(d) After the Effective Time and through December 31, 2015, WAL and each
relevant WAL Subsidiary will honor and perform the obligations of Bridge
under the incentive contracts, plans and arrangements listed in Section
6.5(d)(1) of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with the terms in
effect under such contracts, plans and arrangements as of the Effective Time,
subject to any required regulatory approval or satisfaction of a condition in
any regulatory approval necessary for such action (with WAL and each relevant
WAL Subsidiary taking commercially reasonable efforts acting in good faith to
obtain any such regulatory approvals

 



35  and/or satisfy any such regulatory conditions). After the Effective Time,
WAL and each relevant WAL Subsidiary will honor and perform the obligations of
Bridge under the contracts, plans and arrangements listed in Section
6.5(d)(2) of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule, in accordance with the terms in
effect under such contracts, plans and arrangements as of the Effective Time
(other than any requirement of separation from service pursuant to such
agreements and arrangements as are identified on Section 6.5(d)(2) of the
Bridge Disclosure Schedule as providing for payment of a severance benefit),
subject to any required regulatory approval or satisfaction of a condition in
any regulatory approval necessary for such action (with WAL and each relevant
WAL Subsidiary taking commercially reasonable efforts acting in good faith to
obtain any such regulatory approvals and/or satisfy any such regulatory
conditions), except to the extent that any such agreements if permitted by
the terms thereof shall be superseded or terminated at the Closing Date or
following the Closing Date. Except for the contracts, plans and arrangements
described in the preceding sentences, the 401(a) Plan that shall be
terminated prior to Closing, and as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
subject to and following the occurrence of the Effective Time, the Plans of
Bridge and any Subsidiary of Bridge shall, in the sole and absolute
discretion of WAL, be frozen, terminated or merged into comparable plans of
WAL or any relevant Subsidiary of WAL, effective at such time as WAL shall
determine in its sole and absolute discretion.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, WAL and each relevant WAL Subsidiary will
provide a severance benefit to each full-time employee of Bridge or
any Bridge Subsidiary immediately before the Effective Time (except to the
extent that any such employee who is a party to any written agreement relating
to employment or severance described in Section 3.12(a) hereof or retention or
severance plan described in Section 3.11(a) of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule
is entitled to a severance benefit or retention benefit in lieu thereof) and
whose employment is terminated involuntarily, other than for "Cause" (as
defined below), by WAL or such WAL Subsidiary as of the Effective Time or
within twelve (12) months thereafter. The severance benefit shall consist of a
lump sum payment equal to such employees regularly scheduled base salary or
base wages at the time of termination of employment for a period equal to (i)
two weeks multiplied by (ii) the number of full years of continuous service
completed by such employee with Bridge or any Bridge Subsidiary, up to a
maximum of 15 weeks, subject to applicable tax withholding, and shall be the
only severance benefit available to such employees. For purposes of this
Section 6.5(e), "Cause" shall mean the employees personal dishonesty, willful
misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, failure to
comply with any valid and legal directive of WAL, failure to perform stated
duties, violation of any law, rule or regulation (other than traffic
violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order. After the
Effective Time, WAL and each relevant WAL Subsidiary will honor and perform
the obligations of Bridge under any written agreement relating to employment
or severance described in Section 3.12(a) hereof or retention or
severance plan described in Section 3.11(a) of the Bridge Disclosure
Schedule.

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in the agreements set forth in
Sections 6.5(d) and 3.11 of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule or in this
Agreement, no payment shall be made under any Plan that would constitute a
"parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Code Section 280G), and to
the extent that any such payment would constitute a "parachute payment," the
payment will be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid it being considered a
"parachute payment." Bridge and any relevant Subsidiary of Bridge will
take any and all needed corporate action including any required plan
amendments in order to effect the foregoing.

6.6 Indemnification. 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, in which any
Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer
or employee of Bridge or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties")
is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is
or was a director, officer or employee of Bridge or its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and all actions taken by an Indemnified Party
in connection herewith, in each case in such Indemnified Partys capacity as
a director, officer or employee of Bridge or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the
parties hereto agree to cooperate and defend against and respond thereto to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Bridge and the applicable Bridge Subsidiaries as
in effect on the date hereof and indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date hereof with any directors, officers and employees of
Bridge and its Subsidiaries. It is

 



36  understood and agreed that from and after the Effective Time, WAL shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each such Indemnified Party against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation to the same extent
such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as
of the date of this Agreement by Bridge and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to applicable Laws, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Bridge and
the applicable Bridge Subsidiaries as in effect on the date hereof and
indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date hereof with any
directors, officers and employees of Bridge and its Subsidiaries. In the
event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
WAL; _provided, however_ , that (1) WAL shall have the right to assume and
control the defense thereof and upon such assumption the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate with WAL in such defense and WAL shall not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if WAL elects not to assume such defense
or counsel for the Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified
Parties that there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between WAL
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
reasonably satisfactory to WAL, and WAL shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) WAL shall be
obligated pursuant to this Section 6.6(a) to pay for only one firm of counsel
for each Indemnified Party, (3) WAL shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (4) WAL shall not be obligated pursuant
to this Section 6.6(a) to the extent that a final non-appealable judgment
determines that an Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder for any such losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses,
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement. Upon the request of
an Indemnified Party, WAL shall be obligated to advance expenses incurred in
connection with a threatened or pending action, suit or preceding in advance
of final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, unless WAL is
prohibited from doing so by applicable Law; _provided_ that the Indemnified
Party provides an undertaking to repay such amount if it is determined that
such party is not entitled to be indemnified by WAL. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6(a), upon learning of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify WAL
thereof; _provided, however_ , that the failure to so notify shall not affect
the obligations of WAL under this Section 6.6(a) except to the extent such
failure to notify materially prejudices WAL. WALs obligations under this
Section 6.6(a) continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that all rights to
indemnification in respect of any claim asserted or made within such period
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim. WAL shall require
any successor to expressly assume its obligations under this Section 6.6(a).

__(b) WAL shall purchase an extended reporting period endorsement or a "tail"
policy for the benefit of the persons currently or formerly serving as
officers and directors of Bridge who are, as of the date of this Agreement,
individually covered by a directors  and officers liability
insurance policy, covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time which were committed by such officers and directors in their
capacity as such, which shall provide such directors and officers liability
insurance coverage for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years
following the Effective Time, on terms with respect to such coverage, and in
an aggregate amount, not less favorable to such individuals than those of such
policy in effect on the date hereof; _provided however, _that in no event
shall WAL be required to expend, in the aggregate, an amount equal to more
than 200% of the current annual premiums expended by Bridge to maintain or
procure such coverage. In connection with the foregoing, Bridge agrees to
provide such insurer or substitute insurer with such representations as such
insurer may reasonably request with respect to the reporting of any prior
claims. __

 

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by
contract or otherwise.

 

6.7 Subsequent Interim and Annual Financial Statements. As soon as reasonably
practicable after they become available, but in no event more than 30 days
after the end of each calendar month ending after the date hereof, Bridge
shall furnish to WAL (a) consolidated and consolidating financial statements
(including balance sheets, statements of operations and shareholders equity)
of Bridge and its Subsidiaries as of and

 



37  for such month then ended, (b) internal management financial control reports
showing actual financial performance against plan and previous period, and (c)
any reports provided to the Board of Directors of Bridge or any committee
thereof relating to the financial performance and risk management of Bridge.
In addition, Bridge shall furnish WAL with a copy of each report filed by
Bridge or any of its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Entity within three (3)
Business Days following the filing thereof. All information furnished by
Bridge to WAL pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be held in confidence to the
same extent of WALs obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.

6.8 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, or to vest the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving Bank with
full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, or the constituent banks to
the Bank Merger, as the case may be, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and WALs and Bridges Subsidiaries shall take all
such necessary action as may be reasonably requested by WAL or Bridge, as the
case may be.

6.9 Advice of Changes. WAL and Bridge shall promptly advise the other party of
any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has or would be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its respective representations,
warranties or covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the
Effective Time, each party will promptly supplement or amend its disclosure
schedule delivered in connection with the execution of this Agreement to
reflect any matter which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
disclosure schedule or which is necessary to correct any information in such
disclosure schedule which has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement
or amendment to such disclosure schedule shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections
7.2(a) or 7.3(a), as the case may be, or the compliance by Bridge with the
covenants set forth in Section 5.1. 

6.10 Current Information. During the period from the date of this Agreement to
the Effective Time, Bridge will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular and frequent basis (not less than
monthly) with representatives of WAL and to report the general status of the
ongoing operations of Bridge. Bridge will promptly notify WAL of any material
change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties
of Bridge and of any complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that the same may be contemplated) of any Governmental Entity, or
the institution or the threat of litigation involving Bridge, and will keep
WAL fully informed of such events.

6.11 Transaction Expenses of Bridge.

(a) Bridge has provided at Section 6.11(a) of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule
its estimated budget of transaction-related expenses reasonably anticipated
to be payable by Bridge in connection with this transaction, including the
fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers and other
professionals.

 

(b) Bridge shall promptly advise WAL if Bridge anticipates exceeding the
estimated budget of transaction-related expenses set forth in Section 6.11(a)
of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule, or any subsequent adjustment thereof.

(c) Promptly after the execution of this Agreement, Bridge shall ask all of
its attorneys and other professionals to render current and correct invoices
for all unbilled time and disbursements. Bridge shall accrue and/or pay all of
such amounts which are actually due and owing as soon as possible.

(d) Bridge, in reasonable consultation with WAL, shall make all arrangements
with respect to the printing and mailing of the Proxy Materials. Bridge
shall, if WAL reasonably deems necessary, also engage a proxy solicitation
firm to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. Bridge
agrees to cooperate as to such matters.

 

6.12 Acquisition Proposals.

 



38 (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the date on
which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article VIII, Bridge
shall not, directly or indirectly, and will instruct its officers, directors
and executive employees and its accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
investment bankers, financial advisors, agents and other representatives
(collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:

(i) initiate, solicit, encourage or Knowingly facilitate (including by way of
providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers
(whether firm or hypothetical) relating to or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Competing Proposal,

(ii) have any discussions with or provide any confidential information or data
to any Person relating to a Competing Proposal, or engage in any negotiations
concerning a Competing Proposal (other than discussions or requests for and
receipt of information to ascertain the terms of any such Competing Proposal),

 

(iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any
Competing Proposal,

 

(iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, asset or share purchase or
share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating
to any Competing Proposal,

 

(v) enter into any agreement or agreement in principle requiring, directly or
indirectly, Bridge to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder, or

(vi) publicly propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Bridge receives a _bona fide
_written Competing Proposal after the date hereof that did not result from
solicitation which is in violation of this Section 6.12 and the Board of
Directors of Bridge, after consultation with independent legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such Competing Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Competing Transaction, Bridge may,
and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, prior to
(but not after) the date of the Special Meeting, take any or all action
described in clauses (i) and (ii) above if the Board of Directors of Bridge
concludes in good faith (after receiving the advice of its outside counsel)
that failure to take such actions would or would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to providing any confidential information
or data to such Person, Bridge shall have received from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable to Bridge in
any material respect than those contained in the Mutual Confidentiality
Agreement by and between WAL and Bridge, dated as of August 1, 2014 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), and shall contemporaneously provide to WAL any
non-public information concerning Bridge or its Subsidiaries to be provided to
such Person which was not previously provided to WAL (or its Representatives);

 

(b) Bridge shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions
or negotiations conducted before the date hereof with any third parties other
than WAL with respect to any Competing Proposal, will use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar
agreement relating to a Competing Proposal, including by instructing the
other parties thereto to promptly return or destroy any confidential
information previously furnished by or on behalf of Bridge thereunder, and
will not waive or amend any provision of any such agreement. Bridge will
promptly (and in all events within 24 hours) following receipt of any
Competing Proposal or any inquiry which would reasonably be expected to lead
to a Competing Proposal advise WAL of the material terms thereof (including
the identity of the Person making such Competing Proposal), and will keep WAL
reasonably apprised of any related discussions and negotiations with the
Person making such Competing Proposal and the status and terms thereof
(including providing WAL with a copy of all material documentation and
correspondence with the Person making such Competing Proposal relating
thereto) on a current basis. Without limiting the foregoing, Bridge shall
notify WAL orally and in writing within 24 hours after it enters into
discussions or negotiations with another Person regarding a Competing
Proposal or executes and delivers a confidentiality agreement with another
Person in connection with a Competing Proposal.

 



39 (c) Nothing contained herein shall prevent Bridge from complying with Rule
14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act with
respect to a Competing Proposal; _provided_ , that such Rules will in no way
eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would
otherwise have under this Agreement; and _provided, further_ , that any such
disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be a Change in Bridge Recommendation unless the Board of Directors of
Bridge expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Bridge Recommendation.

6.13 Takeover Laws. Bridge and its Board of Directors shall (i) use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that no state takeover Law or similar Law or
any takeover-related provision in Bridges certificate of incorporation or
bylaws is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) if any state
takeover Law or similar Law or any takeover-related provision in Bridges
certificate of incorporation or bylaws becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

6.14 Shareholder Litigation. Bridge shall give WAL the opportunity to
participate, at WALs expense, in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder litigation against Bridge and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without WALs prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).

6.15 Confidentiality Agreement. WAL and Bridge shall comply with, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their
respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms set
forth therein.

and agreements of such party set forth herein;

 

(c) by either WAL or Bridge if the Merger shall not have been consummated on
or before December 31, 2015, unless the failure of the Closing to occur by

forth herein;

 

(d) by either WAL or Bridge (provided that the terminating party is not in
breach of its obligations under Section 6.3) if the approval of the

the Superior Competing Transaction would or would be reasonably likely to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; and (iv)
Bridge, prior to termination of this Agreement, pays to WAL in
immediately available funds, any amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Section 9.3 hereof;

(f) by either WAL or Bridge (provided that the terminating party is not then

contained herein that, individually or in the aggregate, would give the other
party the right to terminate this Agreement) if there shall have been a
breach of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement
on the part of the other party, if such breach, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
breaching party, and such breach is not curable or shall not have been cured
within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of
such breach from the other party hereto or such breach, by its nature, cannot
be cured prior to the Closing;

 

(g) by either WAL or Bridge (provided that the terminating party is not then

party the right to terminate this Agreement) if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party, and such breach is not curable or
shall not have been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching
party of written notice of such breach from the other party hereto or such
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing; and

reason, (i) fails to use its reasonable best efforts to call and hold within
45 days of the effective date of the Registration Statement a special meeting
of Bridges shareholders to consider and approve this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (except as provided in Section 6.3(a)) or
(ii) fails to recommend to shareholders the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either WAL or Bridge as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall

survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party shall be relieved or
released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful or
intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement.

 

8.3 Amendment. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Board of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the shareholders of Bridge;
_provided, however_ , that after any approval of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Bridges shareholders, there may not be,
without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement
which reduces the amount or changes the form of the consideration to
be delivered to Bridge shareholders hereunder other than as contemplated by
this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and

strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall
not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or
other failure.

_Surviving Corporation_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants
and agreements herein set forth and for the purpose of prescribing the terms
and conditions of such Merger, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_THE MERGER_

 

Upon consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time (as defined in Article
VIII hereof), Bridge shall be merged with and into WAL, which shall thereupon
be the Surviving Corporation, and the separate corporate existence of Bridge
shall cease.

ARTICLE II

 

 _NAME_

The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Western Alliance
Bancorporation". ARTICLE III

 

 _CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION_

 

The Certificate of Incorporation of WAL as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at and after the Effective Time, continue to be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE IV

 

 _BYLAWS_

The Bylaws of WAL as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
at and after the Effective Time, continue to be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

ARTICLE V

_RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF SURVIVING CORPORATION_

At and after the Effective Time, all rights, privileges, powers and franchises
and all property and assets of every kind and description of WAL and Bridge
shall be vested in and be held and enjoyed by the Surviving Corporation,
without further act or deed, and all the estates and interests of every kind
of WAL and Bridge, including all debts due to either of them, shall be as

WAL or Bridge shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the

Bridge shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
WAL and Bridge shall be debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said
debts, liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.

ARTICLE VI

 

 _CONVERSION OF SHARES_

In and by virtue of the Merger and at the Effective Time, pursuant to this
Agreement of Merger, the shares of WAL Common Stock and Bridge Common Stock
outstanding at the Effective Time shall be converted as follows:

 

(a) _Effect on WAL Common Stock_. Each share of WAL Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, on and after the
Effective Time, remain outstanding and shall automatically and for all
purposes be deemed to represent one share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Stock_ ").

 

(b) _Effect on Bridge Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, each share of
Bridge Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
(excluding dissenters shares and all unvested shares of Bridge restricted
stock but, for the avoidance of doubt, including any associated rights to
purchase capital stock of Bridge issued pursuant to that certain Rights
Agreement, dated as of August 21, 2008, between Bridge and American Stock
Transfer and Trust Company, LLC, as rights agent, and any shares of Bridge
Common Stock issued as of the Effective Time by reason of the exercise of
options to acquire Bridge Common Stock) shall be converted into the right to
receive, without interest, (i) 0.8145 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of

 



2  WAL Common Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") and (ii) $2.39 in cash (the
" _Cash Consideration_ ") (the consideration described in clauses (i)
and (ii) and the Cash Out Amount (defined below), the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all shares of Bridge Common Stock
that are owned by Bridge as treasury stock and all shares of Bridge Common
Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by WAL or Bridge, including any
shares of Bridge Common Stock held by WAL or Bridge or any of their respective
subsidiaries in respect of a debt previously contracted, other than shares
that are held by WAL, if any, in a fiduciary capacity, shall be canceled and
shall cease to exist and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. All shares of WAL Common Stock that are owned by Bridge
shall become treasury stock of WAL. Subject to the potential adjustment that
may be made to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Merger Agreement and as
provided in Section 1.9(b) of the Merger Agreement, the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be issued or paid shall not exceed 12,494,704 shares of WAL
Common Stock and $36,663,403 million of cash; _provided_ that for each share
of Bridge Common Stock that is issued, from and after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the exercise of Bridge Stock Options
and the vesting of Bridge Restricted Stock, either (i) outstanding as of the
date hereof other than any Bridge Restricted Stock that vests pursuant to the
agreements set forth on schedule 1.5 of the Bridge Disclosure Schedule or (ii)
granted or issued after the date hereof pursuant to and in accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement, the maximum aggregate Merger Consideration
referred to in this subsection shall be increased by 0.8145 shares of WAL
Common Stock and $2.39 in cash. In the event that the foregoing clauses
hereof result in more total Merger Consideration than specified in the
previous sentence, then the total Merger Consideration calculated hereunder
(including the Cash Out Amount and giving effect to dissenting shares as if
they had been converted) shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to the aggregate
amount set forth herein.

(c) _Conversion of Options to Purchase Bridge Common Stock_. Prior to the
Effective Time, each holder of an outstanding, vested and unexercised option
to purchase Bridge Common Stock granted under the Bridge Stock Plans (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) and each holder of an outstanding and
unexercised option that will become vested coincident with or immediately
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms in effect under the
agreements and arrangements listed in Section 1.5 of the Bridge Disclosure
Schedule (other than any requirement of separation from service) (each, a "
_Bridge Stock Option_ ") may elect to exercise any such option in accordance
with the other terms thereof (an " _Exercise Election_ "), contingent on the
consummation of the Merger, and shall receive, for any shares of Bridge Common
Stock acquired in such election, the Merger Consideration. In the event of any
such Exercise Election, all shares of Bridge Common Stock underlying
such exercised options will be deemed to have been issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If the Merger is not completed, any
options for which an Exercise Election has been made will remain outstanding.
At the Effective Time, any outstanding, vested and unexercised option for
which an Exercise Election has not been made shall be canceled and in exchange
for such cancellation the optionee shall receive an amount of cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the excess of (A) the volume weighted
average price of a share of WAL Common Stock over the three trading days
preceding the closing date (the " _Closing Price_ ") over (B) the exercise
price per share of such option and (ii) the number of shares of Bridge Common
Stock subject to such option (in the aggregate, the " _Cash Out Amount_ "),
which cash payment shall be treated as compensation and shall be net of any
applicable federal or state withholding tax. At the Effective Time, any
outstanding, vested and unexercised option for which an Exercise Election has
not

 



3  been made the exercise price per share of which exceeds the Closing Price
shall be converted automatically into an Adjusted Option (defined below), and
shall be treated in the same manner as an unvested Bridge Stock Option in
accordance with the terms hereof. At the Effective Time, each unvested option
to acquire Bridge Common Stock under the Bridge Stock Plans that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Bridge Common Stock
and shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase the number of
shares of WAL Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") equal to the
product of (x) the total number of shares of Bridge Common Stock subject to
such Bridge Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) 0.905
(the " _Equity Award Exchange Ratio_ "), with any fractional shares rounded
down to the next lower whole number of shares. Each Adjusted Option shall have
an exercise price per share of WAL Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to (i) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Bridge Common Stock subject to such Bridge Stock Option divided by (ii) the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio. Each Adjusted Option shall otherwise be subject
to the same terms and conditions applicable to the converted Bridge Stock
Option under the applicable Bridge Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder, including as to vesting. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the foregoing, in all cases, the exercise price of, and the
number of shares subject to, each Adjusted Option shall be determined as
necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, and for any Bridge Stock
Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its
qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the Code, the option
price, the number of shares subject to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply
with Section 424 of the Code.

(c) _Conversion of Bridge Restricted Stock_. Prior to the Effective Time, all
outstanding and vested shares of Bridge restricted stock that are outstanding
and vested immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Bridge
restricted stock that will become vested coincident with or immediately prior
to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms in effect under certain
agreements and arrangements (other than any requirement of separation from
service)), as of the Effective Time, shall be a vested right to receive the
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, each share of Bridge restricted
stock that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, cease to represent a right or award with respect to shares of
Bridge Common Stock and shall be converted automatically into a share of
restricted WAL Common Stock (each, an " _Adjusted Restricted Share_ ") equal
to the product of (x) the number of shares of Bridge restricted stock and (y)
the Equity Award Exchange Ratio (and rounded, as applicable, to the nearest
whole share, with 0.50 being rounded upward). Each Adjusted Restricted Share
shall otherwise be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions
applicable to the converted Bridge restricted stock under the applicable
Bridge Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder, including
as to vesting.

ARTICLE VII

_FURTHER ACTION_

 

The parties hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, all such deeds and other instruments, and will take or cause to be
taken all further or other action as they may deem necessary or desirable, in
order to vest in and confirm to the Surviving

 



4  Corporation title to and possession of all of WALs and Bridges property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises hereunder, and otherwise to carry
out the intent and purposes of this Agreement of Merger.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _EFFECTIVE TIME_

The Merger shall be pursuant to the provisions of, and with the effect
provided in Section 1108 of the California General Corporation Law and Section
252 of the General Corporation Laws of the State of Delaware. The Merger will
become effective on the date and at the time specified in the Certificate of
Merger as filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_DE Certificate of Merger_ "), attached hereto as _Exhibit A_. The date and
time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the DE Certificate of
Merger is referred to herein as the "Effective Time."

ARTICLE IX

 

 _SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS_

 

This Agreement of Merger shall be binding upon and enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors, assigns and transferees, but this
Agreement of Merger may not be assigned by either party without the written
consent of the other.

ARTICLE X

 

 _GOVERNING LAW_

This Agreement of Merger has been executed in the State of California, and
the laws of the State of California shall govern the validity and
interpretation hereof and the performance by the parties hereto.

 

ARTICLE XI

_TERMINATION _

This Agreement of Merger may, by the mutual consent and action of the Boards
of Directors of WAL and Bridge, be abandoned at any time before the filing of
this Agreement of Merger with the Commissioner. This Agreement of Merger shall
automatically be terminated and of no further force and effect if, prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, the Merger Agreement is terminated
in accordance with the terms thereof.

ARTICLE XII

 

 _SATISFACTION OF CONDITION AND OBLIGATIONS_

 

(a) The obligations of Bridge to proceed with the closing are subject to the

duly given by resolution of their respective Boards of Directors, have caused
