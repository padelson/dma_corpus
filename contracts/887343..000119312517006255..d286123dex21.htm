vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 9, 2017 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Columbia Banking System, Inc., a Washington
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Pacific Continental Corporation, an Oregon
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and, from and after its accession to this
Agreement in accordance with Section 6.18, Coast Merger Sub, an Oregon
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ ").

 

RECITALS

 

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination transaction
provided for in this Agreement and have adopted this Agreement.

 

B. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the " _First Merger_ "),
with the Company as the surviving corporation in the First Merger (sometimes
hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

C. Immediately following the First Merger and as part of a single
integrated transaction, the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into
Parent (the " _Subsequent Merger_ "), with Parent as the surviving entity.

 

D. Immediately following the Subsequent Merger, Pacific Continental Bank,
an Oregon state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("
_Pacific Continental Bank_ "), will merge with and into Columbia State Bank, a
Washington state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Columbia Bank_ "), with Columbia Bank as the surviving bank (the " _Bank
Merger_ ," and together with the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger, the "
_Mergers_ ").

 

E. The parties intend that the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger,
taken together, shall be treated as a single integrated transaction and shall
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code.

F. As an inducement for Parent to enter into this Agreement, each of the
members of the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting and Non-Competition
Agreement (collectively, the " _Pacific Continental Voting Agreements_ "),
each dated as of the date hereof and substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit A-1.

 

G. As an inducement for Company to enter into this Agreement, each of the
members of the board of directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has
simultaneously herewith entered into a Voting Agreement (collectively, the "
_Columbia Voting Agreements_ "), each dated as of the date hereof and
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-2. H. The parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Mergers and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the First Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

MERGERS 

1.1 _The First Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Oregon Revised Statutes (the "ORS") at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company in the First
Merger. The Company shall be the Surviving Corporation in the First Merger as
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and shall continue its existence under
the Laws of the State of Oregon. As of the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, on or before the Closing Date, the parties will execute and cause
articles of merger and a plan of merger (" _Oregon Merger Filings_ ") relating
to the First Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Oregon (" _Oregon Secretary_ ") as provided in Section 60.494 of the ORS. The
First Merger shall become effective at such time as such Oregon Merger Filings
have been filed, or at such other time as may be specified therein. The term "
_Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the First Merger becomes
effective in accordance therewith.

1.3 _Effects of the First Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
First Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of
the ORS.

 

1.4 _Conversion of Stock_ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Merger Sub or
Parent or the shareholders of any of the foregoing:

(a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock excluding
Treasury Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio, subject to any adjustments pursuant
to Section 1.4(g), Section 1.4(h) or Section 8.1(e) (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") and subject to the payment of any cash in lieu of fractional
shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f). At the Effective Time, all shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist.

 



-2- (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
owned by the Company as treasury stock or owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent or the Company or any of their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries
(other than those held in a fiduciary capacity or as a result of debts
previously contracted) (" _Treasury Shares_ "), shall automatically be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist at the Effective Time of the
First Merger and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Outstanding Parent Stock_.

 

(i) Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of
Parent Common Stock and shall not be affected by the First Merger.

 

(ii) Each share of Parent Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and
outstanding share of Parent Preferred Stock and shall not be affected by the
First Merger.

 

(d) _Outstanding Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute
the only shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

" _Determination Date_ " means the fifth (5th) Business Day immediately prior

(A) If the Parent Average Closing Price for the Determination Period is
greater than or equal to $27.76 and less than or equal to $37.56, then the
Exchange Ratio shall be 0.6430;

 

(B) If the Parent Average Closing Price for the Determination Period is
greater than $37.56, and (I) the quotient obtained by dividing the Parent
Average Closing Price for the Determination Period by $32.66 (such quotient
the " _Parent Stock Price Ratio_ ") is greater than (II) the quotient obtained
by dividing the Final Index Price by the Initial Index Price (the " _Index
Ratio_ ") after adding 0.15 to the Index Ratio, then the Exchange Ratio shall
be the quotient, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, obtained by dividing
(i) $24.151 by (ii) the Parent Average Closing Price for the Determination
Period;

 



-3- (C) If the Parent Average Closing Price for the Determination Period is
greater than $37.56, and (I) the Parent Stock Price Ratio is not greater than
(II) the Index Ratio after adding 0.15 to the Index Ratio, then the Exchange

the Effective Time and in any event no later than thirty (30) calendar days
following the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option

required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Stock Option which has an exercise price per share

1.8 _Company SARs_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company stock
appreciation right, whether cash-settled or stock-settled (a " _Company SAR_
") granted under the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested, shall,

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

2.1 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent, which
Person shall be a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), pursuant to an agreement
(the " _Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") entered into prior to the Effective
Time, (a) shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.4(a)
and Section 1.6, plus, (b) to the extent then determinable, any cash payable
in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(f) (such amount in cash
and Parent Common Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any
event within five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4 or Section 1.6 (" _Exchanged
Shares_ "), along with, in each case, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares shall pass,
only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the " _Letter of Transmittal_
")) and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 



-8- (b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Share(s) accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, a
holder of Exchanged Shares will be entitled to receive promptly after such
surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
respect of the Exchanged Shares represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Shares. Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration
therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, in
accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby,
in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II, the record
holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest, (i) the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common
Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and paid prior
to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to shares of
Parent Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares with
a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date) and
with a payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock
issuable with respect to such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares representing Exchanged Shares that are not registered in the stock
transfer records of the Company, the shares of Parent Common Stock plus any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Merger
Consideration shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing such Exchanged Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent
(or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the
Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent
Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Corporation) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Exchanged Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Parent or the
Surviving

 



-9-  Corporation, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold under
the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
the making of such payment. If, prior to the Closing Date, the Exchange Agent
or Parent determines that any such deduction or withholding is so required as
of the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, shall
notify the Company and the parties shall cooperate in good faith to reduce or
eliminate such deduction or withholding. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental
Entity, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Exchanged Shares in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent,
as the case may be.

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of such Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares representing any such shares of Company Common Stock are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder
of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall
pay to each former shareholder of the Company who otherwise would be entitled
to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest
cent) determined by multiplying (i) the Parent Average Closing Price for the
Determination Period by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal
form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 1.4. 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company as of the one (1) year anniversary of the
Effective Time will be transferred to Parent. In such event, any former
shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent with respect to the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares, and any unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

 



-10- (h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably
required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

No representation or warranty of the Company contained in Article III (other
than the representations and warranties in Sections 3.2 and 3.8, which shall
be true and correct in all respects with respect to it) shall be deemed untrue
or incorrect, and the Company shall not be deemed to have breached any
representation or warranty, as a consequence of the existence or absence of
any fact, circumstance or event unless such fact, circumstance or event,
individually or taken together with all other facts, circumstances or events
inconsistent with such representation or warranty contained in Article III,
would cause the representation or warranty not to be true in all material
respects. Subject to the foregoing, except as disclosed in any report,
schedule, form or other document filed with or furnished to, the SEC by the
Company prior to the date hereof which is publicly available (without giving
effect to any amendment thereof filed with or furnished to the SEC after the
date hereof, but disregarding risk factor disclosures contained under the
heading "Risk Factors," or disclosure of risks set forth in any "forward-
looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are similarly non-
specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature) or as
Previously Disclosed, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 

(a) _Organization_. The __ Company is a corporation duly incorporated,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Oregon.
The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease
all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary. The Company is duly registered as
a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (" _BHC
Act_ ").

(b) _Articles and Bylaws._ True, complete and correct copies of the
Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the "
_Company Articles_ "), and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the
" _Company_  

 



-11-   _Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously
been publicly filed by the Company and made available to Parent. The Company
Articles and Company Bylaws made available to Parent are in full force and
effect.

(c) _Subsidiaries._ Section 3.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a list of all Subsidiaries of the Company (which, for the avoidance
of doubt, includes any Subsidiaries of such Subsidiaries), the ownership
interest of the Company in each such Subsidiary, as well as the
ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each such Subsidiary
(other than with respect to the preferred securities of Pacific Continental
Capital Trust I and Foundation Statutory Trust I), and a description of the
business of each Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Subsidiary that the Company
considers to be "inactive," a statement to that effect and a description of
the business previously conducted by such Subsidiary). Each Subsidiary of the
Company (i) is duly incorporated or duly formed, as applicable to each such
Subsidiary, and validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and (ii) has the requisite corporate (or similar)
power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary.
There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of the Company to
pay dividends or distributions to the Company, except, in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or
distributions generally applicable to all such regulated entities. As used in
this Agreement, the term " _Subsidiary_ " has the meaning ascribed to it in
Section 2(d) of the BHC Act, except that when such term is used with respect
to an entity that is not a bank holding company, the meaning shall nonetheless
be deemed to apply to such entity. The deposit accounts of each of its
Subsidiaries that is an insured depository institution are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due, and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. True, complete and correct copies
of the articles of incorporation, bylaws and similar governing documents of
each Subsidiary of the Company as in full force and effect as of the date of
this Agreement have been provided to Parent. Other than the Subsidiaries of
the Company, and shares or interests acquired pursuant to security interests
owned by or in favor of a Subsidiary created in the ordinary course of
business thereof, the Company does not, directly or indirectly, beneficially
own any equity securities or similar interests of any entity or any interests
of any entity or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i) 50,000,000
shares of common stock, no par value (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), of
which, as of January 5, 2017 (the " _Company Capitalization Date_ "),
22,613,208 shares were issued and outstanding and (ii) 20,000 shares of
preferred stock, no par value (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which,

-12-  were issued and outstanding. As of the Company Capitalization Date, 750,473
shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance in connection with
awards under the Company Stock Plans, of which (A) 377,409 shares were
reserved and available for issuance upon exercise of outstanding Company Stock
Options, (B) 301,808 shares were outstanding and issuable upon the vesting of
Company RSUs and (C) 71,984 shares were outstanding and issuable in respect
of Company SARs.

(b) All of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued and, are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. As of the date of this Agreement, no
bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote on
any matters on which shareholders of the Company may vote (" _Voting Debt_ ")
are issued or outstanding. There are no contractual obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries (1) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
shares of capital stock of the Company or any equity security of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or any securities representing the right to purchase or
otherwise receive any shares of capital stock or any other equity security of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or (2) pursuant to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is or could be required to register shares of the capital
stock or other securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ "). Except for the Pacific Continental Voting Agreements,
there are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
any of their respective officers or directors, is a party with respect to the
voting of any Company Common Stock, Voting Debt or other equity securities of
the Company. Except as set forth above in Section 3.1(a), the Company does
not have and is not bound by any outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, rights, commitments or agreements of any character calling
for the purchase or issuance of any shares of Company Common Stock, Company
Preferred Stock, Voting Debt of the Company or any other equity securities of
the Company. Section 3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
true and complete list of all Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company
SARs and Company Restricted Shares as of the Company Capitalization Date,
specifying on a holder-by-holder basis (A) the name of such holder, (B) the
number of shares subject to each such award, or the number of Company Stock
Options, Company RSUs, Company SARs or Company Restricted Shares held by such
holder, (C) as applicable, the grant date of each such award, (D) as

Company Disclosure Schedule, no other equity-based awards are outstanding as
of the Company Capitalization Date. Since the Company Capitalization Date
through the date hereof, the Company has not (i) issued or repurchased any
shares of Company Common Stock, Voting Debt or other equity securities of the
Company, other than pursuant to Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company
SARs and Company Restricted Shares in accordance with their terms that were
outstanding on the Company Capitalization Date or (ii) issued or awarded any
options, stock appreciation rights, 

 



-13-  restricted shares, restricted stock units, deferred equity units, awards
based on the value of the Company capital stock or any other equity-based
awards. With respect to each grant of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs,
Company SARs and Company Restricted Shares, (1) each such grant was made in
accordance with the terms of any Company Stock Plan, the Exchange Act and all
other applicable Laws and (2) each such grant was properly accounted for in
accordance with GAAP in the financial statements (including the related notes)
of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC Reports in accordance with the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws. All Company Stock Options and
Company SARs granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been
granted with a per share exercise or reference price, as applicable, at least
equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant,
within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and associated Treasury
Department guidance, and each Company Stock Option and Company SAR has a grant
date identical to or later than the date on which the Company Board or
compensation committee of the Company Board approved such Company Stock
Option or Company SAR, as applicable. Upon issuance of any Company Common

vacation benefits plan or any other agreement or policy or other
arrangement providing employee benefits, employment-related compensation,
fringe benefits or other benefits (whether qualified or nonqualified, funded
or unfunded) (each an " _Employee Benefit Plan_ ").

 

(b) With respect to each material Employee Benefit Plan, the Company has
delivered or made available to Parent a true, correct and complete copy of:
(i) each writing constituting a part of such Employee Benefit Plan, including,
all plan documents, benefit schedules and trust agreements; (ii) the most
recent Annual Report (Form 5500 Series) and accompanying schedule, if any;

related to any Employee Benefit Plan; (iv) each trust agreement, group annuity
contract or other funding mechanism relating to any Employee Benefit Plan,
(v) the current summary plan description and any material modifications
thereto, if any; (vi) the most recent annual financial report, if any; (vii)
the most recent actuarial report, if any; and (viii) the most recent
determination letter or opinion letter from the IRS, if any. Except as
specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered or made available
to Parent, there are no amendments to any Employee Benefit Plan that have been
adopted or approved nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries undertaken
to make any such amendments or to adopt or approve any new Employee Benefit
Plan. No Employee Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States, or covers any employee residing or working outside of the
United States.

(c) Each Employee Benefit Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of
the Code and each related trust intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS
with respect to each such Employee Benefit Plan as to its qualified status
under the Code, including all amendments to the Code effected by the Tax
Reform Act of 1986 and subsequent legislation for the most recent cycle
applicable to such qualified plan pursuant to Revenue Procedure 2005-66 (as
amended or otherwise revised by subsequent IRS guidance), any such letter has
not been revoked (nor has revocation been threatened) and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such letter or
letters from the IRS that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt status of any
such trust.

 

(d) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied in all material respects, and are now in
substantial compliance with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and all Laws and
regulations applicable to such Employee Benefit Plans and each Employee
Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms. Except as would not

 



-21-  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect, there is not now, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any applicable
Employee Benefit Plan that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction
expired as of the date hereof, would be reasonably likely to subject
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA.

 

(e) All contributions required to be made to any Employee Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Employee Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been accrued on the
financial statements set forth in the Company SEC Reports to the extent
required under GAAP. Each Employee Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is either (i) funded through an
insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit fund" with the
meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) unfunded.

 

(f) (i) No Employee Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ")
or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are
not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "
_Multiple Employer Plan_ "); (ii) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries nor
any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six
years, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer
Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; (iii) none of the Company and its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any
Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full; and (iv) no Employee
Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA. " _ERISA
Affiliate_ " means, with respect to any entity, trade or business, any other
entity, trade or business that is a member of a group described in Section
414(b), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA that includes
the first entity, trade or business, or that is a member of the same
"controlled group" as the first entity, trade or business pursuant to Section
4001(a)(14) of ERISA. " _Withdrawal Liability_ " means liability to a
Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA.

 

(g) There does not exist, nor to the Knowledge of the Company, do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to result in, any
Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates following the
Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 or
Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. " _Controlled Group Liability_ " means any and
all 

 



-22-  liabilities (i) under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) under section 302 of ERISA,
(iii) under sections 412 and 4971 of the Code, (iv) as a result of a failure
to comply with the continuation coverage requirements of section 601 et seq.
of ERISA and section 4980B of the Code, and (v) under corresponding or similar
provisions of foreign Laws or regulations.

 

(h) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries has any liability for life,
health, medical or other welfare benefits to former employees or
beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for health continuation coverage
as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or
other applicable Law and at no expense to the Company and its Subsidiaries.
The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has reserved the right to amend,
terminate or modify at any time all plans or arrangements providing for post-
retirement welfare benefits.

 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to result in any liability
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims (other than routine claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been
asserted, threatened or instituted, or to the Knowledge of the Company, no
set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or
lawsuit against the Employee Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Employee Benefit Plans or the assets of any of
the trusts under any of the Employee Benefit Plans. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has taken corrective action or made a filing under any
voluntary correction program of the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any
other Governmental Entity with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan
defect that would qualify for correction under any such program. No audit or
other proceeding by a Governmental Entity is pending or threatened with
respect to any Employee Benefit Plan.

(j) Each Employee Benefit Plan that is or was a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and
associated Treasury Department guidance has been operated in compliance with,
and is in documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and IRS
regulations and guidance thereunder.

(k) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company
Shareholder Approval, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, either alone or together with any other event or events, will (i)
result in any payment (including, severance, golden parachute, forgiveness
of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due under any Employee Benefit Plan,
whether or not such payment is contingent, (ii) increase any payments or
benefits otherwise payable under any Employee Benefit Plan, (iii) result in
the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any benefits
including, but not limited to, the acceleration of the vesting and
exercisability of any equity awards, whether or not contingent, (iv) result in
any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Employee
Benefit Plan or related trust, (v) require the funding of any trust or other

relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

4.10 _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent knows of no
reason why all regulatory approvals from any Governmental Entity required for
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement should not
be obtained on a timely basis.

 

4.11 _Parent Information_. The information relating to Parent and its
Subsidiaries that is provided by Parent or its representatives for inclusion
in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4, or in any
application, notification or other document filed with any other Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading. The portions of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus relating to
Parent and its Subsidiaries and other portions within the reasonable control
of Parent and its Subsidiaries will comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. The Form S-4 will comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder.

 



-44- 4.12 _Legal Proceedings_. There is no suit, action, investigation, claim,

4.13 _Accounting and Internal Controls_.

 

(a) The records, systems, controls, data and information of Parent and its
Subsidiaries are recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control
of Parent or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of access
thereto and therefrom). Parent and its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain
internal control over financial reporting (within the meaning of Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over
financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
Parent, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents assets that could
have a material effect on its financial statements. Parent has designed and
implemented disclosure controls and procedures (within the meaning of Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries is made known to its
management by others within those entities as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications required by the Exchange Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

 

(b) Parents management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
its internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the
requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and such assessment concluded that such controls were
effective. Parent has previously disclosed, based on its most recent
evaluation prior to the date hereof, to its auditors and the audit committee
of the Parent Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting
and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in its internal controls over financial
reporting.

 



-45- (c) Since January 1, 2014, (A) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or
representative of it or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise had
or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion
or written claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods (including with respect to loan loss reserves, write-
downs, charge-offs and accruals) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or written claim that Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices, and (B) no
attorney representing Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not
employed by it or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
it or any of its officers or directors to the Parent Board or any committee
thereof or to any of its directors or officers.

4.14 _Related Party Transactions_. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no transactions or series of related transactions, agreements,
arrangements or understandings, nor are there any currently proposed
transactions or series of related transactions, between Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any current or former director or executive
officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person who beneficially
owns (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 of the Exchange Act) 5% or more of
the Parent Common Stock (or any of such persons immediate family members or
Affiliates) (other than Subsidiaries of Parent) on the other hand, that
are required to be disclosed in a proxy statement pursuant to Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and are not so disclosed.

 

4.15 _Reorganization_. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has taken
or agreed to take any action, and is not aware of any fact or circumstance,
that would prevent or impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede, the First Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

4.16 _No Additional Representations_.

 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in this
Article IV and representations and warranties contained in any certificates
or other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, Neither Parent nor
any other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to Parent, its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or otherwise) or
prospects, and Parent hereby disclaims any such other representations or
warranties. In particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither
Parent nor any other Person makes or has made any representation or warranty
to the Company or any of its Affiliates or representatives with respect to (i)
any financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information
relating to Parent, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses or
(ii) except for the representations and warranties made by Parent in this
Article IV and representations and warranties contained in any certificates or
other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, any oral or written
information presented to the Company or any of its Affiliates or
representatives in

 



-46-  the course of their due diligence investigation of Parent, the negotiation
of this Agreement or in the course of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.16 shall limit the
Companys remedies with respect to claims of fraud arising from or relating to
the express representations and warranties made by Parent in this Article IV.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other Person
has made or is making any representations or warranties relating to the
Company whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given by the
Company in Article III hereof and those contained in any certificates or
other documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement, including any implied
representation or warranty as to the accuracy available to Parent or any of
its representatives. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent acknowledges that no representations or warranties are made with
respect to any projections, forecasts, estimates, budgets or prospect
information that may have been made available to Parent or any of its
representatives.

6.1 _Regulatory Matters_.

 

(a) Parent and the Company shall reasonably promptly prepare and shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC on or prior to
February 23, 2017, and in any event as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
be included. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing, and the Company
and Parent shall thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to their respective shareholders. Parent shall also use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities Law or
"blue sky" permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

 

(b) The parties shall reasonably cooperate with each other and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all
necessary documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and
filings, to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger,
the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
soon as reasonably practicable, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals, and authorizations of
all such third parties or Governmental Entities. Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to make all initial requisite regulatory
filings on or before February 23, 2017, and in any event as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter (other than any notice to the Federal
Reserve under its regulations, which will be filed in accordance with the
timing contemplated by such regulations). The Company and Parent shall have
the right to review in advance and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable Laws, all the non-
confidential information relating to the Company or Parent (excluding any
confidential financial information relating to individuals), as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental
Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable. The parties shall consult with each other
with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations (collectively the " _Approvals_ ") of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the First Merger,
the Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other

 



-52-  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to such Approvals
and the completion of the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting or conference with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the First Merger, the Subsequent
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request, furnish to the
other all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers
and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Form
S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf
of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the First Merger, the Subsequent
Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes
effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at
the date of mailing to the Companys and Parents shareholders and at the time
of the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
misleading. Each of Parent and the Company further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take appropriate
steps to correct the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, as
applicable.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action, or
commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in
connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be likely, in
each case following the Effective Time (but regardless when the action,
condition or restriction is to be taken or implemented), to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent (measured on a scale relative to the
Company) or a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or materially restrict or
impose a material burden on Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
after the Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby or with respect to the business or
operation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective
Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries) (a " _Materially Burdensome
Regulatory Condition_ ").

 



-53- (e) Each of Parent and the Company shall promptly advise the other
upon receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the First Merger, the
Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained or that
the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

 

6.2 _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of the Company and Parent agrees to cooperate with the other
and use its reasonable best efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or desirable, or advisable on its part under this Agreement or under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers, and the other
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, including the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof.

 

6.3 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of
Parent, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement
in accordance with its terms, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records, and, during such period, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Parent (i) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal securities Laws or federal or state banking Laws (other than reports
or documents that the Company is not permitted to disclose under applicable
Law), (ii) all other information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request and (iii) access to the necessary
information (including the Companys own good faith estimates as available
and third-party reports, if any, commissioned by the Company at Parents
request) in order to prepare a good faith estimate of the potential impact of
Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code with respect to amounts potentially
payable to senior executives of the Company in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the
reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall furnish such reasonable
information about it and its business as is reasonably relevant to the
Company and its shareholders in connection with the First Merger, the
Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
to the extent such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration
to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any Law or binding agreement entered into
prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. In addition to the foregoing, on
an every other week basis, the Company shall provide Parent with a listing of
all new and renewed loans and loan modifications, loan payoffs and loan
purchases in the preceding two weeks.

 



-54- (b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to
this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement entered into between the parties dated as of July 27, 2016 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect
or be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or covenants
of the other party set forth in this Agreement.

6.4 _Shareholder Approval_.

(a) The Company agrees to take, in accordance with applicable Law and the
Company Articles and the Company Bylaws, all action necessary to convene as
soon as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective (but in no event
later than forty-five (45) days after the Form S-4 is declared effective), the
Company Special Meeting to consider and to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Subject to Section 6.9(b) and (c), the Company Board shall at all
times prior to and during such Company Special Meeting recommend such
approval and shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit such approval by
its shareholders (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, unless this Agreement has terminated in
accordance with its terms, this Agreement and the First Merger shall be
submitted to the Companys shareholders at the Company Special Meeting whether
or not (x) the Company Board shall have effected a Company Adverse Change of
Recommendation or (y) any Company Acquisition Proposal shall have been
publicly proposed or announced or otherwise submitted to the Company or any of
its advisors. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, adjourn or postpone the Company Special Meeting; provided that the
Company may, without the prior written consent of Parent, adjourn or postpone
the Company Special Meeting (A) if on the date on which the Company
Special Meeting is originally scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company shall adjourn the Company
Special Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and Parent, which date shall not be less than five (5) days nor more
than ten (10) days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best
efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval, (B)
after consultation with Parent, if the failure to adjourn or postpone the
Company Special Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a violation of
applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or (C) after consultation with Parent,
for a single period not to exceed ten (10) Business Days, to solicit
additional proxies if necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval.
Parent may require the Company to adjourn, delay or postpone the Company
Special Meeting once for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days
(but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the End Date) to
solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Company Shareholder 

 



-55-  Approval. Once the Company has established the record date, in respect of
the Company Special Meeting (the " _Company Record Date_ "), the Company shall
not change such Company Record Date or establish a different Company Record
Date for the Company Special Meeting without the prior written consent of
Parent, unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Articles or
the Company Bylaws.

 

(b) Parent agrees to take, in accordance with applicable Law and the Parent
Articles and the Parent Bylaws, all action necessary to convene as soon as
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective (but in no event later
than forty-five (45) days after the Form S-4 is declared effective), the
Parent Special Meeting to consider and to obtain the Parent Shareholder
Approval. The Parent Board shall at all times prior to and during such Parent
Special Meeting recommend such approval and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit such approval by its shareholders. Parent shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Company, adjourn or postpone the
Parent Special Meeting; provided that Parent may, without the prior written
consent of the Company, adjourn or postpone the Parent Special Meeting (A) if
on the date on which the Parent Special Meeting is originally scheduled,
Parent has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval, Parent shall
adjourn the Parent Special Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed
upon by the Company and Parent, which date shall not be less than five (5)
days nor more than ten (10) days after the date of adjournment, and subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all
reasonable best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the
solicitation of proxies from shareholders relating to the Parent Shareholder
Approval, (B) after consultation with the Company, if the failure to adjourn
or postpone the Parent Special Meeting would reasonably be expected to be a
violation of applicable Law for the distribution of any required supplement
or amendment to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or (C) after
consultation with the Company, for a single period not to exceed ten (10)
Business Days, to solicit additional proxies if necessary to obtain the Parent
Shareholder Approval. The Company may require Parent to adjourn, delay or
postpone the Parent Special Meeting once for a period not to exceed thirty
(30) calendar days (but prior to the date that is two (2) Business Days prior
to the End Date) to solicit additional proxies necessary to obtain the Parent
Shareholder Approval. Once Parent has established the record date, in respect
of the Parent Special Meeting (the " _Parent Record Date_ "), Parent shall not
change such Parent Record Date or establish a different Parent Record Date
for the Parent Special Meeting without the prior written consent of the
Company, unless required to do so by applicable Law or the Company Articles or
the Company Bylaws.

 

6.5 _Nasdaq Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall file with
Nasdaq any required notices or forms with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the First Merger.

6.6 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee who is actively
employed by the

 



-56-  Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (each, a " _Continuing
Employee_ ") while employed by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries following the
Effective Time with: (i) base salary no less favorable than the base salary
provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) annual cash bonus opportunities no less favorable than annual cash bonus
opportunities provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of Parent;
and (iii) employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable
than employee benefits provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that until such time as Parent shall cause
Continuing Employees to participate in the benefit plans of Parent, a
Continuing Employees continued participation in the Employee Benefit Plans
shall be deemed to satisfy the foregoing provision of this sentence (it being
understood that participation in Parent benefit plans may commence at
different times with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan).

 

From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and make the payments
provided for, as required by the terms of, all written employment agreements
and change in control agreements with employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, subject to any
limitations imposed under applicable Law or by any regulatory authority.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Company to provide each Continuing Employee who is not party to an individual
employment, severance or change of control agreement at the time of his or her
termination of employment whose employment is involuntarily terminated (other
than under circumstances that constitute a termination for "cause") with the
severance payments and/or benefits, if any, to which the Continuing Employee
is entitled under Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Parent shall
take, or shall cause the Surviving Company to take, other actions in
accordance with Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(b) Upon Continuing Employees enrollment in Parents employee benefit
plans, such Continuing Employees will, consistent with the provisions of
Section 6.6(a) above, become participants in all Parents employee benefit
plans, practices, and policies on the same terms and conditions as similarly
situated employees of Parent. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, prior service credit for each of Continuing Employees service with
the Company, except as expressly provided otherwise herein, shall be given by
Parent with respect to all Parents retirement plans, employee benefit plans,
practices, and policies to the extent that such crediting of service does not
result in duplication of benefits, but not for accrual of benefits under any
defined benefit. If any Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in
any Parent employee benefit plan, practice, or policy that provides medical,
hospitalization or dental benefits, Parent shall use commercially reasonably
best efforts to (a) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or
eligibility waiting periods under such Parent benefit plan to be waived with
respect to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Employee
Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time, and (b) recognize for purposes of annual deductible
and out-

 



-57-  of-pocket limits under their health plans applicable to Continuing
Employees, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents under any Employee Benefit Plan on
or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) If requested in writing by Parent at least thirty (30) calendar days
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken)
all actions reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or appropriate to
terminate, effective not later than the Business Day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, any Employee Benefit Plans that contain a cash or deferred
arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code. In the event
that Parent requests that such plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such plan(s) has been terminated (the
form and substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by
Parent, approval of which shall not be unreasonably withheld) not later than
the Business Day immediately preceding the Effective Time. Effective as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall have in effect a defined contribution plan that
is qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, which Plan shall accept the
transfer of account balances (including promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) of each participant in the Company savings plan as of the
Closing Date.

(d) From and after the date hereof, prior to making any written or oral
communications to officers or employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pertaining to compensation, benefit or other employment-related
matters that are affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication or
talking points, Parent shall have a reasonable period of time to review and
comment on the communication, and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
providing any such mutually agreeable communication.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i) be treated as an
amendment of any particular Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) prevent Parent, the
Company or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any of their
benefit plans in accordance their terms, (iii) prevent Parent, the Company or
any of their Affiliates, after the Effective Time, from terminating the
employment of any Continuing Employee, or (iv) create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any collective bargaining
representative thereof, with respect to the compensation, terms and conditions
of employment and/or benefits that may be provided to any Continuing Employee
by Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates or under any benefit plan
which Parent, the Company or any of their Affiliates may maintain.

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable documented attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or

 



-58-  investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the
extent they are indemnified by the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date
hereof, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; and Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as incurred to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Indemnified
Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six (6) years
following the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will
provide directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_")
that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and directors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time)
(providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified Parties where the
existing policies also include Side B coverage for the Company) with respect
to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or events
occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the same coverage
and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by the Company;
provided, however, that in no event shall the Parent or Surviving Corporation
be required to expend in the aggregate for such six (6)-year period, an amount
in excess of 200% of the aggregate annual premiums paid as of the date hereof
by the Company for any such insurance; provided, further, that if Parent or
the Surviving Corporation are unable to maintain or obtain the DandO Insurance
called for by this Section 6.7(b), Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available at a cost in the aggregate
for such six (6)-year period up to 200% of the current annual premium;
provided, __ further, __ that officers and directors of the Company may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to Parents or the Surviving Corporations insurance carrier for
the purpose of obtaining such DandO Insurance. Prior to the Effective Time and
in lieu of the foregoing, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to
purchase a six (6)-year prepaid "tail" policy for directors and officers
liability insurance on the terms described in the prior sentence and fully
pay for such policy prior to the Effective Time, at an aggregate cost up to,
but not exceeding 200% of the current annual premium for such insurance.

 

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.7(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, will promptly notify Parent or the Surviving Corporation
thereof; provided that failure to so notify will not affect the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation under Section 6.7(a) unless and to the
extent that Parent or the Surviving Corporation is actually and materially
prejudiced as a consequence.

 

(d) In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i)
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Parent and

 



-59-  the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such
defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues
which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation
and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
reasonable documented fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor are received; provided,
however, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant
to this paragraph (d) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified
Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such
Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a conflict of interest;
provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of
interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their prior written
consent; and provided, further, that Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a
court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of
such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

6.8 _Exemption from Liability Under Rule 16(b)-3_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Company shall each take all such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of shares of Company
Common Stock or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

6.9 _No Solicitation; Change in Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) The Company agrees that none of it or any of its Subsidiaries nor any
of their respective officers, directors and employees will, and will cause
its and its Subsidiaries officers, directors, agents, representatives,
advisors and Affiliates not to, initiate, solicit, encourage or knowingly
facilitate any inquiries or the making of proposals with respect to, or
engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or
nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions with, any Person
relating to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or otherwise facilitate any
effort to attempt or make or implement a Company Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
if at any time after the date hereof and prior to, but not after, obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide
Company Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board concludes in good faith
that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably expected
to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company
Board may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries
representatives to, furnish or cause to 

 



-60-  be furnished nonpublic information and participate in such negotiations or
discussions to the extent that the Company Board concludes in good faith
(after consultation with outside legal counsel) that failure to take such
actions would reasonably be expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided that prior to providing any nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or
engaging in any negotiations, it shall have entered into a confidentiality
agreement with such third party on terms no less restrictive in the aggregate
to the counterparty than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and
which expressly permits the Company to comply with its obligations pursuant
to this Section 6.9. Subject to the foregoing and Section 6.9(c) below, the
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted on or before the date of this Agreement
with any persons other than Parent with respect to any Company Acquisition
Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts, subject to applicable Law,
to (i) enforce any confidentiality or similar agreement relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal and (ii) within ten (10) Business Days after the date
hereof, request and confirm the return or destruction of any confidential
information provided to any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates)
pursuant to any such confidentiality or similar agreement. The Company will
promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent
following receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, of any discussions or
negotiations that are sought to be initiated or continued or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
any Company Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof (including the
identity of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal), and will
keep Parent promptly apprised of any related developments, discussions and
negotiations (including the terms and conditions of any such request, inquiry
or Company Acquisition Proposal, or all amendments or proposed amendments
thereto) on a current basis (it being understood that no such communications
to Parent shall be deemed a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation). The
Company agrees that it shall contemporaneously provide to Parent any
confidential or nonpublic information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that may be provided to any other Person in connection with any
Company Acquisition Proposal which has not previously been provided to
Parent.

(c) (i) None of the Company Board or any committee thereof shall: (A)
except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with, Section
6.9(c)(ii)(B) hereof, make any Company Adverse Change of Recommendation; or
(B) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum
of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 6.9(b) entered into in compliance with Section 6.9(b)) relating
to any Company Acquisition Proposal made to the Company.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company Board may make a Company Adverse Change of
Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) if the
Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and the
Company Board concludes in good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; provided that:

 



-61- (A) the Company Board concludes in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that failure to take such actions would reasonably be
expected to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law;

 

(B) the Company provides Parent prior written notice at least five (5)
Business Days prior to taking such action, which notice shall state that the
Company Board has received a Company Superior Proposal and, absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has
resolved to effect a Company Adverse Change of Recommendation or to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d), as applicable, which notice shall
specify the basis for such Company Adverse Change of Recommendation or
termination, including the material terms of the Company Superior Proposal (a
" _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") (it being understood that such Notice of
Superior Proposal shall not be deemed a Company Adverse Change of
Recommendation);

 

(C) during such five (5)-Business Day period, the Company negotiates in
good faith with Parent (to the extent that Parent wishes to negotiate) to
enable Parent to make an improved offer that is at least as favorable to the
shareholders of the Company so that such Company Acquisition Proposal would
cease to constitute a Company Superior Proposal; and 

(D) at the end of such five (5)-Business Day period (or such earlier time
that Parent advises the Company that it no longer wishes to negotiate to
amend this Agreement), the Company Board, after taking into account any
modifications to the terms of this Agreement and the First Merger agreed to by
Parent after receipt of such notice, continues to believe that such Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal; provided that such rules
will in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such
rules would otherwise have under this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, "
_Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means a tender or exchange offer, proposal
for a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other business combination
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to
acquire in any manner more than 15% of the voting power in, or more than 15%
of the fair market value of the business, assets or deposits of, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any public announcement of a proposed plan or
intention to do any of the foregoing or any agreements to engage in any 

 



-62-  of the foregoing, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any sale of whole loans and securitizations in the ordinary course. As
used in this Agreement, " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited
bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board
concludes in good faith to be more favorable from a financial point of view to
its shareholders than the First Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and to be reasonably capable of being consummated on the
terms proposed, (i) after receiving the advice of its financial advisors (who
shall be a nationally recognized investment banking or financial advisory
firm), (ii) after taking into account the likelihood of consummation of such
transaction on the terms set forth therein and (iii) after taking into account
all legal (with the advice of counsel), financial (including the
financing terms of any such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal (including any expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to
closing) and any other relevant factors permitted under applicable Law, and
after taking into account any amendment or modification to this Agreement
agreed to by Parent; provided that for purposes of the definition of "Company
Superior Proposal," the references to "more than 15%" in the definition of
Company Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "at least
50%."

6.10 _Takeover Laws_. No party will take any action that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary
challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as
now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Laws become applicable to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including the
First Merger, the parties shall take all reasonable action necessary to ensure
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the First
Merger, may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Law
on this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including the First
Merger.

 

6.11 _Financial Statements and Other Current Information_. As soon as
reasonably practicable after they become available, but in no event more than
fifteen (15) days after the end of each calendar month ending after the date
hereof, the Company will furnish to Parent, (a) consolidated financial
statements (including balance sheets, statements of operations and
stockholders equity) of it and any of its Subsidiaries (to the extent
available) as of and for such month then ended, (b) internal management
reports showing actual financial performance against plan, and (c) to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, any reports provided to the Company
Board or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk
management of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

6.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company and Parent will give
prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (b) would cause or constitute a breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to a failure of a condition in Article VII.

 



-63- 6.13 _Parent s Board of Directors_. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parents Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall recommend
to the Parent Board one Person from the Company Board to serve on the Parent
Board effective at the Effective Time. Such Person shall have been an active
member of the Company Board as of September 30, 2016 through the Effective
Time, with personal connections to the local civic and business community of
the Company, and shall be qualified as an "independent" director of Parent
under applicable Nasdaq rules and otherwise meet any qualifications under
Parent Bylaws and applicable Laws. Upon approval of such Person by the Parent
Board (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), such director shall be
invited to join the Parent Board and the board of directors of Columbia Bank
(the " _Columbia Bank Board_ ") effective as of the Effective Time. Such
director shall be entitled to compensation, indemnification and expense
reimbursement in connection with his or her role as a director to the same
extent as other directors on the Parent Board and Columbia Bank Board. Upon
Closing or promptly thereafter, Parent shall form an advisory board and invite
all members of the Company Board, as of the date hereof to join such advisory
board on further terms and conditions to be determined by Parent prior to
Closing.

6.14 _Company Trust Preferred Securities, FHLB Borrowings and
Subordinated Debentures_. The Company will cooperate with Parent to effect the
redemption or repayment, as applicable, of trust preferred securities under
the indentures and guarantee agreements relating thereto issued or assumed by
the Company, and the discharge of Pacific Continental Banks FHLB borrowings,
in each case subject to and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing, and
in each case, to the extent permitted by the terms of the governing
indentures and/or applicable governing documentation and subject to and in
each case contingent upon regulatory approval. At the Effective Time, Parent
agrees that it shall expressly assume all of the Companys obligations
in connection with the Companys issuance of $35,000,000 principal amount of
its 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due June 30, 2026 (the "
_Subordinated Debentures_ ") pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of June 27,
2016 (the " _Indenture_ "), as supplemented by the First Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of June 27, 2016, between the Company and Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, as trustee (the " _Trustee_ ") (including, without
limitation, being substituted for the Company), and execute any and all
documents, instruments and agreements, including any supplemental indentures,
guarantees, officers certificates, opinions of counsel and declarations of
trust required by the Indenture, or as may reasonably be requested by the
Trustee thereunder, and thereafter shall perform all of the
Companys obligations with respect to the Indenture.

6.15 _Third-Party Agreements_.

 

(a) The parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (i) the
consents or waivers required to be obtained from any third parties in
connection with the First Merger, the Subsequent Merger, the Bank Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby (in such form and content as
mutually agreed by the parties) 

 



-64-  promptly after the date of this Agreement and (ii) the cooperation of such
third parties to effect a smooth transition in accordance with the parties
timetable at or after the Effective Time, including those items set forth on
Schedule 6.15(a). The Company shall cooperate with Parent as requested by
Parent in minimizing the extent to which any contracts to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries are a party will continue in effect following the
Effective Time, in addition to complying with the prohibitions in Section 5.2.

 

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.15(a), the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide data processing, item
processing and other processing support or outside contractors to assist
Parent in performing all tasks reasonably required to result in a successful
conversion of the data and other files and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to Parents production environment, in such a manner sufficient
to ensure that a successful conversion will occur at the time (on or after the
Effective Time) mutually agreed by the parties, subject to any applicable
Laws, including Laws regarding the exchange of information and other Laws
regarding competition. Among other things, the Company shall:

 

(i) reasonably cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable
project plan to effectuate the conversion;

(ii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Companys
outside contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its
ongoing needs until the conversion can be established;

 

(iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts reasonably
requested by Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably
practicable;

 

(iv) provide reasonable access to the Companys personnel and facilities
and, with the consent of its outside contractors, its outside contractors

calendar month-end and (b) itemized Transaction Expenses reasonably estimated
to be incurred during the period from such calendar month-end and the date

-66- 6.17 _Certain Tax Matters_

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that it intends
for U.S. federal income tax purposes that the First Merger and the Subsequent
Merger, taken together, shall be treated as a single integrated transaction
and shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement for purposes of
Section 368(a) of the Code as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

 

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule to the contrary, none
of the parties shall (and each Party shall cause its respective Subsidiaries
not to) take or agree to take any action that would prevent or impede, or
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the First Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each of the parties shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the First Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, including by executing and
delivering customary tax representation letters to the Companys and/or
Parents counsel, as applicable, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to such counsel, in connection with (i) any tax opinion or
description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the First Merger
and the Subsequent Merger contained or set forth in the Form S-4 and (ii) the
tax opinions referenced in Section 7.3(e) or Section 7.2(e). The parties
intend to report and, except to the extent otherwise required, shall report,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the First Merger and the Subsequent
Merger, taken together, as a "reorganization" within the mean of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 

(c) After the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith with respect to Tax
matters relevant to integrating their respective Subsidiaries and operations.

 

6.18 _Formation of Merger Sub; Accession_. Following the date hereof,
Parent shall form Merger Sub as an Oregon corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. As of its incorporation, Merger Sub shall have 1,000
authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 1,000
shares shall be outstanding and none of which shall be held in the treasury
of Merger Sub. Promptly following the incorporation of Merger Sub, (a) Parent,
as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, shall approve this Agreement and (b)
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to accede to this Agreement by executing
a signature page to this Agreement, after which time, Merger Sub shall be a
party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
the obligations of Merger Sub to perform its covenants hereunder shall
commence only at the time of its incorporation and accession to this
Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take such actions as are
reasonably necessary to cause the Board of Directors of Merger Sub to
unanimously approve this Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall not have carried on any business nor conducted any operations other than
the execution of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder
and matters ancillary thereto.

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in
this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or

or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a
court or a federal or state Regulatory Agency of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions
and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated. If for any reason such court or Regulatory Agency 

 



-76-  determines that any provision, covenant or restriction is invalid, void or
unenforceable, it is the express intention of the parties that such provision,
covenant or restriction be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same
counterpart.

9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Washington, without
giving effect to its principles of conflicts of Laws; provided, that the laws
of the State of Oregon shall apply to the extent mandatorily applicable with
respect to any of the Mergers. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action
or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision of, or based on
any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any federal or
state court located in the State of Washington. Each of the parties hereto
submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction
derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or
proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that
any controversy that may arise under this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, is likely to involve complicated and
difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any legal action, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or
relating to, this Agreement or any documents referred to in this Agreement, or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (b) each party
understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) each party
makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each party has been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and
certifications in this Section 9.8.

 



-77- 9.9 _Publicity_. None of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall, and the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not permit any of their respective
Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any public statement,
or, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, any
disclosure of nonpublic information to a third party, concerning, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of Parent, in the case of a
proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by the Company, or the Company,
in the case of a proposed announcement, statement or disclosure by Parent;
provided, however, that either Parent or the Company may, without the prior
consent of the other party (but after prior consultation with the other party
to the extent practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement to the extent
required by Law or by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq.

9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in
contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by each of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except for Section 6.7, which is intended to benefit each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any person, other
than the parties hereto or their respective successors, any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

9.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the
terms hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are
entitled at Law or equity.

9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_.

 

(a) Before entry into this Agreement, the Company delivered to Parent a
schedule (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") which sets forth, among
other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate either
in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision
hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties
contained in Article III or to one or more covenants contained herein;
provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a representation
or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a
material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 



-78- (b) (a) Before entry into this Agreement, the Parent delivered to
Company a schedule (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") which sets forth,
among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or appropriate
either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a
provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Article IV or to one or more covenants contained
herein; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means
information set forth by the Company in the applicable paragraph of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or any other paragraph of its Company Disclosure
Schedule (so long as it is reasonably clear from the context that the
disclosure in such other paragraph of its Company Disclosure Schedule is also
applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).
