the Effective Time (not including that Inventory located in the Refinery

Sellers (not including Inventory located in the Refinery process units and

Price").   2.3 Adjustment to Base Purchase Price. The Base Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the actual reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred
by Purchaser in connection with obtaining the Financing Commitments, which

value of the Inventory at the Effective Time to be included in the Closing
Purchase Price ("Inventory Estimate") shall be estimated by Sellers and

using the method of determination as described on the Disclosure Schedule.
Not later than 10 days after the Closing, the actual value of the Inventory

calculated pursuant to the method of determination as described on the
Disclosure Schedule.   (b) Not later than 5 days after the Inventory
adjustments have become the Final Inventory Amounts, Sellers or Purchaser, as
the case may be, shall make a payment plus interest with respect to the
Purchase Price based on any differences between the Inventory Estimate and
the Final Inventory Amounts. The interest at the Late Payment Rate shall be
calculated for the period from the Closing Date to the payment date.   (c)
If Purchaser disagrees with the Sellers\' proposed Inventory adjustment, it
may, within ten (10) days after its receipt thereof, deliver a notice to the
Sellers disagreeing with    such calculation and setting forth its
calculation of such amount ("Objection"). If Purchaser does not timely
deliver an Objection, the Sellers\' proposed Inventory adjustment shall be
deemed final (the "Final Inventory Amounts\'). If the Purchaser timely
delivers an Objection, the Sellers shall then have ten (10) days from the
date of receipt to review and respond to the Objection (the "Review Period").
The Sellers and the Purchaser shall use their respective commercially
reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items
or amounts.   If the Purchaser and Sellers are unable to resolve
their disagreements over the Inventory adjustments within ten (10) days
following the expiration of the Review Period, the dispute shall be resolved
by the accounting firm of KPMG LLP ("CPA Firm"). The CPA Firm shall promptly
review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts subject to any scope
that the Parties jointly agree upon. The Purchaser and Sellers shall make
readily available to the CPA Firm all books and records relating to the
Inventory volumes and price calculation and any other items reasonably
requested by the CPA Firm. In resolving the dispute, the CPA Firm shall
consider only those items or amounts on which the Parties have disagreed.  
The CPA Firm shall deliver to the Parties, as promptly as practicable, a
report resolving the disputed Inventory adjustments. Such report shall be
final and binding upon each Party. When received by the Parties the Inventory
adjustments determined in the report shall be deemed the Final Inventory
Amounts. The cost of such review and report shall be borne equally by Sellers
and Purchaser. Neither Purchaser nor Sellers has retained the CPA Firm during
the past two years, and neither Party will retain the CPA Firm at any time
while the CPA Firm is reviewing the disputed Inventory adjustments
in accordance with this Section 2.4(c).   2.5 Method of Payment; Allocation
of Purchase Price.   (a) All amounts to be disbursed at or, pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, prior to the Closing or paid after Closing based
on adjustments, shall be made in immediately available U.S. funds, by wire
transfer to a U.S. bank account designated by Sellers.   However, if
Purchaser notifies Sellers that the condition to Purchaser\'s obligation to
Close set forth in Section 7.2(e) of this Agreement has not been met to the
extent necessary to finance the full amount of the Purchase Price in cash,
Sellers may (but shall not be obligated to), within five (5) business days
following receipt of such notice, elect to notify Purchaser in writing that
Sellers will, in lieu of cash, accept shares of the common stock
of Purchaser\'s Guarantor ("Guarantor Common Stock") valued, as set forth
below, in the amount of up to $100,000,000 to be applied toward the Base
Purchase Price.   If Sellers elect to accept shares of Guarantor Common
Stock as part of the Purchase Price, such shares shall be valued at the
lesser of (i) $15.00 per share less the amount of four and one-half percent
(4.5%) representing a customary underwriting spread in a public offering of
comparable equity securities, or (ii) the amount of the net proceeds per
share (net of underwriting discounts) received by Purchaser\'s Guarantor in
the event that it effects a public offering of Guarantor Common Stock prior
to Closing of an amount less than the size contemplated by the Purchaser\'s
Guarantor as necessary to enable Purchaser to pay the full amount of the
Purchase Price entirely in cash. In such event, at Closing, Purchaser\'s
Guarantor    will issue a certificate to Sellers or its designee
evidencing such shares and the balance of the Purchase Price shall be paid in
cash by wire transfer. In the event that such shares are issued to Sellers as
part of the Purchase Price, Sellers or its designee, as the case may be,
shall have the registration rights provided in Article X below with respect
to such shares.   (b) The Parties agree that $18,750,000 of the
Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Riverside Terminal located at 1237
Riverside Drive in Memphis, Tennessee and its related dock facilities.  
2.6 Limited Assumption and Retention of Liabilities.   (a) Upon the
condition that the Closing shall occur, Purchaser shall assume and agrees to
discharge all liabilities relating to or arising from the ownership or
operation of the Assets from and after the Effective Time and those
additional liabilities and obligations specifically provided for herein
including, but not limited to, all environmental liabilities and obligations
covered by Purchaser\'s indemnity obligations under Article IX.   (b)
Sellers shall retain and be liable for liabilities and obligations of Sellers
related to or arising from the ownership or operation of the Assets prior to
the Effective Time except:   (i) environmental and other liabilities
and obligations expressly assumed by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement; and   (ii) obligations arising after the Effective Time to be
performed after the Effective Time under Contracts, Leases and Easements and
Permits that have been assigned to and assumed by Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement.   ARTICLE III  CLOSING   3.1 Closing. The Closing will
take place at the offices of Sellers or their attorneys in Tulsa, Oklahoma on

as between Sellers and Purchaser, Sellers and their Affiliates have the
absolute and exclusive proprietary right to all Williams Marks and other
marks owned by Sellers    or their Affiliates, and all rights to which,
and that the goodwill represented thereby and pertaining thereto are being
retained by Sellers and their Affiliates.   (b) Effective upon the Closing
Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates grant to Purchaser a nonexclusive,
nontransferable, royalty-free license, without right to sublicense, to use,
solely in the Business as they are presently conducted, any and all Williams
Marks owned by Sellers and their Affiliates solely to the extent appearing on
existing Inventory, advertising materials and property of Sellers or their
Subsidiaries (such as signage, vehicles, and equipment) for a period of three
(3) months from the Closing Date ("License Period").   (c) The Purchaser
may use such existing Inventory, advertising materials and property during
the License Period, but shall not create new Inventory, advertising materials
or property using the Williams Marks. Purchaser shall promptly replace or
remove the Williams Marks on Inventory, advertising materials and property,
provided that all such use shall cease no later than the end of the License
Period.   (d) The nature and quality of all uses of the Williams Marks by
the Purchaser shall conform to the Sellers\' existing quality
standards. Immediately upon expiration of the License Period, the Purchaser
shall cease all further use of the Williams Marks and shall adopt new
trademarks, service marks, and trade names which are not confusingly similar
to the Williams Marks.   (e) All rights not expressly granted in this
section with respect to the Williams Marks are hereby reserved. In the event
the Purchaser breaches the provisions of this section, Sellers may
immediately terminate the License Period upon 15 days written notice. In such
event, Sellers shall be entitled to specific performance of this Section 6.12
and to injunctive relief against further violations, as well as any other
remedies at law or in equity.   6.13 Purchaser\'s Notice. Not later than ten
(10) days prior to the Closing Date, and, again, on the Closing Date prior to
the Closing, Purchaser shall notify Sellers of any breaches of
representations or covenants herein by Sellers of which Purchaser has
knowledge at the time of such notice and with respect to which a prior notice
has not been given pursuant to this Section.   6.14 Other Tax Matters.  
(a) Sellers agree to provide Purchaser and Purchaser agrees to provide
Sellers with such cooperation and information as the other shall reasonably
request in connection with the preparation or filing of any tax return
required under this Agreement.   (b) At the Closing, Sellers shall deliver
to Purchaser a certificate (i) stating that it is not a foreign corporation,
foreign partnership, foreign trust or foreign state, (ii) providing its U.S.
Employer Identification Number and (iii) providing its address, all pursuant
to Section 1445 of the Code, such certificates to be substantially in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit J.     (c) The obligations and agreements
contained in this Section 6.14 shall survive without limitation.   6.15
Information Technology. As soon as practical after the execution of this
Agreement, the Parties shall each designate representatives to a migration
team (the "IT Migration Team") that shall assist Purchaser with identifying
the specific software and hardware necessary for Purchaser to continue
operations of the Business in the manner in which they operate as of the
Closing Date. The IT Migration Team shall also assist Purchaser
with developing a detailed plan to include cost estimates and timetables for
the conversion, loading and integrating of Sellers\' existing data into
Purchaser\'s information technology systems, and the transfer or replacement
of licenses and maintenance agreements not currently held in the Sellers\'
names ("IT Migration Plan"). The IT Migration Team shall complete the
creation of the IT Migration Plan no later than thirty (30) days after
Closing. The time period for implementation of the IT Migration Plan, which
period shall proceed no longer than ninety (90) days after Closing, shall be
referred to as the "IT Migration Period." -   On or before the expiration
of the IT Migration Period, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates,
at Sellers\' sole option, to either: (i) assign (to the extent assignable) to
Purchaser all of their respective right, title and interest in the
Intellectual Property that is licensed from non-Affiliates, and secure any
consents necessary for such assignment and for the use by Sellers
and Sellers\' Affiliates thereof on behalf of Purchaser during the IT
Migration Period; or (ii) obtain for the Purchaser, on commercially
reasonable terms, comparable replacements for any such Intellectual Property
that is not assigned pursuant to (i) above. Fees, costs and expense for
license transfers or replacements shall be borne by Purchaser. Each Party
shall bear its respective labor costs in connection with the creation of the
IT Migration Plan and any implementation of the IT Migration Plan that occurs
during thirty (30) days after Closing. Thereafter, all costs related to the
implementation of the IT Migration Plan shall be borne by Purchaser.  
Purchaser shall assume or pay all termination costs related to the hardware
leases identified during development of the IT Migration Plan, including but
not limited to servers and personal computers, at the time such costs are
identified.   6.16 Non-Software Copyright License. Effective upon the
Closing Date, Sellers, for themselves and on behalf of their Affiliates,
hereby grants to Purchaser a nonexclusive royalty-free, perpetual license,

other intellectual property rights notices provided by Sellers.   6.17

and on behalf of their Affiliates, hereby grant to Purchaser, a nonexclusive

not as a service bureau, all computer software owned by Sellers and/or their
Affiliates which is used in connection with the Business as conducted as of
the Closing Date and with respect to which Sellers or their Affiliates have
the right to grant such a license ("Licensed Software"). Any copies of the
Licensed Software and any documentation    related thereto must contain
all copyright and other intellectual property rights notices included
thereon. Purchaser shall not be entitled to receive and Sellers and their
Affiliates shall have no obligation to provide any modifications,
enhancements, or upgrades made to the Licensed Software developed subsequent
to the Closing Date. Ownership of all intellectual property rights in the
Licensed Software remains with Sellers and their Affiliates. Purchaser
shall not take any action inconsistent with Sellers\' and their Affiliates\'
rights in the Licensed Software. All rights not expressly granted herein to
Purchaser are retained by Sellers and their Affiliates. Except as otherwise
expressly provided in this section, the Licensed Software and any related
documentation are provided on an "as is" basis. Sellers and their Affiliates
hereby expressly disclaim any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness
for a particular purpose. Sellers and their Affiliates do not warrant that
the Licensed Software or documentation are error-free or that Purchaser\'s
use thereof will be uninterrupted.   6.18 HSR Act Filing.   (a) Purchaser
and Sellers agree to take or cause to be taken all actions necessary to (i)
make the filings required of Purchaser and Sellers, or any of their
respective Affiliates, under the HSR Act promptly, but in no event later than
ten (10) business days of the date hereof; (ii) comply at the earliest
practicable date with any request for additional information or documentary
material (or any similar request for information and/or documents) received
by Purchaser, Sellers, or any of their respective Affiliates from
the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the United
States Federal Trade Commission, or the antitrust or competition law
authorities of any State of the United States (the "Antitrust Authority")
pursuant to any applicable antitrust law; and (iii) cooperate in connection
with any filing under applicable antitrust laws and in connection with
resolving any investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby commenced by any Antitrust Authority pursuant to any
applicable antitrust law. Purchaser shall promptly inform Sellers, and
Sellers shall promptly inform Purchaser of any material communication made
to, or received by such party from any Antitrust Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Sellers and Purchaser agree that the
other Party will have the right and be given the opportunity to have
representatives attend all meetings with any Antitrust Authority regarding
the transactions contemplated hereby or any of the matters described in this
Section 6.18.   (b) Without limiting the generality of subsection 6.18(a),
Sellers, Purchaser and their Affiliates shall take all actions
(using commercially reasonable best efforts) that are necessary or reasonably
advisable to (A) obtain approval of any Antitrust Authority of the
transactions contemplated hereby or (B) avoid delay in consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby caused or likely to be caused by an
investigation by any Antitrust Authority; provided, however, each Party\'s
obligations in connection with the foregoing shall be limited to the extent
that any such actions to be taken by a Party are likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect with respect to such Party.   6.19 Consents to
Assignment.   (a) Prior to Closing, Sellers agree to use reasonable
business efforts to obtain all consents to assignment of the Contracts, the
Leases and Easements and the Permits that are    required to be obtained
under this Agreement, even though failure to obtain certain of the consents
is not a condition precedent to the Closing, except as provided for herein;
provided, that neither Party shall be obligated to make payments or incur
obligations to third parties or governmental agencies to obtain such consents
except to pay such Party\'s reasonable expenses or to pay normal fees to
governmental agencies.   (b) To the extent that any Contracts, Leases and
Easements or Permits that would otherwise be assigned under this Agreement
are not capable of being assigned, transferred, subleased or sublicensed
without the consent of, or waiver by, any other party thereto or any other
Person, or if such assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense or attempted
assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense would constitute a breach
thereof or a violation of any Applicable Law, this Agreement shall not
constitute an assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense, or an attempted
assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense of any such Contract, Lease or
Easement or Permit. For a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after
Closing, Sellers shall continue to use their reasonable efforts to obtain a
consent to an assignment from Sellers to Purchaser of each Contract, each of
the Leases and Easements and Permits that, but for the first sentence of this
Section, would be assigned; provided, however, that Sellers shall not be
required to pay any consideration or suffer any financial disadvantages to
obtain such assignment.   6.20 Casualty. Sellers shall bear the risk of loss
with respect to any and all physical damage, destruction or loss of any kind
to the Improvements and Equipment occurring during the period from the date
of this Agreement until the Closing Date ("Casualty"). If any Improvement or
Equipment has been materially damaged, destroyed or lost by Casualty
occurring during the period from date of this Agreement until the Closing
Date, a good faith estimate for appropriate repairs and/or replacements shall
be immediately obtained by Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' employees or
third-party vendors hired by Sellers or their Affiliates, at Sellers\' sole
cost and expense, if any, from a reputable adjuster, independent contractor
and/or vendor, as appropriate in Sellers\' sole discretion. If the total of
the estimates for any one Casualty, or series of related Casualties, exceeds
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), Sellers shall notify Purchaser of
the same in writing immediately after Sellers receive such estimates. Written
notification of such Casualty shall include a copy of each of the
employee\'s, adjuster\'s, contractor\'s and/or vendor\'s estimates stating
with reasonable specificity the materials and work to be provided in regard
to such repairs and/or replacements. In such event, and on the condition that
the estimates provided by the employee, adjuster, contractor and/or
vendor are reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, Purchaser shall have the
option to have Sellers either (i) complete, at Sellers\' expense and prior to
the Closing Date if reasonably possible, any repairs and/or replacements
necessary to restore such Improvements and Equipment to at least their
condition prior to the occurrence of such Casualty, or (ii) convey or assign
to Purchaser, no later than the Closing Date, any insurance proceeds to which
Sellers or their Affiliates may be entitled as a result of the subject
Casualty and credit to Purchaser against the Purchase Price at the Closing
the amount of any shortfall between such insurance proceeds so conveyed or
assigned and the total amount of the estimates described above. If Sellers
fail to obtain in a timely manner estimates from a reliable employee,
adjuster, independent contractor and/or vendor under those circumstances
where such are contemplated by this Section or if the estimates provided to
Purchaser by Sellers pursuant to this Section are not reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser, then    Purchaser may obtain such estimates itself and shall
provide copies of same to Sellers immediately upon Purchaser receiving same.
The cost of obtaining such estimates, if any, shall be borne by
Purchaser.   6.21 Payment of Transfer Taxes; Recording Fees. Purchaser shall
pay (or if paid or required to be paid by Sellers, reimburse Sellers for) all
Taxes which are assessed or imposed with respect to the transfer of the
Assets from Sellers to Purchaser, and all costs to record any deeds. Each
Party shall cooperate with the other to take advantage of all applicable tax
exemptions and provide applicable tax exemption certificates. Purchaser shall
pay any title insurance premium due for any title insurance policies obtained
by Purchaser and Seller shall pay for the costs of any title search fees and
survey costs for searches and surveys initiated by Sellers.   6.22 Payment
of Certain Expenses Due and Payable After the Effective Time;
Cooperation.   (a) Purchaser shall pay, as and when due, all emissions
fees, permit fees and utility bills due and payable after the Effective Time,
and Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser within thirty (30) days after invoice
for any amounts under such bills attributable to any period prior to the
Effective Time. Purchaser shall pay, and be entitled to collect, any rents
due subsequent to the Effective Time under leases which are assumed Leases,
and Sellers shall either pay, or be entitled to receive from Purchaser, as
the case may be, within thirty (30) days after invoice or notice, any amounts
attributable to any period prior to and including the Effective Time.   (b)
Purchaser shall file, or cause to be filed, all required reports and returns
incident to all ad valorem taxes, real property taxes, personal property
taxes and similar obligations, which reports and returns are due on or after
the Effective Time and shall pay or cause to be paid to the taxing
authorities all such taxes reflected on such reports or returns even if same
are for periods prior to the Effective Time and Sellers shall
reimburse Purchaser within thirty (30) days after invoice for any such taxes
and similar obligations which are attributable to any period prior to the
Effective Time; however, under no circumstances shall such reimbursement be
greater than the result of (i) the pro-rated amount Sellers or their
Affiliates would have paid if Sellers or their Affiliates had remained the
owner of the Assets, less (ii) any liabilities attributable to the Assets
which are paid by Sellers directly to any local Governmental Authority or
school district.   (c) Sellers and Purchaser agree to cooperate with the
other in the event one of them or their Affiliates are involved in a tax
controversy concerning the Assets and the other has either records or
personnel which may be of assistance to the Party engaged in the controversy.
Sellers and Purchaser further agree that if, in such Party\'s view, such
cooperation becomes an unreasonable financial burden, they will agree upon a
reasonable method of reimbursement to the burdened Party.   (d) Purchaser
shall pay the transfer tax or registration fee for all vehicles transferred
to Purchaser as part of the Assets.     (e) If a Party hereto makes or has
made any payment to a third party pursuant to any assigned Contract, Lease,
agreement or commitment; and (i) such payment is made in respect of work
performed, services provided or goods delivered during a period of time which
includes the Effective Time; or (ii) the Effective Time intervenes between
the making of such payment and the performance of the work or services or
delivery of goods, the Parties will allocate the burden of such payment in a
manner which reflects the relative benefit of such work performed, services
provided or goods delivered to each Party; provided, however, it shall be
presumed that any work performed, services provided or goods delivered prior
to and including the Effective Time are for the benefit of Sellers and any
work performed, services provided or goods delivered after the Effective Time
are for the benefit of Purchaser.   6.23 Relationship of the Parties.  
(a) Nothing in this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby
shall be construed to create any joint venture, partnership, agency or other
similar fiduciary relationship between the parties hereto or thereto.
The Parties and their Affiliates under this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby are nothing other than independent contractors
for the sale or purchase of specific property, goods or services. The Parties
hereto acknowledge that, for purposes of this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby, (i) none of the Parties or their Affiliates
shall be considered to be the agent, representative, employee, master, or
servant of the others for any purpose, (ii) none of the Parties or their
Affiliates shall have any obligation to manage or operate any of their
respective businesses with any duty or standard of care to the other Party or
their Affiliates, and (iii) none of the Parties or their Affiliates have any
authority, right or power to enter into a contract or commitment, assume any
obligation or make any representation or warranty on behalf of the others
(except as expressly specified in this Agreement or the other agreements
contemplated hereby). The Parties agree and acknowledge that except as
expressly provided herein or in the other agreements contemplated hereby,
none of the Parties or their Affiliates shall owe duties, fiduciary or
otherwise, to the other. The Parties and their Affiliates are, and will be
after Closing, competitors with the right to pursue any business opportunity
for their respective individual benefit and make no representation or
warranty regarding the manner in which they will conduct their
respective businesses and operations. None of the Parties or their Affiliates
shall have any obligation to refrain from (i) engaging in the same or similar
activities or lines of business as the Parties or their Affiliates, (ii)
developing or marketing any products or services that compete, directly or
indirectly with those Parties or their Affiliates, (iii) investing or owning
any interest publicly or privately in, or developing a business relationship
with, any Person engaged in the same or similar activities or lines of
business as, or otherwise in direct or indirect competition with, the Parties
or their Affiliates, or (iv) doing business with any client or customer of
the Parties or their Affiliates. None of the Parties or their Affiliates
shall have any obligation to offer any business opportunity and may modify or
otherwise change any of their respective businesses or operations at any
time.   6.24 Preparation of Audited Financial Statements. Sellers
covenant and agree with Purchaser that Sellers will take such actions as are
reasonable necessary to ensure audited consolidated financial statements of
Sellers for the years ended 1999, 2000 and 2001 and unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Sellers for the nine-month stub period
ended    September 30, 2002 relating to the Assets (the "Audited Financial
Statements") are made available to Purchaser as soon as practical after the
execution of this Agreement. The Audited Financial Statements are to be
prepared in accordance with GAAP, and all of the costs relating to the audit
are to be paid by Purchaser.   6.25 Financing Covenants. Purchaser and
Purchaser\'s Guarantor will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to
secure the financing which is a condition for the Purchaser to perform its
obligations hereunder as provided in Section 7.2(e). In this regard,
Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Guarantor will take or cause to be taken all
action that is reasonably required in order to comply with or satisfy the
Financing Commitments. Additionally, unless Purchaser has the fully-committed
financing and cash on hand to complete the purchase contemplated by this
Agreement at Closing, between the date of signing of this Agreement and the
Closing, Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Guarantor will not enter into any
commitment or transaction which would limit, hinder or impair Purchaser\'s
ability to consummate its purchase obligations hereunder. Purchaser and
Purchaser\'s Guarantor will keep Sellers informed of any
revisions, revocations, expirations, withdrawals or other changes in any of
the Financing Commitments that Purchaser or Purchaser\'s Guarantor may
receive and in the actions or prospects contemplated thereby. In the event
that Purchaser or Purchaser\'s Guarantor intends to issue a press release
relating to the financing described by this Section, Purchaser or
Purchaser\'s Guarantor must first consult with and obtain Sellers\' approval
of such press release, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld.  
6.26 Stockholder Approval of Issuance of Guarantor Common Stock.
If stockholder approval is determined to be necessary under stock exchange
rules applicable to Purchaser\'s Guarantor in connection with the issuance of
shares of Guarantor Common Stock in lieu of a portion of the cash Purchase
Price pursuant to Section 2.5, Purchaser\'s Guarantor, shall:   (a) at
Closing, issue to Sellers (i) that number of shares of Guarantor Common Stock
which it is permitted to issue without stockholder approval, and (ii) an
exchangeable or convertible promissory note which will, upon receipt of such
stockholder approval, be automatically exchanged for or converted into the
number of shares of Guarantor Common Stock which, when added to the number of
shares issued at Closing, would equal the total amount of Guarantor Common
Stock which Sellers would have been entitled to receive at Closing but for
the requirement to obtain stockholder approval;   (b) duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders promptly following
a determination that stockholder approval is necessary for the purpose of
considering and taking action upon a proposal to approve such action as may
be necessary for the issuance of the shares of Guarantor Common Stock upon
the exchange or conversion of such note;   (c) prepare and file with the
Commission a preliminary proxy statement and use its commercially reasonable
efforts (x) to obtain and furnish the information required to be included by
the Commission in the definitive proxy statement, and, after consultation
with the Sellers, to respond promptly to any comments made by the Commission
with respect to the preliminary proxy statement and cause a definitive proxy
statement to be mailed to its    stockholders and (y)to obtain the
necessary approval of the necessary action by its stockholders; and   (d)
include in the proxy statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors
that stockholders of the Purchaser\'s Guarantor vote in favor of the approval
of the stockholder proposal.   6.27 Listing of Guarantor Common Stock.

Closing Date from, any Governmental Authority or other Person in connection
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby by Sellers and Purchaser shall have been
made or obtained (as the case may be), except where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, permits, releases and authorizations would not
be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Sellers\'
assets, taken as a whole, or the Business or to materially adversely affect
the Closing or to be contrary to Applicable Laws.   (b) No Injunctions or
Restraints. No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent
injunction or other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or
other legal restraint or prohibition, including legislation, preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated herein shall be in effect;

representations and warranties of Sellers and Sellers\' Guarantor set forth
in Article IV shall be true and correct in all material    respects
(provided, that any such representation or warranty that is qualified by a
materiality standard or a Material Adverse Effect qualification shall not be
further qualified hereby as to materiality) as of the Closing Date as
though made on and as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall have received

have obtained, on terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to it, all of
the financing it needs, including but not limited to, the sale of equity
securities, in order to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and

failure to obtain such financing will excuse Purchaser\'s obligation to be

notification shall be accompanied by a notice from Purchaser\'s lead
investment banker regarding its opinion as to the dollar amount of equity

sufficient number to provide the financing that Purchaser needs.   (f)
Taking of Assets. In the event that prior to Closing there shall be
instituted or threatened any proceeding or other action, including, without
limitation, eminent domain, condemnation or other governmental proceeding,
that results in a reasonable probability of Sellers or Purchaser (after
Closing) losing any portion of or interest in the Assets, Sellers shall
immediately notify Purchaser, and Purchaser, if such proceeding has a
reasonable probability of a taking of Assets with a value in excess
of Twenty-Five Million Dollars ($25,000,000), shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement within ten (10) days from the date of such notice,
by giving notice to Sellers of the election to terminate. If Purchaser is not
entitled to or, if entitled, does not timely terminate this Agreement, then
Sellers shall assign to Purchaser at Closing any rights Sellers may have to
receive any payments (net of any expenses) as a result of any such proceeding
or other action.     (g) Material Adverse Change. Prior to the Closing,
there shall not have been any change (other than changes affecting the
economy generally or affecting the petroleum industry, including refining,

Assets (for the types of purposes to which the same have been or could
lawfully have been devoted at any time during the six (6) month period

however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause
(i) shall not be available to Sellers if Sellers\' breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant or agreement
under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Closing to occur on or before such date); (ii) there has been a breach of the
representations and warranties made by Purchaser or Purchaser\'s Guarantor
in Article V that results in a Material Adverse Effect as to the Purchaser
or Purchaser\'s Guarantor (provided, however, that Sellers shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii) unless
Sellers have given Purchaser at least 30 days prior notice of such breach,
Purchaser has failed to cure such breach within such 30-day period, and the
condition described in Section 7.3(a), other than the provision thereof
relating to the certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of Purchaser,
would not be satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the day on which
Sellers gives Purchaser notice of such termination); (iii) Purchaser has
failed to comply in any material respect with any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, and such failure has not been, or
cannot be, cured within a reasonable time after notice and a demand for cure
thereof; or (iv) the Purchaser has not effected the financing contemplated by
Section 7.2(e).   8.2 Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise provided,
if this Agreement is terminated by either Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to
the provisions of Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
except for, and there shall be no further obligation under this Agreement on
the part of either Party or its respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
or stockholders except pursuant to, the provisions of Sections 6.3(d), 6.3(f)
and 6.6 and Article X (which shall continue pursuant to their terms);
provided, however, that a termination of this Agreement shall not relieve
either Party from any liability for damages incurred as a result of a breach
by such Party of its representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
other obligations hereunder occurring prior to such termination (including
without limitation, Sellers\' and Purchaser\'s rights to liquidated damages
in certain events as provided in Section 11.7 below).     ARTICLE IX 
INDEMNIFICATION AND THIRD PARTY CLAIMS   9.1 Indemnification.   (a) Each
of Sellers and Purchaser (each an "Indemnifying Party") hereby agrees to be
responsible for, pay for and indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other
Party, and its directors, officers, manager, owners, shareholders, employees
and Affiliates (hereinafter, collectively, "related persons"), from and
against any and all Claims (as that term is defined below in Section 9.1(d))
asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or incurred by such other Party
or such other Party\'s related persons (each an "Indemnified Person"),
relating to, arising from or resulting from:   (i) the inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty of the Indemnifying Party contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement, other than Section 4.12 (concerning
Environmental Matters) which is covered by a separate indemnity set forth in
Section 9.4 or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement; and  
(ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of the Indemnifying Party
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement.   (b) Purchaser shall be
responsible for, shall pay for and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Sellers
and their related persons harmless from and against, any and all Claims:  
(i) relating to, arising from or resulting from all environmental matters
that are not covered by Sellers\' indemnity in Section 9.4 (excluding
anything for which Sellers would have been otherwise obligated to indemnify
Purchaser but for the Sellers\' limitations on its
indemnification obligations described in Sections 9.4(c)(iii) and 9.7) and
from the ownership or operation of the Assets from and after Effective Time;
and   (ii) relating to, arising from or resulting from its obligations
under the provisions of Section 6.9 of this Agreement.   (c) Sellers shall
be responsible for, shall pay for and shall indemnify, defend, and hold
Purchaser and its related persons harmless from and against, any and all
Claims:   (i) relating to, arising from or resulting from the ownership or
operation of the Assets prior to the Effective Time except for Claims which
are specifically addressed by the provisions of Section 9.4, which Claims
shall be governed by that section; and   (ii) relating to, arising from or
resulting from their obligations under the provisions of Section 6.9 of this
Agreement.     (d) As used in this Article IX, the term "Claim"
shall include (x) all debts, liabilities and obligations; (y) all losses,
damages, costs and expenses, including pre- and post-judgment interest,
penalties, fines, court costs and attorneys\' fees and expenses; and (z) all
demands, claims, actions, costs of investigation, causes of action,
proceedings, arbitrations, controversy judgments, settlements and
assessments, whether or not ultimately determined to be valid and whether
based on contract, tort, statute, strict liability, negligent acts or
omissions or other legal or equitable theory.   9.2 Defense of Third Party
Claims. In the event any Claim is asserted against any Indemnified Person by
a third party, the Indemnified Person shall, with reasonable promptness,
notify the Indemnifying Party of such Claim. If the Indemnified Person does
not so notify the Indemnifying Party within 30 days after becoming aware of
such Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall, if such delay materially
prejudices the Indemnifying Party with respect to the defense of such Claim,
be relieved of liability hereunder in respect of such Claim only to the
extent of the damage caused by such delay. Within fifteen (15) days of the
receipt of a notice of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party whether the Indemnifying Party elects to defend such Claim.
In any such proceeding, following receipt of notice properly given,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, at its sole discretion, to assume
the entire defense of such Claim (with counsel selected by it which is
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person or Persons), and the
Indemnifying Party shall bear the entire cost of defending such Claim;
provided that if, in the Indemnified Party\'s and the Indemnifying Party\'s
reasonable judgment, a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim, or if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend such Claim, or if the Indemnifying
Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the fifteen (15) day
notice period that it elects to defend such Claim, such Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to select counsel of its own choosing, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is finally
determined to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party under
this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to settle any
such Claim without the written consent of the Indemnified Person or Persons,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that the
Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any such settlement, compromise or
judgment without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party if it
would result in the imposition of any non-monetary liability or obligation on
the Indemnified Party. In the event of the assumption of the defense by the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
further legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified
Persons in connection with such defense unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by the Indemnifying Party or as herein provided; provided, however, the
Indemnified Persons shall have the right to participate in such defense, at
their own cost, and shall have the obligation to cooperate therewith. If the
Indemnifying Party refuses or fails at any time to defend the Indemnified
Party against any Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
undertake the defense, and to compromise or settle such Claim on behalf of
and for the account and at the risk of the Indemnifying Party to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is finally determined to be obligated
to indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Agreement with respect to such
Claim.   9.3 Limits on Indemnity Obligations. The indemnity obligations
of the Parties under this Article IX, except for those under Sections 9.4
through 9.6 (which are subject to the restrictions and limitations stated in
those sections) unless otherwise specifically stated in this Section 9.3, are
subject to the following restrictions and limitations:     (a) No
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to seek indemnification from any
Indemnifying Party with respect to any Claim under Section 9.1(a)(i) unless
such Indemnified Person notifies such Indemnifying Party of such Claim within
the survival period set forth in Section 9.7.   (b) No individual Claim of
the Purchaser or any of its related persons under Section 9.1 shall be made
for indemnification hereunder unless it exceeds an amount equal to $150,000
(`Purchaser Claims"). Furthermore, if the total amount of all Purchaser
Claims (exclusive of Purchaser Claims covered by Section 9.4), including the
immediately preceding sentence, does not exceed an amount equal to $5,000,000
(the "Deductible"), then Sellers shall have no obligation under this Article
IX with respect to any such Claim. If the total amount of all Purchaser
Claims exceeds the Deductible, then Sellers\' obligations under this Article
IX shall be limited to the amount by which the aggregate amount of all
Purchaser Claims exceeds the Deductible.   (c) Sellers\' obligations under
this Article IX (excluding any amounts it is required to pay under Section
9.4) shall be limited to an aggregate maximum amount of $50,000,000 (the
"Ceiling").   (d) Except as otherwise specifically provided in
this Agreement, in the absence of fraud, the sole and exclusive remedy of
both Purchaser and Sellers hereunder or otherwise in connection with Claims
for matters covered in Section 9.1 shall be restricted to the rights set
forth in this Article IX, excluding, however, any cause of action for
specific performance.   (e) No Claims shall be recoverable by an
Indemnified Person with respect to any matter which is covered by insurance
or a third party indemnitor, to the extent that proceeds of such insurance or
other third party indemnitor are paid net of any costs incurred in connection
with the collection thereof (including, but not limited to, present,
retrospective or future premiums, self-insured retention amounts,
deductibles, legal and administrative costs and costs of investigations); and
an Indemnified Person, hereby agrees to exhaust all reasonable remedies
against all applicable insurers or indemnitors prior to recovering any
amounts hereunder. All Claims shall be reduced by any tax savings to be
realized by the Indemnified Person in connection with such matter.   9.4
Environmental Indemnity   (a) Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its related parties from and against any Claims
suffered or incurred by Purchaser solely (i) as a consequence of a breach of
the representations and warranties contained in Section 4.12; (ii) as a
consequence of any Claims for environmental liabilities known to Sellers
before Closing but not disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule; and (iii) as a
consequence of any Claims for environmental liabilities not known to Sellers
prior to Closing. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding sentence to
the    contrary, Sellers\' environmental indemnities shall not apply to
Claims suffered or incurred by Purchaser arising out of any EPA Section 114
proceedings or actions relating to the Assets, including such proceedings or
actions as may arise with respect to all scheduled environmental liabilities
or with respect to environmental liabilities not known to Sellers before
Closing ("Purchaser\'s Section 114 Environmental Obligations"). With respect
to all environmental liabilities not known to Sellers prior to the Closing,
Purchaser understands and acknowledges that Sellers have purchased the
Environmental Insurance Policy naming the Purchaser as an additional insured
and that Purchaser has agreed to comply with the terms of the Environmental
Insurance Policy as a condition to Sellers\' indemnity obligations under this
Section 9.4. Purchaser shall assume, and indemnify Sellers and their related
parties from and against, all environmental liabilities described on the
Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser\'s Section 114 Environmental
Obligations.   (b) Sellers\' obligation with respect to Claims by Purchaser
for the matters addressed in Section 9.4(a) shall be limited to those matters
as to which Purchaser provides Sellers with written notice (such notice to
conform with other relevant provisions of this Agreement and to contain,
to the extent available, reasonable details of the claim for which indemnity
is sought) of said claim within seven (7) years after the Closing Date.
Sellers\' obligations with regards to Claims by Purchaser for environmental
liabilities not known to Sellers prior to Closing shall be conditioned upon
Purchaser\'s compliance with the terms of the Environmental Insurance
Policy.   (c) With respect to Claims by Purchaser relating to matters that
are described by Section 9.4(a):   (i) Sellers shall only be required to
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Indemnified Person
(each a "Purchaser Indemnified Person") to the extent that: (A)
investigation, containment or remediation of the Hazardous Material is
required pursuant to an applicable Environmental Law that is in effect as of
and is enforceable as of the Closing Date and is of the type required by any
Governmental Authority at the time of Closing; (B) the Remediation Standards
(as defined in Section 9.4(f)) that must be met in order to satisfy the
requirements of the applicable Environmental Law are no more stringent than
the Remediation Standards that (i) were in effect as of and were enforceable
as of the Closing Date under the applicable Environmental Law that is the
source of the obligation to conduct a remediation, or, where no such
Remediation Standards had been promulgated and were enforceable as of the
Closing Date, Remediation Standards that were applied, within one year prior
to the Closing Date, on a case-by-case basis, to properties that are most
similar to the property that is subject to a remediation and would be the
least stringent Remediation Standards, taking into account that the normal
operating condition at the affected facility shall be maintained at all
times, that would be applicable given the use of the property as of the day
before the Closing Date or as required by any Governmental Authority; and (C)
such investigation and/or remediation is conducted using the most cost-
effective methods, taking into account that the normal operating condition at
the affected facility shall be maintained at all times, for investigation,
remediation and/or containment consistent with applicable Environmental Law.
If Sellers are undertaking remedial action, Sellers shall not be responsible
for any effect the remediation has upon the business or operations of
Purchaser (including,    without limitation, business interruptions or
lost profits); however, Sellers agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to avoid or minimize any business interruption.   (ii) If the costs of an
investigation or remediation at any of the Real Property that is subject to
an indemnity by Sellers hereunder are increased due to an act or omission
(after the Closing) by a person other than Sellers, or an Affiliate of
Sellers, Sellers shall not be responsible for any such increase in costs
incurred. Sellers shall not be responsible for any increased costs or
increased Claims by Purchaser under this subsection to the extent they arise
by reason of (A) the voluntary closure of Operations at any Real Property or
(B) a material change in use of any of said property from the use of said
property as of the Closing.   (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Sellers shall not have any obligation in connection with
this Section 9.4 unless each individual Claim exceeds $50,000, regardless of
whether such Claim is covered by the Environmental Insurance Policy. In no
event will Sellers be liable under this Section 9.4 for an aggregate amount
exceeding $50,000,000 in excess of the amounts of Environmental Claims and
Losses paid or provided under the Environmental Insurance Policy described in
Section 6.11.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
with respect to claims arising pursuant to 9.4, Seller shall not be obligated
to indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Persons for the costs and expenses
associated with Purchaser Indemnified Persons\' overseeing of Sellers\'
performance of its defense and indemnity obligations, including, but not
limited to, the costs and expenses of overseeing of Sellers\' legal counsel,
consultants, or employees, and Sellers shall not be obligated to indemnify
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any costs or expenses of Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for management and employee time costs.   (e) To the
extent that Purchaser Indemnified Persons make a claim, pursuant to Section
9.1, for breach of the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.12, the provisions of this 9.4 shall be applicable to such claim. Claims
brought pursuant to this 9.4 shall be subject to the procedures for
indemnification set forth in Section 9.2 if such claims are third party
claims.   (f) For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Remediation Standard" means a numerical standard (whether resulting from an
enacted statute, promulgated regulation, guidance or policy document issued
by a regulatory agency, or developed on a case-by-case basis through a risk
assessment or other methodology authorized pursuant to an applicable
Environmental Law and acceptable to the Governmental Authority) that defines
the concentrations of Hazardous Material that may be permitted to remain in
any environmental media after an investigation, remediation or containment of
a release of Hazardous Material.   9.5 Exclusive Remedy for Environmental
Matters; Indemnification by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser Indemnified Persons hereby agree that
their sole and exclusive remedy against Sellers and its related persons, with
respect to any and all matters arising under or related to Environmental Law
or Hazardous Material (with respect to the Business), Sellers (with respect
to the Business), and the Real Property, shall be the indemnity set forth in
9.4. Except with respect to the remedy referred to in    the preceding
sentence, the Purchaser Indemnified Persons hereby waive, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, and forever release Sellers and (with
respect to the Business), the Real Property, from, any and all
Purchaser Claims arising under Environmental Laws or relating to Hazardous
Material or the environment.   9.6 Environmental Fines and Penalties.
Without limitation as to time, Sellers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Purchaser and its related parties from and against any Claims
suffered or incurred by Purchaser solely as a consequence of any fines or
penalties accessed against Purchaser that result from Sellers\' operation of
the Business or ownership of the Assets prior to Closing; provided, however,
that Purchaser will notify Sellers of all EPA Section 114 and other
Governmental Authority actions, proceedings, meetings and notices relating to
the Assets and involving pre-Closing environmental matters that might
reasonably lead to any fines or penalties upon Sellers, and shall endeavor in
good faith to facilitate Sellers\' participation therein.   9.7 Survival.
The representations, warranties and covenants made in this Agreement or in
any certificate or instrument delivered in connection herewith and the
concomitant indemnities relating thereto shall survive the Closing and
continue to be applicable and binding thereafter for a period of three (3)
years after the Closing Date (except for the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 4.8 and 4.10, and the related indemnities, which shall
survive for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date and for the
representations and warranties contained in Section 4.12 and the indemnities
related thereto which shall survive for a period of seven (7) years after the
Closing Date), at which time the same shall terminate and
be extinguished.   ARTICLE X  REGISTRATION RIGHTS   10.1 Registration
Rights. In the event that Sellers elects to accept shares of the Guarantor
Common Stock as part of the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5, Sellers
shall have the following rights:   (a) As used in this Section 10.1, the
following terms have the meanings set forth below:   "Commission" means the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission.   "Demand Registration
Statement" means a registration statement on Form S-1 or S-3 filed with the
Commission under the Securities Act.   "Disadvantageous Condition" has the
meaning set forth in Section 10.1(b)(iii).   "Exchange Act" means the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.   "Holders" means the Sellers
or any Person who becomes a holder of Subject Securities after the Closing
Date as a result of a No-Sale Transaction.     "No-Sale Transaction" means
a transfer from a Holder of Subject Securities that does not constitute a
"sale" (as such term is understood and defined under the Securities Act),
including without limitation a distribution from a Holder that is a
corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
association or trust to the owner of a beneficial interest in such Holder,
provided, however, that in any such transaction the recipient must be able to
tack the holding period to that of the Holder.   "Guarantor Common Stock"
means the shares of common stock, par value $_per share, of Purchaser\'s
Guarantor.   "Piggy-back Registration" has the meaning set forth in
Section 10.1(g)(i).   "Registration Expenses" has the meaning set forth in
Section 10.1(e).   "Registration Termination Date" means the second
anniversary of the date when the Commission first declares the Demand
Registration Statement effective; provided, however that the Registration
Termination Date shall be extended for a period equal to the aggregate period
or periods during which the Holders have been precluded from selling any
Subject Securities under subparagraph (b)(iii) by reason of receipt of a
Suspension Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Registration
Termination Date shall occur at such earlier date as the Subject Securities
become freely transferable on the public market without any restrictions or
limitations pursuant to Rule 144(k) promulgated by the Commission or has been
sold in compliance with the Securities Act.   "Securities Act" means the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.   "Subject Securities" means the shares
of Guarantor Common Stock issued as part of the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.5, and any common stock or other security issued or issuable as a
dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for, or upon
conversion or in replacement of, any of such Guarantor Common Stock;
provided, however, that a security is not a Subject Security after (i) it has
been effectively registered and disposed of under the Securities Act, (ii) it
has been publicly sold pursuant to Rule 144 (or any similar provisions then
in force) under the Securities Act, or (iii) it is capable of being disposed
of without volume restrictions pursuant to Rule 144(k) (or any similar
provisions then in force) under the Securities Act..   "Suspension Notice"
has the meaning set forth in Section 10.1(b)(iii).   (b) (i) If the Subject
Securities are issued pursuant to Section 2.5, as promptly as practicable
after receipt of a written request by the Holders of at least 25% of the
Subject Securities (but in no event more than 30 days thereafter, subject to
Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s right to extend such time in the event that there
exists any Disadvantageous Condition which would permit Purchaser\'s
Guarantor to issue a Suspension Notice if the Demand Registration Statement
were already effective), Purchaser\'s Guarantor will, on up to three (3)
occasions, prepare and file    with the Commission a Demand Registration
Statement for the purpose of registering the resale in the market from time
to time of the Subject Securities by Holders or by potential assignees of
such Holders to which all or a portion of such Holders\' Subject Securities
may be transferred in a No-Sale Transaction.   (ii) Purchaser\'s Guarantor
will use its reasonable efforts to have the Demand Registration Statement
declared effective by the Commission as promptly as practicable and
thereafter to maintain the effectiveness of the Demand Registration Statement
and, subject to subparagraph (iv) below, to maintain such Demand Registration
Statement "current" (as below defined) at all times until the Registration
Termination Date. Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall promptly give written notice
to the Holders when the Registration Statement has been declared effective by
the Commission and is available for use by Holders for the resale of Subject
Securities.   (iii) If the Holders initiating the registration request
hereunder ("Initiating Holders") intend to distribute the Subject Securities
covered by their request by means of an underwriting, they shall so advise
Purchaser\'s Guarantor as a part of their request made pursuant to subsection
10. 1(b)(i). The managing underwriter will be selected by the Initiating
Holders and shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchaser\'s Guarantor. In such
event, the right of any Holder to include its Subject Securities in
such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder\'s participation in
such underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder\'s Subject Securities in
the underwriting (unless otherwise mutually agreed by a majority in interest
of the Initiating Holders and such Holder) to the extent provided herein. All
Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such underwriting
shall (together with Purchaser\'s Guarantor) enter into an underwriting
agreement in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for
such underwriting; provided, however, that no Holder (or any of their
Permitted Transferees) shall be required to make any representations,
warranties or indemnities except as they relate to such Holder\'s ownership
of shares and authority to enter into the underwriting agreement and to such
Holder\'s intended method of distribution and as otherwise may be required by
applicable law or regulation. In addition, to the extent requested by the
Holders or the managing underwriter, Purchaser\'s Guarantor will conduct and
engage in the marketing activities normally or typically engaged in by an
issuer in connection with an underwritten offering of its securities.  
(iv) The Demand Registration Statement shall not be considered to be
"current" at any time when, by reason of occurrence of any event or by reason
of the passage of time, the Demand Registration Statement does not meet the
requirements of Section 10, Section 12(2) or Section 17 of the Securities
Act, or the Demand Registration Statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.
The Demand Registration Statement shall disclose that Holders may elect to
resell Subject Securities without registration of such sales under the
Demand Registration Statement, by making such sales under and as permitted by
Rules 144 or 145, as applicable, of the Commission under the Securities Act.
If at any time or times after the Demand Registration Statement is declared
effective by the Commission, Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s Board of Directors
determines that the offering of Guarantor Common Stock under the Demand
Registration Statement would be adversely affect or impact Purchaser\'s
Guarantor\'s ability to negotiate or complete a material financing, merger,
acquisition or other material    transaction or event involving
Purchaser\'s Guarantor or its subsidiaries that has not been publicly
disclosed or the unavailability of any required financial statements for
reasons substantially beyond the control of the Purchaser\'s Guarantor, (a
"Disadvantageous Condition"), Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall be entitled to
either suspend the effectiveness of the Demand Registration Statement with
the Commission or suspend the availability of the Demand Registration for
resales of Subject Securities by Holders, or may take both such actions, and
shall promptly notify all Holders thereof by delivery of written notice (a
"Suspension Notice"); provided, however, that Purchaser\'s
Guarantor\'s obligation to maintain the Demand Registration Statement current
under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be suspended by reason of Purchaser\'s
Guarantor\'s failure to disclose information at a time when public disclosure
of such information is required by law. Upon receipt of a Suspension Notice,
Holders shall immediately discontinue the use of the Demand Registration
Statement for any purpose until notified by Purchaser\'s Guarantor that the
Demand Registration Statement is current and available for use by Holders for
sales of Subject Securities. Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall not be entitled to
suspend the effectiveness of the Demand Registration Statement for more than
60 consecutive days or an aggregate of 120 days within any twelve-month
period and no subsequent suspension period shall occur unless at least 90
days have elapsed during which Sellers can utilize the Registration
Statement. As promptly as practicable after the public disclosure of such
Disadvantageous Condition or the Purchaser\'s Guarantor determines that the
Disadvantageous Condition no longer exists, Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall
amend or supplement the Demand Registration Statement to the extent necessary
to make the Demand Registration Statement current, and shall give prompt
written notice to all Holders when the Demand Registration Statement is again
available for resales of Subject Securities.   (v) If Purchaser\'s Guarantor
should undertake an underwritten public offering of its shares either after
the Demand Registration Statement has been declared effective or prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Sellers
shall, upon the request of the managing underwriter of such offering, agree
and commit, and it does hereby agree and commit, that it will not effect any
public sale or distribution, directly or indirectly, or make any offer to
sell, contract to sell (including without limitation any short sale), grant
any option to purchase or otherwise transfer or dispose (including sales
pursuant to Rule 144) of any of the Subject Securities, other than those
which are included in a Piggy-Back Registration, during a period of seven
days prior to and up to 180 days after the closing of such public offering
without the consent of the managing underwriter. This restriction shall not
apply to the offer and sale of any Subject Securities which may be covered by
the registration statement covering such public offering.   (vi)
Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall promptly notify all Holders of Subject
Securities of, and confirm in writing, the issuance by the Commission of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Demand Registration Statement
or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose. Purchaser\'s Guarantor
shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any order
suspending the effectiveness of the Demand Registration Statement at the
earliest possible time.   (vii) Purchaser\'s Guarantor will cause all of
the Subject Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which
similar securities issued by Purchaser\'s Guarantor are then listed no later
than the effective date of the Demand Registration Statement or Piggy-Back
Registration, as the case may be.     (c) Purchaser\'s Guarantor will
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, each of such Holder\'s officers,
directors, partners, or members, as the case may be, and each Person
controlling such Holder, with respect to which registration or qualification
of Subject Securities has been effected pursuant to this Section 10.1 against
all claims, losses, damages, and liabilities, joint or several (or actions in
respect thereof), arising out of or based upon any untrue statement (or
alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in the Demand
Registration Statement or Piggy-Back Registration, as the case may be,
prospectus, or offering circular, or in any document incorporated by
reference in any of the foregoing, or arising out of or based upon any
omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
or any violation by Purchaser\'s Guarantor of any rule or
regulation promulgated under the Securities Act applicable to Purchaser\'s
Guarantor and relating to action or inaction required of Purchaser\'s
Guarantor in connection with the Demand Registration or Piggy-Back
Registration, as the case may be and will promptly reimburse Holder and, each
of such Holder\'s officers, directors, partners, or members, as the case may
be, and each Person controlling such Holder, for any legal and any other
expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or defending
any such claims, loss, damage, liability or action; PROVIDED, however, that
Purchaser\'s Guarantor will not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense arises out of or is based
upon any untrue statement or omission based upon written information
furnished to Purchaser\'s Guarantor by such Holder specifically for inclusion
in any such registration statement, prospectus or offering circular. The
obligations of Purchaser\'s Guarantor under the foregoing indemnity agreement
shall survive the completion of the offering of Subject Securities under the
Demand Registration Statement or Piggy-Back Registration, as the case may
be.   (d) Each Holder with respect to which registration or qualification
of Subject Securities has been effected pursuant to this Section 10.1 will
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser\'s Guarantor, each of
Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s officers, directors, and each Person controlling
Purchaser\'s Guarantor, against all claims, losses, damages, and liabilities,
joint or several (or actions in respect thereof), arising out of or based
upon any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or offering circular, or
in any document incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing, or arising
out of or based upon any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or any violation by such Holder of any
rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or Exchange Act
applicable to such Holder and relating to action or inaction required of such
Holder in connection with any such registration or qualification, and will
promptly reimburse Purchaser\'s Guarantor, each of Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s
officers, directors, and each Person controlling Purchaser\'s Guarantor, for
any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending any such claims, loss, damage, liability or
action; PROVIDED, however, that such Holder will not be liable in any such
case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or expense
does not arise out of or is not based upon any untrue statement or omission
based upon written information furnished by such Holder specifically for
inclusion in any such registration statement, prospectus or offering
circular. The    obligations of Holders under the foregoing indemnity
agreement shall survive the completion of the offering of Subject Securities
under any registration statement provided for in this Section 10.1.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall any selling Holder be liable
for an amount in excess of the proceeds from the sale of the Subject
Securities realized by such Holder. Each Holder shall furnish in writing all
information to the Purchaser\'s Guarantor concerning itself and its holdings
of securities of the Purchaser\'s Guarantor as shall be required in
connection with the preparation and filing of any Registration Statement
covering any Subject Securities.   (e) All expenses incident to Purchaser\'s
Guarantor\'s performance of or compliance with this Section 10.1, including,
without limitation, all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of
compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including fees and disbursements
of counsel in connection with blue sky qualifications of the Subject
Securities), rating agency fees, printing expenses, messenger and delivery
expenses, internal expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and
expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting
duties), the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the
securities to be registered on the New York Stock Exchange and all securities
exchanges on which similar securities issued by Purchaser\'s Guarantor are
then quoted or listed, the fees and disbursements of counsel for Purchaser\'s
Guarantor and its independent certified public accountants (including the
expense of any special audit or comfort letters required by or incident to
such performance), securities act liability insurance (if Purchaser\'s
Guarantor elects to obtain such insurance), the fees and expenses of any
special experts retained by Purchaser\'s Guarantor in connection with such
registration, and fees and expenses of other Persons retained by Purchaser\'s
Guarantor, in connection with each registration hereunder (but not including
discounts, commissions, fees or expenses payable to underwriters that are
attributable to the Subject Securities offered on behalf of the Selling
Holder or to fees and expenses of counsel to the Selling Holder)
(collectively, the "Registration Expenses") will be borne by Purchaser\'s
Guarantor.   (f) Purchaser\'s Guarantor will also take such action as may
be required to be taken under applicable blue sky laws in connection with the
issuance of Guarantor Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and
in connection with resale of Subject Securities by Holders pursuant to the
Demand Registration Statement; PROVIDED that Purchaser\'s Guarantor will not
be required to become qualified as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction.   (g) (i) If, at any time during the period ending on
the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Purchaser\'s
Guarantor proposes to file a registration statement under the 1933 Act with
respect to an offering by the Purchaser\'s Guarantor for its own account or
for the account of any other Person of any class of equity security,
including any security convertible into or exchangeable for any equity
security (other than a registration statement on Forms S-4 or S-8 (or their
successor forms) or filed in connection with an exchange offer or an offering
of securities solely to the Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s existing stockholders,
and other than as set forth in (ii) below), then the Purchaser\'s Guarantor
shall in each case give written notice of such proposed filing to the Holders
of the Subject Securities at least twenty days before the anticipated filing
date, and such notice shall offer such Holders the opportunity to register
such number of Subject Securities as each such Holder may request (a "Piggy-
back Registration"). Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall use reasonable efforts to
cause the managing underwriter or    underwriters of a proposed
underwritten offering to permit the Holders of Subject Securities requested
to be included within such 20 days in the registration for such offering to
include such securities in such offering on the same terms and conditions as
any similar securities of the Purchaser\'s Guarantor included therein.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the managing underwriter or underwriters of
such offering advises to the Holders of Subject Securities that the total
amount of securities which they and any other Persons (other than the
Purchaser\'s Guarantor) intend to include in such offering is sufficiently
large to materially and adversely affect the success of such offering, then
the amount of Subject Securities to be offered in such event shall be
allocated first to the person on whose behalf the Registration Statement has
been filed, and then, to the extent that any additional securities can, in
the opinion of such managing underwriter or underwriters, be sold without any
such material adverse affect, pro rata among the Holders of
Subject Securities and all other selling stockholders named or proposed to be
named in the Piggy-Back Registration on the basis of the number of
outstanding shares of Purchaser\'s Guarantor common stock requested to be
included in such registration by each such Holder and other selling
stockholder to the amount recommended by such managing underwriter.   (ii)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Purchaser\'s Guarantor shall not be required to include Subject Securities in
any registration statement if the proposed registration is (A)a registration
of a stock option or other employee incentive compensation or employee
benefit plan or of securities issued or issuable pursuant to any such plan,
or a registration statement relating to warrants, options or shares
of capital stock granted or to be granted or sold primarily to employees,
directors or officers of the Purchaser\'s Guarantor, (B) a registration of
securities issued or issuable pursuant to a stockholder reinvestment plan or
other similar plan, (C) a registration of securities issued in exchange for
any securities or any assets of, or in connection with a merger or
consolidation with, an unaffiliated Purchaser\'s Guarantor, (D) a
registration of securities pursuant to a "rights" or other similar plan
designed to protect the Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s stockholders from a
coercive or other attempt to cause a change in control of Purchaser\'s
Guarantor, (E) registration of securities filed pursuant to Rule 145 under
the 1933 Act or any successor rule, or (F) a registration of
securities issued in connection with any debt or preferred stock financing of
Purchaser\'s Guarantor.   (iii) The Purchaser\'s Guarantor may withdraw
any registration statement and abandon any proposed offering initiated by
the Purchaser\'s Guarantor without the consent of any Holder of Subject
Securities, notwithstanding the request of any such Holder to participate
therein in accordance with this provision, if the Purchaser\'s Guarantor
determines in its sole discretion that such action is in the best interests
of the Purchaser\'s Guarantor and its stockholders (for this purpose, the
interest of the Holders shall not be considered).   ARTICLE XI 
DISPUTES   11.1 Dispute Resolution. Any controversy, claim or
dispute ("Dispute"), whether based on contract, tort, statute or other legal
or equitable theory (including but not limited to any claim of
fraud, misrepresentation or fraudulent inducement or any question of validity
or effect of this Agreement including this section) arising out of or related
to this Agreement (including any amendments or extensions), or the breach or
termination thereof, shall be settled    consultations between the
Parties initiated upon the written notice of any Party. In the event of
failure of such consultations to settle such Dispute in a manner acceptable
to all Parties within thirty (30) days following such written notice, then
such Dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with this
provision and the then current CPR Institute for Dispute Resolution Rules for
Non-Administered Arbitration of Business Disputes. The arbitration shall be
governed by the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16, to the
exclusion of any provision of state law inconsistent therewith or which would
produce a different result, and judgment upon the award rendered by
the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.   11.2
Place. The arbitration shall be held in New York, New York.   11.3
Arbitrators. There shall be three (3) independent and impartial arbitrators
of whom Sellers shall promptly appoint one (1), Purchaser shall promptly
appoint one (1), and the third of which shall be appointed by the two (2)
Party-appointed arbitrators in accordance with the arbitration rules. The
arbitrators shall determine the Dispute of the Parties and render a
final award in accordance with Section 11.1 hereof. The arbitrators shall set
forth the reasons for the award in writing.   11.4 Statute of Limitations.
Any Dispute by a Party shall be time-barred if the asserting Party does not
commence arbitration with respect to such Dispute within one (1) year after
the cause of action accrues. All statutes of limitations and defenses based
upon passage of time applicable to any Dispute of a defending Party
(including any counterclaim or setoff) shall be tolled while the arbitration
is pending.   11.5 Discovery. The arbitrator shall order the Parties to
promptly exchange copies of all exhibits and witness lists, and, if requested
by a Party, to produce other relevant documents, to answer up to ten (10)
interrogatories (including subparts), to respond to up to ten (10) requests
for admissions (which shall be deemed admitted if not denied) and to produce
for deposition and, if requested, at the hearing all witnesses that such
Party has listed and up to four (4) other persons within such Party\'s
control. Any additional discovery shall only occur by agreement of the
Parties or as ordered by the arbitrators upon a finding of good cause.  
11.6 Costs. Each Party shall bear its own costs, expenses and attorneys\'
fees; provided that if court proceedings to stay litigation or
compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully opposes such
proceedings shall pay all reasonable associated costs, expenses, and
attorneys\' fees in connection with such court proceeding.   11.7
Breach.   (a) The Parties recognize that irreparable injury will result
from a breach of any provision of this Agreement and that money damages will
be inadequate to fully remedy the injury. In order to prevent
such irreparable injury, the arbitrators shall have the power to grant
temporary or permanent injunctive or other equitable relief. Prior to the
appointment of the arbitrators a Party may, notwithstanding any other
provision of this    agreement, seek temporary injunctive relief from any
court of competent jurisdiction; provided that the Party seeking such relief
shall (if arbitration has not already been commenced) simultaneously commence
arbitration. Such court ordered relief shall not continue more than ten (10)
days after the appointment of the arbitrator (or in any event for longer than
sixty (60) days).   (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement to the contrary, upon any failure to Close the
transactions contemplated herein due to Purchaser\'s Guarantor\'s or
Purchaser\'s breach of their representations and warranties, due to the
failure of Purchaser\'s Guarantor or Purchaser to perform hereunder or due to
the failure for any reason to obtain the financing contemplated by the
Financing Commitments, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers promptly (and in no
event more than three Business days after receipt of Sellers\' written
notice) an amount equal to Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000.00), by way of
liquidated damages and not as a penalty. Such amount shall be payable in cash
by wire transfer to the Sellers\' account and such amount will not be due and
payable because of any failure or refusal by Sellers to exercise their rights
to elect under Section 2.5 to accept shares of Guarantor Common Stock as part
of the Purchase Price. Purchaser has provided to Sellers that certain standby
irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $30,000,000 issued by Fleet
National Bank N.A. for a term at least until May 1, 2003, a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit K (the "Letter of Credit"). If Sellers are
entitled to liquidated damages as provided herein, they shall give Purchaser
and Purchaser\'s Guarantor written notice of such fact and a demand for
payment thereof. If such amount of liquidated damages has not been paid to
Sellers within three (3) days after Purchaser\'s receipt of Sellers\' notice
and demand, Sellers shall be entitled to draw on the Letter of Credit
the full amount of the liquidated damages due hereunder.   (c)
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, upon
any failure to Close the transactions contemplated herein due to Sellers or
Sellers\' Guarantor\'s breach of their representations and warranties or
their failure to perform hereunder and, within twelve (12) months from the
date of this Agreement, Sellers shall have consummated a sale of the Assets
to a third party or the outstanding securities of Sellers are acquired by a
third party, Sellers shall pay to Purchaser promptly (and in no event more
than three Business days after receipt of Purchaser\'s written notice) an
amount equal to Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000.00), by way of liquidated
damages and not as a penalty. Such amount shall be payable either in cash by
wire transfer to the Purchaser\'s account.   11.8 Consent to Jurisdiction.
The Parties hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the state or
federal courts of New York for the enforcement of any award rendered by the
arbitrators.   ARTICLE XII  MISCELLANEOUS   12.1 Governing Law. This
Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
substantive law of the State of New York without giving effect to
the    principles of conflicts of law thereof, except that the substantive
law of Tennessee relating to the ownership of real property Assets located in
Tennessee shall govern with respect to such ownership.   12.2 Counterparts.

be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.   12.3 Assignment; Binding Effect. Neither this Agreement nor any

Parties, and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, arrangements
and representations between the Parties, written or oral, to the extent they

be deemed to    constitute a waiver by the Party taking such action of
compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement. The waiver by either Party of a breach of any
provision hereof shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior
or subsequent breach of the same or any other provisions hereof.   12.9

each Party in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be deemed an original, but all of which shall together

(a) Prior to Closing, Sellers agree to use reasonable business efforts to
obtain all consents to assignment of the Contracts, the Leases and Easements
and the Permits that are required to be obtained under this Agreement, even
though failure to obtain certain of the consents is not a condition precedent
to the Closing, except as provided for herein; provided, that neither Party
shall be obligated to make payments or incur obligations to third parties or
governmental agencies to obtain such consents except to pay such
Party\'s reasonable expenses or to pay normal fees to governmental
agencies.   (b) To the extent that any Contracts, Leases and Easements
or Permits that would otherwise be assigned under this Agreement are not
capable of being assigned, transferred, subleased or sublicensed without the
consent of, or waiver by, any other party thereto or any other Person, or if
such assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense or attempted assignment,
transfer, sublease or sublicense would constitute a breach thereof or a
violation of any Applicable Law, this Agreement shall not constitute an
assignment, transfer, sublease or sublicense, or an attempted assignment,
transfer, sublease or sublicense of any such Contract, Lease or Easement or
Permit. For a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after Closing,
Sellers shall continue to use their reasonable efforts to obtain a consent to
an assignment from Sellers to Purchaser of each Contract, each of the Leases
and Easements and Permits that, but for the first sentence of this Section,
would be assigned; provided, however, that Sellers shall not be required to

Purchaser and Purchaser\'s Guarantor (the "Parties").   RECITALS   A. The
Parties made and entered into that certain Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement
as of the 25th day of November 2002 and amended that agreement pursuant to a
First Amendment to Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement effective as of January
16, 2003 (such Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement, as amended, being
hereinafter referred to as the "Asset PSA").   B. The Parties now desire to
further amend the Asset PSA as set forth herein.   In consideration of the
matters set forth herein, the Parties agree that the Asset PSA is hereby
amended in the following particulars:     Capitalized terms used herein
shall have the same meaning as the defined terms in the Asset PSA.   1.
Crude Oil Acquired for March 2003 Deliveries. (a) Domestic Crude. With
respect to domestic barrels of crude oil for which Williams Refining and
Marketing, L.L.C. ("Seller") has entered into contracts with third parties
for deliveries into Capline pipeline during the month of March, 2003 (as
those barrels are described in Exhibits "A" and "B" hereto), the Parties
agree that such barrels will be purchased by Purchaser and sold by Seller
pursuant to the contracts attached hereto as Exhibits "A" and "B". Purchaser
agrees to provide credit support for such contracts consisting of an
irrevocable standby letter of credit in the amount of approximately $75
million and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "C".   (b) Foreign
Crude. With respect to foreign barrels of crude for which Seller has entered
into contracts with third parties and with Purchaser for deliveries into
Capline pipeline during the month of March 2003 (under which such contracts
Seller has neither prepaid for the crude nor acquired title thereto prior to
the Effective Time), the Parties agree as follows: (i) If such Seller
contracts are assignable (including those for which any necessary
prior consent has been obtained from the third party), such contracts (and
all rights and obligations arising thereunder) will be assigned to and
assumed by Purchaser upon the Closing; (ii) Such contracts for foreign crude
(if any) that are not assignable will be covered by a back-to-back contract
which Seller and Purchaser shall enter at Closing containing terms, including
price terms, that mirror, in all substantive respects, the terms and
conditions of the Seller contract applicable to that crude, with the
exception that Purchaser will be obligated to make payment for such barrels
in accordance with the payment terms under Seller\'s contract for such crude
but no earlier than at the time that title to such barrels transfers to
Purchaser via delivery of such barrels into Capline pipeline for Purchaser\'s
account. Purchaser further agrees, however, to provide credit support for
such contracts by, at Purchaser\'s option, (x) prepaying funds to Seller
directly or (y) providing an irrevocable standby letter of credit in the form
hereto as Exhibit C to cover each foreign contract at least two business days
prior to delivery into Capline pipeline for Purchaser\'s account. Promptly
upon receipt of Seller\'s invoice (and reasonable documentation of
such shipment for Purchaser\'s account), but in no event later than the first
business day following the receipt of such invoice, Purchaser shall make
payment for the applicable volumes of crude in accordance with such invoice
via wire transfer to Seller\'s account in accordance with the instructions
provided by Seller.   (c) True-up. With respect to volumes of crude
delivered under (a) above, the later of forty (40) days after Closing or the
date the final reconciliation between Williams and its domestic crude oil
suppliers have occurred, the Parties will true up for volume by grade, price
and any other adjustments allowed under the contract, all amounts paid. With
respect to volumes of crude delivered under (b)(ii) above within forty (40)
days after Closing, the Parties will true-up for volume by grade, price and
any other adjustments available under the contracts, all amounts paid. Any
payment required to be made pursuant to such true up shall be made by wire
transfer no later than five (5) days after such true up.   (d) Schedule
2.4(a). The Parties agree that Schedule 2.4(a) is hereby amended to provide
that the "pricing days" for valuing the Williams Feedstock Inventory and the
Williams Product   2    Inventory will be the day of Closing and the
first four (4) consecutive business days immediately following the Closing
Date. Each such business day used for pricing must be one for which the
applicable publication referenced in Schedule 2.4(a) publishes a price
quotation and the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") is open for normal
business and normal hours of business. In no event will a business day be
used as a pricing day if the applicable marker price referenced in Schedule
2.4(a) of the PSA is not published on that date or the NYMIEX is not open for
normal business and normal hours of business. The Parties agree that the
pricing of the Williams Feedstock Inventory and the Williams Product
Inventory must be completed within a fifteen (15) consecutive business day
pricing period immediately following Closing. If, during the fifteen (15) day
consecutive business days immediately following Closing there are at
least three (3) pricing days, the Parties agree to use the average of the
pricing days achieved to value the Inventory. If, during the fifteen (15.)
consecutive business days immediately following Closing, there are not at
least three (3) pricing days, the Parties agree that the determination of the
fair market values of the Inventory will be resolved pursuant to the
provisions of the Dispute Resolution provisions of Article XI of the Asset
PSA.   2. Oracle Licenses. With respect to Oracle licenses that are used at
the Assets, Sellers have provided notice to Purchaser of Sellers\'
election under Section 6.15 of the Asset PSA to retain such Oracle licenses.
The Parties hereby agree that Sellers are to refrain from all efforts to
obtain replacement Oracle licenses for Purchasers without further written
direction from Purchaser pursuant to the terms of the Asset PSA.   3.
Exchange Balances. The definition of "Williams Product Inventory" is hereby
amended to exclude any exchange imbalances. Purchaser and Sellers agree that
Sellers will cash settle all exchange balances for the periods prior to the
Closing Date so that the exchange agreements assigned to Purchaser at Closing
will have -0- balances.   4. Forward Hedges of Heating Oil. Purchaser and
Sellers agree that Sellers will cash settle the corresponding NYMEX long
future hedges associated with the remaining firm price distillate sales that
are described in pages 10-12 of Schedule 4.5 of the PSA in which the Sellers
have not delivered the contracts and which the Purchaser will assume the
delivery obligations of the contracts. Such cash settlement will be
determined as set forth in the "Cash Settlement of Outstanding Futures"
schedule attached hereto (which assumes a Closing Date of Monday, March 3,
2003). If, on Closing Date, the price of NYMEX heating oil contracts are
greater than the price of the corresponding April and May NYMEX heating oil
contracts described in pages 10-12 of Schedule 4.5 of the PSA, the total
value difference shall be applied at Closing to decrease the Final Inventory
Amounts. If, on the Closing Date, the price of NYMEX heating oil contracts
are less than the price of the corresponding April and May NYMEX heating oil
contracts described in pages 10-12 of Schedule 4.5 of the PSA, the total
value difference shall be applied at Closing to increase the Final Inventory
Amounts.   5. Peaking Power Plant. The Parties agree that there will be
a separate Closing for the transfer of Sellers\' interest in Williams
Generating Memphis, L.L.C. and Williams Power Marketing, LLC in recognition
of the need for prior FERC approval before the ownership of Williams
Generating Memphis, L.L.C. may be transferred to Purchaser. Such Closing
shall occur within five (5) calendar days following the day that public
notice of such transfer approval by FERC has been   3    given. Such
separate Closing will not reduce or affect the Closing Purchase Price
required to be paid under Section 2.2(b) of the Asset PSA. Sellers
will provide Purchaser with the economic benefit of Williams Generating
Memphis, LLC and Williams Power Marketing until such separate Closing.
Sellers and Purchaser agree that the Assets owned by Williams Generating
Memphis, L.L.C. and Williams Power Marketing, LLC shall be governed by such
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements and indemnities as may
apply (and to the extent of such application) under the Asset PSA to the same
extent as if such Assets were to be transferred to Purchaser instead of the
transfer of the ownership interest to Purchaser of Williams Generating
Memphis, L.L.C. and Williams Power Marketing, LLC. Such separate Closing
shall not constitute a waiver or forfeiture of any rights and remedies that
Purchaser may have under the terms of the Asset PSA.   6. Schedule 4.13(a) -
Description of Real Property. Schedule 4.13(a) is hereby superseded and
replaced in its entirety by the attached First Amended Schedule 4.13(a).  
7. 330,000 Barrel Storage Tank at St. James. The Parties hereby confirm the
provisions of Sections 6.19 and 7.2(d) of the Asset PSA with respect to the
referenced storage tank and the related surface lease and pipeline servitude
and tank operating agreements. If the necessary consents for
Sellers\' transfer of the tank and the related tank operating agreement and
surface lease and pipeline servitude agreement have not been obtained before
Closing, Sellers will provide Purchaser with the economic benefit of such
tankage and such agreements until such consents are obtained. Unless
otherwise agreed, such economic benefit will be on a pass-through basis, with
such costs as are actually incurred in connection with the ownership of the
tank and pursuant to the terms of the lease and tank operating agreement. In
the event that any of the provisions of the underlying land lease or tank
operating agreement are proposed to be changed, Sellers shall review the
proposed changes with Purchaser with Sellers first obtaining Purchasers
consent to any increase in costs or change in a material term. At Closing,
the Parties will execute an agreement that is consistent with the foregoing
and it substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "D."   8. Form
of Special Warranty Deed. The form of special warranty deed (Exhibit B to the
Asset PSA) upon which the Parties have agreed is attached hereto as Exhibit
"E".   9. Section 6.2(m). Section 6.2(m) of the Asset PSA concerns
the maintenance and capital projects described in Schedule 6.2(m) and the
Parties have entered into a separate Low Sulfur Gasoline Project Agreement.
The Parties recognize that certain of these maintenance and capital project
matters, as reflected on Exhibit "F\' hereto, will not have been completed at
the time of Closing and do hereby agree to resolve and settle all of those
matters through the payment to Purchaser, via Purchase Price adjustment at
Closing, of the sum of $41,048.00 as calculated on Exhibit "F." Purchaser
agrees that, subject to such Purchase Price adjustment being made at Closing
and Sellers\' payments of invoices attributable to the period prior to
Closing, Sellers have fully performed and satisfied their obligations under
Section 6.2(m) and Sellers agree that Purchaser has fully performed and
satisfied its obligations under the Low Sulfur Gasoline Project Agreement up
to and including the Closing Date.   10. Casualty/Unfinished Items. Exhibit
"G" hereto sets forth the following five items ("Items"): Two casualty
incidents at the Memphis refinery which occurred after November 25, 2002
(Items 1 and 2), one unfinished project involving removal and disposition of
tank waste (Item 3), and   4    two real property matters (Items 4 and
5). Because repairs and actions related to these items will not be completed
until after the Closing, the Parties have agreed to escrow specified amounts
for each Item, the sum of which equals $2.7 million, pursuant to the escrow
agreement attached hereto as Exhibit "G-1." The Parties agree to handle these
Items as follows:   (a) Items 1, 2 and 5. The Parties shall endeavor in
good faith to agree upon commercially reasonable approaches (including the
cost thereof) to repairing or completing each one of these Items. If the
Parties are unable to reach such agreement on any one or more of these Items,
such disagreement(s) will be resolved pursuant to the Dispute Resolution
provisions of Article XI. The agreed-upon repair or completion approach shall
be conducted or managed by the Purchaser who shall provide prompt notice to
Sellers of completion, including detail cost support for the repairs and
other actions taken. When an Item has been repaired or completed pursuant to
the Parties\' agreed-upon repair or completion approach, any escrowed amounts
attributable to that Item over and above the actual repair or completion cost
shall be promptly released to Sellers.   (b) Items 3 and 4. Sellers shall,
in satisfaction of Item 3, ship and dispose of the 25 roll-off boxes
currently located at the Memphis refinery resulting from completion of the
asphalt tank cleaning project. Purchaser will provide Sellers with reasonable
assistance in effectuating such shipment from the refinery premises. When
Sellers have completed such shipment, the escrowed amount applicable to Item
3 will be promptly paid to Sellers. Item 4 concerns the Capline Connection
Agreement, dated August 6, 1984, between the Capline Owners and Mid-America
Pipeline Company (the "Connection Agreement"), the Pipeline and Meter Station
Easement, dated February 14, 1985, between Shell Pipe Line Corporation and
Mid-America Pipeline Company (the "Easement"), 18 pipeline easements located
along the Collierville pipeline that are to be transferred to The Premcor
Pipeline Company (the "Pipeline Easements"), and the Surface Lease and
Pipeline Servitude and the Tank Operating Agreement, both dated December 1,
1996, between Shell Pipe Line Corp. and Mapco Petroleum Inc., now known as
Williams Express, Inc. (the "Capline Agreements"). With respect to the
Pipeline Easements, the Easement, the Connection Agreement and the
Capline Agreements, Sellers will use their best efforts to cause such
agreements or other easements, contracts or property interests providing
substantially similar benefits to vest in The Premcor Pipeline Company. Upon
completion of Item 4, the monies remaining in escrow with respect to such
item will be promptly paid to Sellers.   (c) Limitations on Liability.
Sellers shall have no liability to Purchaser in connection with any one of
Items 1, 2 or 3 over and above the amount allocated thereto in accordance
with Exhibit "G". The amounts allocated on Exhibit "G" with respect to Items
4 and 5 are good faith estimates by the Parties of the maximum amounts that
will have to be expended to accomplish Items 4 and 5 in a commercially
reasonable fashion. Except as provided for in this Second Amendment, for the
respective escrow amounts allocated to these Items on Exhibit "G," this
paragraph 10 of this Second Amendment does not create rights or remedies over
and above any that may already exist under the Asset PSA; nor does this
Second Amendment limit or impair any such rights or remedies that may exist
under the terms of the Asset PSA upon Closing.   11. Inventory Estimate
Adjustment. The parties agree to reduce the Inventory Estimate of
$167,660,020.74 provided by Sellers to Purchaser on February 24, 2003 by the
amount of $22,862,500 in order to exclude from Inventory a Saharan Blend
crude oil cargo that will now be   5    arriving after the Effective
Time. The adjusted Inventory Estimate is therefore $144,797,520.74.   13.
Off-Spec Propylene/Propane Product. Purchaser agrees to buy and Seller agrees
to sell approximately 20 full rail cars of off-spec propylene/propane mix
product located on Real Property on the Closing Date. The Parties agree that
the price for this product shall be determined in accordance with the method
of determination in Schedule 2.4(a) of the Asset PSA for propylene/propane
mix minus 7 cents per gallon. The value of this product shall be included in
the Final Inventory Amount and shall be subject to the Inventory adjustment
and dispute resolution procedures of Section 2.4 of the Asset PSA.   14.
Revised Schedules. Schedule 4.3(a) is hereby superseded and replaced in its
entirety by the attached First Amended Schedule 4.3(a). Schedule 4.6(a) is
hereby superseded and replaced in its entirety by the attached First Amended
Schedule 4.6(a). Schedule 4.6(b) is hereby superseded and replaced in its
entirety by the attached First Amended Schedule 4.6(b). Schedule 4.6(c)
is hereby superseded and replaced in its entirety by the attached First
Amended Schedule 4.6(c).   15. Brent vs. WTI Differential for Inventory
Valuation. The parties agree that Brent crude oil included in Inventory shall
be priced at the NYMEX WTI price minus $0.50 per barrel at St. James. The
Brent price at any other location shall be adjusted with the applicable
transportation differential as specified in the Asset PSA.   16.
Closing/Effective Time. The parties agree that the Effective Time of the
Closing shall be 12:01 A.M. CST on March 3, 2003.   [THE BALANCE OF THIS
