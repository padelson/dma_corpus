parties to the Merger Agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger
Agreement instead of establishing such matters as facts); and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third party beneficiaries under the
Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any description thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of Brightpoint, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in
public disclosures by Brightpoint and Parent. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="right"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>Execution Copy </B></FONT></P>
