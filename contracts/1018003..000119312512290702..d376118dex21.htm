Exhibit 2.1

The Merger Agreement has been attached as an exhibit in order to provide
information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other
factual information about Brightpoint, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
subsidiaries and affiliates. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of
that agreement and as of specific dates; were solely for the benefit of
the parties to the Merger Agreement; may be subject to limitations agreed
upon by the contracting parties (including being qualified by confidential
disclosures made for the purpose of allocating contractual risk between the
parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing such matters as
facts); and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the
contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors
are not third party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not
rely on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, or any
description thereof, as characterizations of the actual state of facts or
condition of Brightpoint, Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject
matter of the representations and warranties may change after the date of the
Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully

 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 29, 2012 (this " _Agreement_
"), by and among Ingram Micro Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Beacon Sub, Inc., an Indiana corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary
of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Brightpoint, Inc., an Indiana corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ")
has (i) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and the
shareholders of the Company to enter into this Agreement with Parent and
Merger Sub providing for the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Sub with and
into the Company in accordance with the Indiana Business Corporation Law of
the State of Indiana (the " _IBCL_ "), upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein and (ii) adopted this Agreement in accordance with
the IBCL; 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of each of Parent and Merger Sub has (i)
determined that it is in the best interests of the stockholders of Parent and
the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, respectively, and declared it advisable
for Parent and Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement and (ii)
approved this Agreement in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware and the IBCL, respectively; and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the IBCL, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of Article
VII, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Blank Rome LLP, 405 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00
a.m. local time, on the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted by Applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (excluding conditions that by their terms cannot be satisfied
until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of those
conditions). The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." At the Closing, the parties hereto shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing articles of merger (the "
_Articles of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana,
in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the IBCL  and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the IBCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Articles of Merger
are filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Indiana or at such
later time (or subsequent date and time) as Parent and the Company shall agree
and specify in the Articles of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger
becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective
Time_."

Section 1.3 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth herein and in the applicable provisions of the IBCL, including Section
23-1-40-6 of the IBCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 1.4 _Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall
be amended so that they read in their entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_
annexed hereto, and, as so amended, shall be the articles of incorporation of
the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their
terms and as provided by Applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company or Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be restated so that
they read in their entirety as set forth in  _Exhibit B_ annexed hereto,
and, as so restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended or restated in accordance with their terms, the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and as provided by law.

Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office until
their successors are duly appointed and qualified, or until their earlier
death, resignation or removal.

 

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holders of any of the following securities:

(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock (" _Shares_
") to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c), shall be converted into the right to receive Nine Dollars ($9.00) in
cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ ")

 



2  payable to the holder thereof, without interest, in the manner provided in
Section 2.3. All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist. If, between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, there is a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
stock dividend, subdivision, combination or exchange of shares with respect
to, or rights issued in respect of, Shares, the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted accordingly, without duplication, to provide to the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event;

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by
Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall be canceled and shall cease to
exist without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be
made with respect thereto;

 

(c) Each Share held by any direct or indirect subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into such number of shares of stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that each such subsidiary owns the same percentage of the
outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such subsidiary owned of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and

(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.2 _Stock Options, Restricted Shares, RSUs and RSAs_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding option to
purchase Shares (a " _Company Stock Option_ ") granted under any director,
consultant or employee stock option or compensation plan or arrangement of the
Company (collectively, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether or not vested
or exercisable, shall be converted into the right to receive, and the Company
shall pay to each former holder of any such converted Company Stock Option, at
or promptly after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product
of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration, as provided in
Section 2.1(a), over the applicable exercise price per Share of such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of Shares such holder could have purchased
had such holder exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted
Share granted under any Company Stock Plan (a " _Company Restricted Share_ ")
shall be converted into the right to receive, and the Company shall pay to
each holder of any such Company Restricted Share, at or promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration, as
provided in Section 2.1(a), for each such Company Restricted Share.

 



3 (c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted
stock unit (" _RSU_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive, and the
Company shall pay to each holder of any such RSU, at or promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each
such RSU (which payment shall be deemed to be the issuance of the appropriate
number of Shares and receipt of the Merger Consideration, as provided in
Section 2.1(a), to the extent required by the terms of the applicable RSU
agreement). Parent understands and acknowledges that all RSUs will become
fully vested at or immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-outstanding restricted
stock award (" _RSA_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive, and the
Company shall pay to each holder of any such RSA, at or promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration for each
such RSA (which payment shall be deemed to be the issuance of the appropriate
number of Shares and receipt of the Merger Consideration, as provided in
Section 2.1(a), to the extent required by the terms of the applicable RSA
agreement).

(e) Unless a later time for payment is expressly provided in this Section
2.2, the Company shall pay the holders of Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares, RSUs and RSAs the cash payments described in this Section
2.2 promptly after the Effective Time, but in any event not later than the
first regular payroll date for the Company that occurs after the Effective
Time.

Section 2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with the
Companys transfer agent (or other suitable financial institution reasonably
satisfactory to the Company) pursuant to which such agent (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") shall agree to exchange the Merger Consideration for Shares that
have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration to
which the shareholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to
Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section
2.1. Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent,
_provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and
following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the
Paying Agent for the benefit of the shareholders of the Company in the amount
of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term
obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than
30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America. Any interest or income
produced by such investments shall be payable to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as directed by Parent.

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the fourth Business Day following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding certificate or outstanding certificates ("
_Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding Shares, which have converted into the right to receive

 



4  the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a), a
letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
held by such person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificate and such Certificate shall then
be canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the fourth Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") a check or wire transfer for the amount
of cash that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in
respect of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that such
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in
proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly
transferred and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid
any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company ("
_DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the
Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day
after the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal
to the DTC Payment.

(d) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective
Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) that have
been made available to the Paying Agent and that have not been disbursed to
holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders
shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors
thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of
their Certificates and Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Shares for 

 



5  any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all
charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with
the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
transfer, such Certificates shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under applicable Tax laws. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

(g) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements
established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the
holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect
of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) The Company and its subsidiaries have all permits, licenses,
authorizations, exemptions, orders, consents, approvals and franchises ("
_Licenses_ ") from Governmental Entities required to conduct their respective
businesses as now being conducted, except for any such Licenses the absence of
which would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect. All Licenses of the Company are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective directors, officers, agents, employees or any other persons acting
on their behalf has, at any time during the last five years, in connection
with the operation of their respective businesses, (i) used any corporate or

Adverse Effect.

 

(e) This Section 3.6 does not relate to employee benefit matters, which are
the subject of Section 3.10, or Taxes, which are the subject of Section 3.14.

Section 3.7 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports,
statements, certifications and other documents (together with all exhibits,
amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since January 1, 2010 (all
such forms, reports, statements, certificates and other documents filed since
January 1, 2010, collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ "). Each of the SEC
Reports, when filed (or, with respect to any SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, as amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof,
if applicable), complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
_Securities Act_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the
case may be, each as in effect on the date so filed. None of the SEC Reports
contained, when filed (or, with respect to any SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, as amended or supplemented prior to the date hereof, if
applicable), any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each SEC Report that
is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed
pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement became effective, did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated or
incorporated by reference therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading.

 

(b) The financial statements (including all related notes and schedules) of
the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries included in the SEC Reports
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the
respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) and were prepared in all
material respects in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, as permitted by the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be expressly indicated therein or in the
notes thereto), except in each case to the extent that such information has
been amended or superseded by later SEC Reports filed prior to the date
hereof.

 



11 (c) Since January 1, 2010, the Company has been and is in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and (ii) the applicable listing and
corporate governance rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer by
others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective in all material respects in
timely alerting the Companys principal executive officer and principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act. The Company and
its subsidiaries have established and maintained a system of internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and
the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP.

(e) The Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer prior to the
date hereof, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company
Board (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud, to the knowledge of the Company,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to, or has
any commitment to become a party to, any securitization transaction or off-
balance sheet arrangement (as defined in Item 303 of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act).

(g) Except (i) as reflected, accrued or reserved against in the Companys
consolidated balance sheet (or the notes thereto) included in the Companys
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed prior to the date hereof for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2011 and since the date of the most recent financial
statements included in the SEC Reports, (ii) for liabilities or obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the most recent
financial statements included in the SEC Reports, (iii) for liabilities or
obligations which have been discharged or paid in full prior to the date
hereof and (iv) for liabilities or obligations incurred pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities, commitments or obligations, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, absolute or contingent, whether or not accrued,
matured or un-matured or otherwise, other than those which have not had,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 



12 Section 3.8 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. From the date of the
most recent financial statements included in the SEC Reports through the date
hereof, the Company and its subsidiaries have conducted their business in all
material respects in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, except
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
and since such date, there has not been: (a) any change, event or occurrence
which has had a Material Adverse Effect or (b) any action taken by the Company
or any of its subsidiaries that, if taken during the period from the date
hereof through the Effective Time without Parents consent, would constitute a
breach of Section 5.1.

Section 3.9 _Absence of Litigation_. There are no suits, claims, actions,
arbitrations, mediations or other proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, other
than any such suit, claim, action, arbitration, mediation or other proceeding
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. As of the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties is or are subject to any
order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or award, except for those that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
There have not been, since January 1, 2010, nor are there currently any
internal investigations or inquiries being conducted by the Company, the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) or any third party at the request of
any of the foregoing concerning any financial, accounting, tax, conflict of
interest, self-dealing, fraudulent or deceptive conduct or other misfeasance
or malfeasance issues, except for those that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

Section 3.10 _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, each Company Plan has been established and administered in
accordance with its terms and in compliance with the applicable provisions of
ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), and other
Applicable Law, rules and regulations.

 

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,

contribute to any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or
any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, with respect to each Company Plan, as of the date hereof, no
actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the
ordinary course) are pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened.

(d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect, (i) the Company has not incurred any liability under Title IV
of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full and (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, no condition exists that presents a risk to the Company of incurring
any such liability other than liability for premiums due to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

 



13 (e) Each Company Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a determination or opinion letter to that effect
from the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
circumstances exist which would reasonably be expected to materially adversely
affect such qualification or exemption.

discussions or negotiations, if any, with any person and its Representatives

The Company shall promptly request that each person other than Parent, if any,
that has executed a confidentiality agreement within the 24-month period prior

practicable.

the Company and its Representatives may provide non-public information and
data concerning the Company and its subsidiaries in

 



26  response to a request therefor by or on behalf of such person to such
person, its outside counsel, financial advisor(s), lenders or other financing
sources and/or potential divestiture counterparties, so long as the Company
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on customary
terms (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not
prohibit the making or amendment of an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise
contain any standstill or similar provision); _provided_ that the Company
shall promptly make available to Parent and Merger Sub any material non-public
information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries that the Company
made available to any person given such access which was not previously made
available to Parent or Merger Sub (unless precluded by Applicable Law), (ii)
the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any

counterparties and (iii) the Company Board may authorize, adopt, approve,
recommend, or otherwise declare advisable or propose to authorize, adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) such an
Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (1) the receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of this Section 6.4, (2)
prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company
Board determines in good faith that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, (3)
in each such case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, the Company Board
has determined in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and the Financial Advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, and (4) in the case referred to in clause (iii) above, the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and the Financial Advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal.

(d)  _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person or group of persons other than Parent or one of its subsidiaries for
(A) a merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving an acquisition of the Company (or any subsidiary or
subsidiaries of the Company whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole), (B) the acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, of over
15% of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and
its subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger or (C) a transaction or
series of transactions which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any
of the foregoing transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide, unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal for at least a majority of the outstanding Shares or all
or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries that the Company Board has determined in its good faith
judgment, after consultation with and considering the advice of its outside
legal counsel and the Financial Advisor, (A) is reasonably likely to be
consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into account all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the person making the
proposal, and (B) if consummated, would result in a transaction superior to
the Company than 

 



27  the transactions contemplated hereby (after giving effect to all of the
adjustments which may be offered by Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to Section
6.4(h) and taking into account break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions and conditions to consummation).

(e) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
Except as set forth in this Section 6.4(e), Section 6.4(f), or Section 8.3(a),
the Company Board shall not:

(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation with respect to the Merger (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ "), it being understood that the Company Board may take no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business
as of the tenth Business Day after the commencement of such Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act without such action
being considered an adverse modification; or

(ii) except as expressly permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the
Company to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in
Section 6.4(a) or Section 6.4(c)) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or
otherwise restrict the Company Board from making a Change of Recommendation
following a termination of this Agreement pursuant to, and in accordance with
the terms of, Section 8.3(a).

 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board from (i) complying
with its disclosure obligations under Applicable Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to shareholders), in each case
so long as any action taken or statement made to so comply is consistent with
this Section 6.4, and provided that in the case of any such action that is
taken or statement made that relates to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board shall, upon written request by Parent, publicly reaffirm the Company
Recommendation within three Business Days of such request (if the Company
Recommendation was not already reaffirmed in such statement or in connection
with such action) or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to
the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under
the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the shareholders of the
Company).

(g) _Notice_. From and after the date hereof, the Company agrees that it will
promptly (and, in any event, within three Business Days) notify Parent if any
proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by,
any non-public information is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, it or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of
any written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements,
redacted, if necessary, to remove the identity of the

 



28  person making the proposal or offer or to comply with confidentiality
obligations to such person) and thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status and terms of any such proposals or offers (including
any amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

(h)  _Notification of Certain Actions_. The Company shall not be entitled to
take any of the actions described in Section 6.4(c)(iii) or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) with respect to a Superior Proposal
unless (i) the Company has provided notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_
") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, describing the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
such action, and, if applicable, provides copies of all documents relating
thereto (it being understood that such material terms need not include the
identity of the person making such proposal), (ii) during the 48-hour period
following Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good
faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal
ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii) at the end of such 48-hour
period Parent has not made a written offer of changes to this Agreement, in
response to the Notice of Superior Proposal or otherwise, that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be at least as favorable to
the Company as the Superior Proposal. Any material amendment to the financial
terms or any other material amendment of such Superior Proposal shall require
a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall be required to comply
again with the requirements of this Section 6.4(h); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that references to the 48-hour period above shall be deemed to be references
to a 24-hour period.

Section 6.5 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters_. 

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its subsidiaries to maintain, until December 31, 2012 (or, if later, the
Closing Date), the severance-related provisions of the Company Plans existing
immediately prior to the Effective Time and to provide 100% of the severance
payments and benefits provided thereunder to be delivered to any Company
Employee.

(b) Without limiting any additional rights that any Company Employee may have
under any Company Plan, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each
of its subsidiaries to maintain for any Company Employee who remains employed,
subject to paragraph (a) above, (i) until the later of (x) December 31, 2012
and (y) the Closing Date, compensation levels (such term to include salary and
target incentive compensation in the aggregate) that are no less favorable
than those provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) for twelve months following the Effective Time,
health and welfare benefits and retirement benefits that in the aggregate are
substantially comparable to the overall health and welfare benefits, and
retirement benefits maintained for and provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, give Company Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation, 

 



29  vesting, severance and benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit
accruals under any defined benefit pension plans, except to the extent such
plan or plans provide for past service credit, or to the extent this credit
would result in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service),
under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including
vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for
the benefit of Company Employees as of and after the Effective Time by
Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Company
Employees service with the Company, its subsidiaries and their predecessor
entities (each, a " _Parent Plan_ ") to the same extent recognized by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as contemplated by this
Agreement. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a "welfare benefit plan"
(as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, regardless as to whether or not such
Parent Plan is subject to ERISA), Parent or its subsidiaries shall (i) cause
there to be waived any pre-existing condition or eligibility limitations and
(ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket
limitations, to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed
to, Company Employees under similar plans maintained by the Company and its
subsidiaries in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(d) From and after the Effective Time, subject to the actions contemplated in
Sections 2.2 and 6.5 hereof, Parent will honor, and will cause its
subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing
employment, change in control, severance and termination protection plan,
policy or agreement of or between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and
any officer, director or employee of that company, (ii) all bonus plans or
programs and (iii) all obligations pursuant to outstanding restoration plans,
bonus plans or programs, bonus deferral plans, vested and accrued benefits
under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Company or its
subsidiaries and similar employment compensation and benefit arrangements and
agreements in effect as of the date hereof, in each case to the
extent legally binding on the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

(e) (i) No more than thirty days prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall have the right, in its sole option and discretion, to terminate each
Agreement for Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefits entered into by and
between the Company and certain of its executive officers, each of which is
set forth in Section 6.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (each a "
_Retirement Agreement_ " and collectively the " _Retirement Agreements_ "), in
a manner that meets the requirements of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B),
and shall liquidate all benefits payable under such Retirement Agreements by
paying to each such executive officer the present value, using reasonable
actuarial factors, of the benefit accrued under his Retirement Agreement
as of the date of such termination, provided that such terminations and
liquidations shall occur only if all of such executive officers party to a
Retirement Agreement consent thereto. (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
the Company does not terminate the Retirement Agreements prior to the
Effective Time, Parent hereby expressly agrees that, from and after the
Effective Time, it will cause the Surviving Corporation (and/or Parents
subsidiaries, as applicable) to assume and agree to perform in the same
manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if
the Merger had not taken place, each Retirement Agreement in effect as of the
Effective Time.

 



30 (f) Nothing in this Section shall give any person any third-party beneficiary
right, amend any Company Plan or other employee agreement, or operate to
supersede or conflict with any collective bargaining arrangement.

 

(g) If directed in writing by Parent at least ten (10) days prior to Closing,
the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans prior to the Closing,
pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board reasonably satisfactory to
Parent.

Section 6.6  _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any employment agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the
sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each
present (as of the Effective Time) and former officer and director of the
Company and its subsidiaries and any employee or agent of the Company serving
as an officer or director of another entity at the request of the Company
and identified in Section 6.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact
that an Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director or is or was
serving at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries as a director
or officer of another entity or (ii) matters existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and
actions contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable
Law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any
such matter.

(b) The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and
officers than are presently set forth in the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time, to obtain and fully pay the premium for a "tail" policy extension of (i)
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies, and (ii) the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (collectively, " _D
andO Insurance"_) with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect
to any actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act,
omission, neglect, breach

 



31  of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such capacity
that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ that if the aggregate premium for such "tail" policy
exceeds 300% of the per annum rate of premium paid by the Company as of the
date hereof, then the Company (or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable)
shall procure the maximum coverage that will then be available with the
expenditure of 300% of such rate. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" policy as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are at least as favorable as provided in the Companys existing policies as of
the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, use reasonable best efforts to purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that in
satisfying its obligation under this Section 6.6(c), the Surviving Corporation
shall not be obligated to pay an aggregate premium in excess of 300% of the
per annum rate of premium paid by the Company as of the date hereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions and benefits of this
Section 6.6 shall continue in full effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

(e) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and
legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise.

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.6. In addition, the Surviving
Corporation shall not distribute, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section
6.6.

Section 6.7 _Further Action; Efforts_.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be

under any Antitrust Law) to consummate the transactions contemplated

 



32  hereby as soon as practicable and (ii) do all things necessary, proper or
advisable under Applicable Law and regulations to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby at the earliest practicable date,

EU Merger Regulation or any other Antitrust Law) and duly make all
notifications and other filings required under the HSR Act, the EU
Merger Regulation or any other Antitrust Law and; (B) using reasonable best
efforts to resolve any objection asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law raised by any Governmental Entity.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 6.7(a),
each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
practicable an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other appropriate filings pursuant to the EU Merger
Regulation or any other Antitrust Law. Each of the Company and Parent shall
bear its respective expenses, charges and filing fees associated with the
filings by the Company and Parent required under the HSR Act, the EU Merger
Regulation or any other Antitrust Law.

 

(c) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby then such party shall in good faith make, or
cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation
with the other party, a response which is, at a minimum, in substantial
compliance with such request.

(d) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the approvals of or clearances from
each applicable Governmental Entity, including:

by any party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities and
as to the contents of all communications with such Governmental Entities. In
particular, to the extent permitted by law or Governmental Entity, no party
will make any notification in relation to the transactions contemplated
hereby without first providing the other party with a copy of such
notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account
of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect;

connection with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Law; and

 

(v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, and subject to
Section 6.7(e)(iv), consulting and cooperating in all respects with the other

Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Section
6.7 shall require either Parent or any of its subsidiaries to: (i) agree to
or to effect any divestiture of, or hold separate (including by establishing a
trust or otherwise), or agree to restrict its ownership or operation of, any
business or assets of the Company or its subsidiaries or of Parent or its
subsidiaries, or to enter into any settlement or consent decree, or agree to

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in
any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.5 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Confidentiality
Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of
law or otherwise without the prior written consent of each of the other
parties.

Section 9.6  _Parties in Interest_. Except (i) as provided in Section 6.6 and
(ii) only with respect to shareholders and only after the Effective Time, for
the provisions set forth in Article II, Parent and the Company hereby agree
that their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth
herein are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance
with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not
intended to, and does not, confer upon any person other than the parties
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein. The parties hereto further
agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under Section 6.6 shall
not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies
in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with Section 8.8 without notice or liability to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in
this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date hereof or as
of any other date.

 



47 Section 9.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Indiana (without
giving effect to choice of law principles thereof).

 

Section 9.8 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile, ".pdf," or other electronic transmission) in one or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

Section 9.10  _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not
perform the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such
actions as are required hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of this Agreement and to
specifically enforce the terms hereof, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that (i) the
other party has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.
Furthermore, each of the parties hereto agrees to waive any requirement for
the security or posting of any bond in connection with a remedy for specific
performance. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically
the obligations of Parent and the Merger Sub to consummate the Closing in the
event that all conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have
been satisfied (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing
and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) at the time Section 1.2 contemplates the Closing to
occur. To the extent any party hereto brings an action, suit or proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (other than an action to specifically enforce any provision that
expressly survives termination of this Agreement) when expressly available to
such party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Termination Date shall
automatically be extended to (i) the twentieth Business Day following the
resolution of such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, suit or proceeding.

 

Section 9.11 _Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of the federal court located in the
Southern District of Indiana or of any state court located in Marion County,
Indiana, in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby in any court other
than the federal court located in the Southern District of Indiana or a state
court located in Marion County, Indiana and (d) consents to service

 



48  being made through the notice procedures set forth in Section 9.2. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 9.2 shall be effective service of process for
any suit or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 9.12 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement.
The word "or" shall not be exclusive. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting or causing any instrument to be
drafted.

 

Section 9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT OR THE
COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT THEREOF.
