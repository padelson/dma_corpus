  Stock, certificates (if such shares shall be certificated) representing shares
  of CVS Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.04 in exchange for outstanding
  shares of Caremark Stock and (y) make available to the Exchange Agent, as needed,

  From and after the Effective Time, the Caremark Employee Plans and the CVS
  Employee Plans in effect at the Effective Time will remain in effect (except
  as provided in Section 2.06) with respect to employees and former employees
  of Caremark or CVS and their Subsidiaries, as applicable, and the dependents
  of such employees covered by such plans at the Effective Time (the &#147;<B>Covered Employees</B>&#148;),
  until such time as CVS otherwise determines, subject to applicable law, the
  terms of such plans and this Section 8.18. Prior to the Effective Time, Caremark
  and CVS acting in good faith will cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing
  the Caremark Employee Plans and the CVS Employee Plans with a view towards
  developing appropriate employee benefit and compensation plans, programs and
  arrangements for Covered Employees after the Effective Time which, among other
  things, (i) will treat similarly situated Covered Employees on a substantially
  equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors, including duties,
  responsibilities, geographic location, tenure, and qualifications and (ii)
  will not discriminate between Covered Employees who at the Effective Time are
  covered by Caremark Employee Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by CVS
  Employee Plans, on the other hand, and which CVS will adopt subject to customary
  rights to subsequently amend or terminate such plans as CVS thereafter deems
  appropriate (individually a &#147;<B>New Benefit Plan</B>&#148; and collectively
the &#147;<B>New Benefits Plans</B>&#148;).</FONT></font></P>
<P align="left">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<FONT size=2 face="serif">(b) Each New Benefit Plan will (i) provide all of the Covered Employees eligible to participate in such plans with service credit for purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting and levels of
benefits (but not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan or any retiree medical or other pos-retirement welfare plan or as would otherwise result in a duplication of benefits) for all periods of employment with Caremark or CVS
or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities) prior to the Effective Time, (ii) cause any pre-existing conditions or limitations, eligibility, waiting periods or required physical examinations under any New Benefit Plan
which is a welfare plan to be waived with respect to the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the corresponding plan in which the applicable Covered Employees participated immediately prior to the Effective
Time and, with respect to life insurance coverage, up to the Covered Employee&#146;s current level of insurability, and (iii) give the Covered Employees and their eligible dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or the date
of commencement of participation in such New Benefit Plan) occurs towards applicable deductibles and annual out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred prior to the Executive Time (or the date of commencement of participation in such new Benefit
Plan).</FONT></P>
