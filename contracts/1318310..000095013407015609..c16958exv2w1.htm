 This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 21, 2007 (this " _Agreement_ "), is by and among ev3 Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _ev3_ "), Foreigner Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ev3 (" _Merger Co_."), and FoxHollow Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _FoxHollow_ "). 

  

 A. Each of the respective Boards of Directors of ev3, Merger Co. and FoxHollow has approved, and declared it advisable and in the best interests of its stockholders to consummate, the business combination transaction and other transactions provided for herein, including the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Merger Co. with and into FoxHollow in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. 

  

 B. ev3 and FoxHollow intend the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "). 

  

 C. ev3 and FoxHollow desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 D. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, as an inducement to ev3s willingness to enter into this Agreement and incur the obligations set forth herein, certain of FoxHollows stockholders, which beneficially or of record hold an aggregate of approximately 34.1% of the outstanding shares of FoxHollow Common Stock, have entered into a voting agreement, dated as of the date hereof, with ev3 (each, a " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, upon the terms set forth therein, such stockholders have agreed to vote their shares of FoxHollow Common Stock in favor of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. 

  

 E. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, stockholders of ev3 holding sufficient ev3 Common Stock to approve the ev3 Share Issuance in connection with the Merger and the ev3 Charter Amendment have executed an action by written consent (the " _ev3 Stockholders Written Consent_ ") approving the ev3 Share Issuance and the ev3 Charter Amendment. 

  

 Accordingly, and in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as follows:

For purposes of the calculations in Section 2.1(b), all Non-Electing FoxHollow Shares and 

   ##### 

  

    

shares of FoxHollow Common Stock that constitute Dissenting Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to be Mixed

A "material" FoxHollow Benefit Plan does not include a FoxHollow Benefit Plan sponsored, maintained or contributed to by a non-U.S. Subsidiary of FoxHollow that (A) covers less than 25 employees and (B) would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on FoxHollow 

   

 (ii) No FoxHollow Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(37)).

   ##### 

  

    

no event has occurred and, to the knowledge of FoxHollow, there exists no
condition or set of circumstances in connection with which FoxHollow or any
of its Subsidiaries could be subject to any liability that would reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on FoxHollow under ERISA, the
Code or any other Applicable Law. 

   

 (v) There are no actions, suits or claims pending (other than routine claims for benefits) or, to the knowledge of FoxHollow, threatened against, or with respect to, any of the FoxHollow Benefit Plans. 

   

 (vi) All contributions required to be made to the FoxHollow Benefit Plans pursuant to their terms and Applicable Law have been timely made. 

   

 (vii) The execution and delivery by FoxHollow of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Merger and compliance with the terms hereof (whether alone or in combination with any other event) will not, (A) entitle any current or former employee or director or independent contractor of FoxHollow or any Subsidiary to severance pay, (B) except as expressly required by this Agreement (including Section 5.9), accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any FoxHollow Benefit Plan, (C) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under, any FoxHollow Benefit Plan, or (D) cause any amounts payable under any FoxHollow Benefit Plan (whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) to fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Sections 162(m) or 280G of the Code. 

   

 (viii) None of FoxHollow, any ERISA Affiliate, or FoxHollow Benefit Plan has engaged in a transaction in connection with which FoxHollow, any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate, or any such trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any FoxHollow Benefit Plan or any such trust could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Sections 409 or 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Sections 4975 or 4976 of the Code. 

   

 (ix) Each FoxHollow Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has either applied for, prior to the expiration of the requisite period under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements, or obtained a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements during which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable letter. FoxHollow and its Subsidiaries have not sponsored, maintained or contributed to or had any liability with respect to any qualified pension plan which, during the preceding two (2) years, has been terminated, including by way of merger with or into a FoxHollow Benefit Plan or another plan. 

   

 (x) FoxHollow and its Subsidiaries do not contribute to, have or could have any liability with respect to retiree welfare benefits for present or future terminated employees or their spouses or dependents other than as required by Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") or any comparable state Applicable Law. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (xi) No employer other than FoxHollow, a Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate is permitted to participate in any FoxHollow Benefit Plan and no leased employees (as defined in Code Section 414(n)) or independent contractors are eligible for, or participate in, any FoxHollow Benefit Plan. 

   

 (xii) Each FoxHollow Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined under Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has been operated and administered in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code from the period beginning January 1, 2005 and with respect to any amounts that are "grandfathered" from the application of Section 409A, such plan has not been materially modified since October 3, 2004. There are no agreements in place that would entitle any participant in any such plan to reimbursement for any additional tax imposed by Section 409A of the Code. With respect to FoxHollow Options issued under FoxHollows 1997 Stock Plan prior to January 1, 2005 that vested after December 31, 2004, FoxHollow represents that a good-faith attempt was made to set the exercise price of such options at a price not less than the fair market value of the FoxHollow Common Stock that was subject to the FoxHollow Option at the date of grant of the option. 

   

 (xiii) No FoxHollow Benefit Plan is now, nor in the past seven years been, "top-heavy" pursuant to Code Section 416. 

   

 (xiv) FoxHollow has delivered or made available to ev3 true and complete copies of: 

   

 (A) all material FoxHollow Benefit Plan documents and related trust agreements or other agreements or contracts evidencing any funding vehicle with respect thereto;

 5.9 __Employee Benefit Plans__ _._  

  

 (a) As of and following the Effective Time, ev3 will either (a) continue the employee benefit plans, programs and policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs) of FoxHollow (" _Applicable FoxHollow Plans_ "), except as provided in Section 5.9(b), (b) permit Covered Employees (as defined below) and, as applicable, their eligible dependents, to participate in the employee benefit plans, programs and policies (including without limitation any plan intended to qualify within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code and any vacation, sick, personal time off plans or programs) of ev3 (" _Applicable ev3 Plans_ ") on terms substantially no less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of ev3, or (c) a combination of clauses (a) and (b). Following the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, FoxHollow and ev3, acting in good faith, will cooperate in reviewing and evaluating the Applicable FoxHollow Plans to determine appropriate employee benefit and compensation plans, 

   ##### 

  

    

programs and arrangements for individuals employed with FoxHollow or its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the " _Covered Employees_ ") which, among
other things, will treat Covered Employees on terms substantially no less
favorable then the terms applicable to similarly situated employees of ev3
and which may include offering coverage to Covered Employees and their
dependents under Applicable ev3 Plans. Prior to the Effective Time, FoxHollow
and ev3 will reasonably cooperate to provide any notice to an insurer or
other vendor with respect to the treatment of Applicable FoxHollow Plans or
Applicable ev3 Plans, as determined in accordance with this Section 5.9(a),
provided that such notice may be contingent on the Closing, or may take such
other actions as FoxHollow and ev3 agree is necessary prior to the Effective
Time. ev3 Benefit Plans will provide all Covered Employees eligible to
participate in such plans with service credit for purposes of eligibility,
participation and vesting for all periods of employment with FoxHollow
and its Subsidiaries (or their predecessor entities), but only to the extent
such service would have been taken into account under an Applicable ev3 Plan
had such service been performed as an employee of ev3 and provided that, if
FoxHollow maintained a comparable plan prior to the Effective Time, such
service will only be credited to the extent such service was credited under
such FoxHollow plan. ev3 shall cause pre-existing condition limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
the group health plans of ev3 in which a Covered Employee who is a
participant in a comparable FoxHollow group health plan on the Closing Date
(and their eligible dependents) will participate to be waived, subject to the
approval of any stop-loss or excess-risk insurer with respect to any self-
insured plan, which ev3 will use its best efforts to obtain prior to the
Effective Time. Even if ev3 is unable to obtain approval from the insurer to
waive the pre-existing condition limitation, ev3 agrees that the pre-existing
condition exclusion under its group medical plan will not apply to any
Covered Employee who enrolls in the ev3 plan when first eligible and who has
had coverage under any medical insurance policy (including the
Applicable FoxHollow Plan providing group medical insurance) during the
12-month period prior to the date such Covered Employee enrolls in the ev3
group medical plan (without a break of coverage extending more than 63 days).
If Covered Employees are transitioned from Applicable FoxHollow Plans
providing group health plan coverage to Applicable ev3 Plans providing group
health plan coverage prior to December 31, 2007, ev3 will provide credit
under such Applicable ev3 Plans for any co-payments made and amounts credited
towards deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums by Covered Employees (and
their eligible dependents) under the Applicable FoxHollow Plans between
October 1, 2007 and December 31, 2007; if such transition occurs in 2008, ev3
will provide credit under such Applicable ev3 Plans for any co-payments made
and amounts credited towards deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums
by Covered Employees (and their eligible dependents) under the Applicable
FoxHollow Plans between January 1, 2008 and the date of such transition to
the Applicable ev3 Plans. 

  

 (b) FoxHollow will cease contributions to and terminate each FoxHollow Benefit Plan qualified under Code Section 401(k) (the " _FoxHollow 401(k) Plan_ ") and adopt written resolutions and a plan amendment terminating the FoxHollow 401(k) Plan, the form and substance of which shall be subject to ev3s review and approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), to terminate such FoxHollow 401(k) Plan and to fully (100%) vest all participants under said FoxHollow 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to be effective no later than one business day preceding the Closing Date; provided, however, that such FoxHollow 401(k) Plan termination may be made contingent upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and provided further that 

   ##### 

  

    

FoxHollow makes final matching and 401(k) contributions or any corrective
contributions required by Applicable Law to the FoxHollow 401(k) Plan that is
attributable to contributions that accrued prior to or are based on
compensation earned prior to the Closing Date. Covered Employees who are
participants in the FoxHollow 401(k) Plan will be allowed to rollover their
distributions (including any outstanding plan loan that is not in default)
from the FoxHollow 401(k) Plan into the ev3 401(k) Plan 

  

 (c) With respect to the Converted Options, FoxHollow will not take any action to accelerate the vesting of any such options beyond what is contractually provided as of the date of this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(i) of the FoxHollow Disclosure Schedule), and will take any action that it is permitted to take so that the vesting of such options is not accelerated. 

  

 (d) Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall be treated as an amendment of any Applicable FoxHollow Plan or any Applicable ev3 Plan (or an undertaking to amend any such plan), (ii) nothing in this Section 5.9 will prohibit ev3 from amending, modifying or terminating any Applicable FoxHollow Plan after the Effective Time or Applicable ev3 Plan pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms thereof, and (iii) nothing in this Section 5.9 shall confer any rights or benefits on any person other than FoxHollow and ev3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ev3 shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, the change of control severance agreements between FoxHollow and any officer or employee thereof (individually and collectively referred to herein as the " _Executives_ ") and are set forth in Section 5.9(d) of the FoxHollow Disclosure Schedule. The obligations pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be terminated, amended, or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Executive (and his or her heirs and representatives) without the prior written consent of such affected Executive.

 (b) by either ev3 or FoxHollow, upon written notice to the other party, if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction that must grant a Requisite Regulatory Approval has denied approval of the Merger and such denial has become final and non-appealable; or any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any foreign jurisdiction material to ev3 or FoxHollow shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger, and such order, decree, ruling or other action has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply with Section 5.2 or any other provision of this Agreement has been a proximate cause of, or resulted in, such action; 

  

 (c) by either ev3 or FoxHollow if the Merger shall have not been consummated by January 31, 2008 (the " _Termination Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill any covenant or obligation under this Agreement has been a proximate cause of or resulted in any of the conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in Article VI having failed to be satisfied or fulfilled on or prior to the Termination Date, and such action or failure to fulfill any covenant or obligation constitutes a material breach of this Agreement; 

  

 (d) by either ev3 or FoxHollow if the Required FoxHollow Stockholder Vote shall not have been obtained at the FoxHollow Stockholder Meeting (or any adjournment or postponement thereof) at which a vote was taken on the FoxHollow Stockholder Proposal. 

  

 (e) by either ev3 or FoxHollow, upon written notice to the other party, if there shall have been a breach by the other party of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of such other party, which breach, either individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or (b) or Section 6.3(a) or (b), as the case may be, and which breach has not been cured within thirty (30) days following written notice thereof to the breaching party; provided, however, that such cure period will be 

   ##### 

  

    

extended for such longer period (not to exceed the Termination Date) during
which the breaching party exercises commercially reasonable efforts to cure;
or 

  

 (f) by ev3 in the event that a Triggering Event shall have occurred with respect to FoxHollow. For all purposes of and under this Agreement, a " _Triggering Event_ " shall be deemed to have occurred with respect to FoxHollow if, prior to the Effective Time, any of the following shall have occurred with respect to FoxHollow: (i) FoxHollow shall have failed to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the FoxHollow Stockholder Meeting, or FoxHollow shall have failed to take a vote on the FoxHollow Stockholder Proposal at the FoxHollow Stockholder Meeting, all in accordance with Section 5.5; (ii) the FoxHollow Board or any committee thereof shall have for any reason effected a FoxHollow Board Recommendation Change; (iii) FoxHollow shall have failed to include FoxHollow Board Recommendation in the Information/Proxy Statement-Prospectus; (iv) the FoxHollow Board or any committee thereof shall have for any reason approved, or recommended that the FoxHollow Stockholders approve, any Acquisition Proposal other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether or not a Superior Proposal); (v) except for a confidentiality agreement expressly permitted by Section 5.1, FoxHollow shall have entered into a letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or other agreement accepting any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal); or (vi) an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) shall have been made in respect of FoxHollow by a Person unaffiliated with ev3 and, within ten (10) Business Days after notice of such Acquisition Proposal is first published, sent or given to the FoxHollow Stockholders, and, if requested by ev3, FoxHollow shall not have sent to its stockholders, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act, a statement unconditionally reaffirming the FoxHollow Board Recommendation, and unconditionally recommending that the stockholders of FoxHollow reject such Acquisition Proposal and not tender any shares of its capital stock into such Acquisition Proposal if made in the form of a tender or exchange offer. 

  

 7.2 __Effect of Termination__ _._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either FoxHollow or ev3 as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of ev3 or FoxHollow or their respective officers or directors, except with respect to Section 5.1(b) (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 5.11 (Fees and Expenses), this Section 7.2 (Effect of Termination), Section 7.3 (Termination Fee) and Article VIII (General Provisions), which shall survive such termination and except that no party shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its willful and material breach of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement as provided therein. 

  

 7.3 __Termination Fee__. 

  

 (a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by ev3 pursuant to 7.1(f), FoxHollow shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after the date of such termination, FoxHollow shall pay ev3 a fee equal to Thirty-One Million Dollars ($31 million) in immediately available funds (the " _Termination Fee_ "); 

  

 (b) In the event that (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to FoxHollow or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of FoxHollow generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any Person shall have 

   ##### 

  

    

publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an
Acquisition Proposal, and (ii) this Agreement is terminated by ev3 or
FoxHollow pursuant to Section 7.1(d), then FoxHollow shall pay to ev3 (x)
Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), which the parties agree shall
be reasonable compensation for ev3s expenses in connection with the Merger
(the " _Expense Reimbursement_ ") no later than two (2) Business Days after
the date of such termination and (y) the Termination Fee less the Expense
Reimbursement if within twelve (12) months following such termination
FoxHollow enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates
an Acquisition Transaction, which portion of the Termination Fee shall be
paid to ev3 no later than two (2) Business Days after FoxHollow enters into
such agreement or consummates such acquisition; provided, however that if at
the time this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d) a Triggering
Event has occurred, such termination shall be deemed to be pursuant to Section
7.1(f), and Section 7.3(a) shall apply instead of this Section 7.3(b). For
purposes of this Section 7.3, the term " _Acquisition Transaction_ " shall
mean any transaction described in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" in
Section 5.3(b) except that all references to "15%" shall be deemed references
to "50%". 

  

 (c) In the event that (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to FoxHollow or shall have been made directly to the stockholders of FoxHollow generally or shall have otherwise become publicly known or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) this Agreement is terminated (A) by FoxHollow pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or (B) by ev3 pursuant to Section 7.1(e) and FoxHollows breach is willful and intentional and intended either (I) to solicit, initiate, encourage or facilitate or induce the making of an Acquisition Proposal, or (II) to cause ev3 to terminate this Agreement for a material breach of Section 5.2(a) or Section 5.6, and (iii) within twelve (12) months following such termination, FoxHollow enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates an Acquisition Transaction, then FoxHollow shall pay the Termination Fee to ev3 no later than two (2) Business Days after FoxHollow enters into such agreement or consummates such acquisition. 

  

 (d) In no event shall FoxHollow be required to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 7.3 on more than one occasion (except for the possible payment of the Termination Fee in two parts as provided in Section 7.3(b)). 

  

 (e) FoxHollow hereby acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, without these covenants and agreements, ev3 would not have entered into this Agreement. Accordingly, if FoxHollow shall fail to pay in a timely manner the amounts due pursuant to Sections 7.3(a), 7.3(b) or 7.3(c), and, in order to obtain such payment, ev3 shall make a claim that results in a judgment against FoxHollow, FoxHollow shall pay to ev3 its reasonable costs and expenses (including its reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Sections 7.3(a), 7.3(b) or 7.3(c), as the case may be, at the prime rate of Citibank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

  

 7.4 __Amendment__ _._ This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with this Agreement by the stockholders of FoxHollow or of 

   ##### 

  

    

ev3, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 7.5 __Extension; Waiver__ _._ At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder.

 8.7 __Severability__ _._ Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and, unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

   ##### 

  

    

be effective upon acknowledgment of receipt of such registered mail;
_provided_ that nothing in this Section 8.9 shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by law. The
consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section 8.9 shall not constitute a
general consent to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this Section. The parties
hereto agree that a final judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
