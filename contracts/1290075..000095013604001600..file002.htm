                  CONTRIBUTION AND ISSUANCE; PURCHASE AND SALE

         Section 2.01. Purchase and Sale. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, and subject to the other provisions of this
Section 2.01, the Sellers agree to sell, assign, convey, transfer and deliver to
Buyer, and Buyer agrees to purchase and acquire from the Sellers, the Shares at
the Closing. The purchase price (the "PURCHASE PRICE") for the Shares is
$4,200,000,000 in cash in the aggregate. The Purchase Price is subject to
adjustment in accordance


                                       11
<PAGE>

with Section 2.01(c) and Section 2.03(a) and is subject to further adjustment
after the Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.04.

         (b) The portion of the aggregate Purchase Price to be allocated to the
Shares and, if applicable, any other shares acquired separately pursuant to
Section 2.01(d), will be determined in accordance with Section 2.05. Any such
separate purchases and sales will not change the aggregate Purchase Price
specified in Section 2.01(a) (as it may be adjusted as described above).

         (c) (i) Upon delivery to Buyer of the Adjusted EBITDA Schedule and the
supporting letter of Ernst & Young pursuant to Section 5.04(c)(iii), the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted (if applicable) prior to Closing as set forth
in this clause (i). If the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Ondeo Nalco Group
for the LTM, as shown on such schedule, is in excess of $550,000,000, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of 8.0 times
such excess. If the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of the Ondeo Nalco Group for the
LTM, as shown on such schedule, is less than $520,000,000, the Purchase Price
shall be decreased by an amount equal to the product of 8.0 times such shortfall
(subject to Section 12.01).

                  (i) If the Sellers fail to deliver to Buyer the Reviewed June
         Financial Statements and the June Comfort Letter by October 15, 2003
         pursuant to Section 5.04(d), the Purchase Price shall be decreased by
         an amount equal to $42,000,000.

                  (ii) If the Closing has not occurred by November 10, 2003 and
         the Sellers fail to deliver to Buyer the Reviewed September Financial
         Statements and the September Comfort Letter by such date pursuant to
         Section 5.04(f), the Purchase Price shall be decreased by an amount
         equal to $42,000,000.

         (d) The Sellers shall consider in good faith any requests by Buyer to
acquire at the Closing, directly or indirectly and in separate transactions that
would be deemed to occur immediately prior to the purchase and sale of the
Shares, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of any of the
Subsidiaries of NIS or ONC (other than the NIS Subsidiaries), it being agreed
and understood that Seller shall not be under any obligation to agree to any
such request or take any action included in such request.

         Section 2.02. Closing. The closing (the "CLOSING") of the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.01 shall take place at the offices of Simpson Thacher
& Bartlett LLP, New York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later
than five business days, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Article 10, or at such other time or place as Buyer and the Sellers may agree.
At the Closing:

         (a) Buyer shall deliver to the Sellers and, if applicable, the sellers
of the Subsidiaries to be purchased separately in accordance with Section

accounts designated by the applicable Seller or Subsidiary (in accordance with
the allocation determined pursuant to Section 2.01(a) and Section 2.05(a)), by
notice to Buyer, which notice shall be delivered not later than two business
days prior to the Closing Date.

         (b) The Sellers shall, and shall cause the owners of the shares of any
other Subsidiaries to be purchased separately in accordance with Section 2.01(d)
to, deliver to Buyer certificates or assignment deeds for the Shares and any
such other shares duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed in
blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed thereto.

         Section 2.03. Closing Working Capital; Closing Indebtedness. (a) No
later than 15 days prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers will cause to be
prepared and delivered to Buyer a certificate setting forth the Sellers' good
faith estimates of (i) Closing Working Capital ("ESTIMATED WORKING CAPITAL") and
(ii) Closing Indebtedness ("ESTIMATED CLOSING INDEBTEDNESS"), and the basis for
the calculation thereof. If (i) Estimated Working Capital minus Estimated
Closing Indebtedness is greater than (ii) Base Working Capital, the Purchase
Price to be paid by Buyer at the Closing shall be increased by the amount of
such excess. If (i) Estimated Working Capital minus Estimated Closing
Indebtedness is less than (ii) Base Working Capital, the Purchase Price to be
paid by Buyer at the Closing shall be decreased by the amount of such deficit.
"BASE WORKING CAPITAL" means $575,000,000. It is understood and agreed that
while such certificate shall set forth such good faith estimates and the basis
for the calculation thereof, for purposes of this Section 2.03 and Section 2.04,
Estimated Working Capital shall be deemed not to exceed $500,000,000.

         (b) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days, after the
Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Sellers a

calculations of Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (excluding any effects, changes or adjustments
arising from the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date, other
than those contemplated by Section 7.04). The Closing Adjustment Certificate
shall (x) be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with
those used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet, (y) shall include all of the
line items described in the definition of "Closing Working Capital" in Section
2.03(c) and all of the components set forth in the definition of "Indebtedness"
in Section 1.01(a), and (z) to the extent consistent with GAAP, be prepared

                  relating to insurance that the Companies and the Subsidiaries
                  will not have the benefit of after the Closing) to the extent
                  the Companies and the Subsidiaries remain entitled after the
                  Closing to the benefits of the services or items in respect of
                  which the prepayment has been made, minus

                  of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except to
                  the extent such payments are waived prior to the Closing), and

                           (G) current and non-current restructuring,

(iii) for the avoidance of doubt, any items reflected in the calculation of
Closing Working Capital).

         (e) If the Sellers disagree with Buyer's calculations of Closing
Working Capital and/or Closing Indebtedness delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(b), the Sellers may, within 30 days after delivery of the Closing
Adjustment Certificate, deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such
calculations and setting forth the Sellers' calculations of such amounts. Any
such notice of disagreement shall be in writing and shall specify in reasonable
detail those particular items and amounts contained in the Closing Adjustment
Certificate as to which the Sellers disagree, and the Sellers shall be deemed to
have agreed with


                                       15
<PAGE>

all other amounts contained in the Closing Adjustment Certificate. Such
disagreement shall specify the amount of Closing Working Capital and Closing
Indebtedness as calculated by Sellers, on the basis of the foregoing.

         (f) If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered in accordance with
Section 2.03(e), the Sellers and Buyer shall, during the 15 days following such
delivery, use their best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or
amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Working
Capital and Closing Indebtedness, which amount (i) of Closing Working Capital
shall not be more than the amount thereof shown in the Sellers' calculations
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(e) nor less than the amount thereof shown in

Indebtedness shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in the Seller's
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(e) nor more than the amount

during such period, the Sellers and Buyer are unable to reach such agreement,
they shall promptly thereafter cause an Accounting Referee (as defined below)
promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts for the
purpose of calculating Closing Working Capital and Closing Indebtedness. In
making such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items
or amounts in the Closing Adjustment Certificate as to which the Sellers have
disagreed in accordance with Section 2.03(e). The Accounting Referee shall
deliver to the Sellers and Buyer a report setting forth such calculation. The
Sellers and Buyer shall use their best efforts to cause the Accounting Referee
to deliver such report within 30 days following appointment of the Accounting
Referee. Such report shall be final and binding upon the Sellers and Buyer. The
cost of such review and report shall be borne by Buyer if (i) the difference
between (A) Final Working Capital minus Final Indebtedness and (B) Buyer's
calculation of Closing Working Capital minus Buyer's calculation of Closing
Indebtedness delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b) is greater than (ii) the
difference between (A) Final Working Capital minus Final Indebtedness and (B)
the Sellers' calculation of Closing Working Capital minus the Sellers'
calculation of Closing Indebtedness delivered pursuant to 2.03(e), by the
Sellers if the first such difference is less than the second such difference and
otherwise equally by Buyer and the Sellers. For purposes of this Section
2.03(f), "ACCOUNTING REFEREE" means KPMG LLP or, if such firm shall decline or
is unable to act, another internationally recognized independent accounting firm

cooperate and assist in the calculation of Closing Working Capital and Closing
Indebtedness and in the conduct of the review by the Accounting Referee referred

extent necessary of books, records, work papers and personnel.

         Section 2.04. Adjustment of Purchase Price. (a) If Estimated Working
Capital exceeds Final Working Capital by an amount greater than $3,000,000 (the
amount by which it is greater than $3,000,000 being the "WORKING CAPITAL
ADJUSTMENT SHORTFALL"), the Sellers shall pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.04(c),
the amount of such Working Capital Adjustment Shortfall. If (i) Final Working
Capital exceeds (ii) Estimated Working Capital by an amount greater than
$3,000,000 (the amount by which it is greater than $3,000,000 being the "WORKING
CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT EXCESS"), Buyer shall pay to the Sellers, in the manner and
with interest as provided in Section 2.04(c), the amount of such Working Capital
Adjustment Excess. "FINAL WORKING CAPITAL" means Closing Working Capital as
shown in Buyer's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b), if no notice
of disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
2.03(e); or if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, as agreed by the
Sellers and Buyer pursuant to Section 2.03(f) or in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee's calculation delivered pursuant
to Section 2.03(f); provided that, in no event shall Final Working Capital be
more than the Sellers' calculation of Closing Working Capital delivered pursuant
to Section 2.03(e) or less than Buyer's calculation of Closing Working Capital
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b).

         (b) If Estimated Closing Indebtedness exceeds Final Indebtedness, Buyer
shall pay to the Sellers, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner
and with interest as provided in Section 2.04(c), the amount of such excess. If
Final Indebtedness exceeds Estimated Closing Indebtedness, the Sellers shall pay
to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, in the manner and with
interest as provided in Section 2.04(c), the amount of such excess. "FINAL
INDEBTEDNESS" means Closing Indebtedness as shown in Buyer's calculation
delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b), if no notice of disagreement with respect
thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(e); or if such a notice of
disagreement is delivered, as agreed by the Sellers and Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.03(f) or in the absence of such agreement, as shown in the Accounting
Referee's calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(f); provided that, in
no event shall Final Indebtedness be less than the Sellers' calculation of
Closing Indebtedness delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(e) or more than Buyer's
calculation of Closing Indebtedness delivered pursuant to Section 2.03(b).

         (c) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.04(a) or Section 2.04(b) shall be
made at a mutually convenient time and place within five days after the Final
Working Capital and Final Indebtedness have been determined by delivery by Buyer
or the Sellers, as the case may be, of a certified or official bank check


                                       17

payable in immediately available funds to the other party or by causing such
payments to be credited to such account of such other party as may be designated
by such other party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant to this
Section shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date to but excluding
the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment. Such interest shall be
payable at the same time as the payment to which it relates and shall be
calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days and the actual number of
days elapsed.

         Section 2.05. Allocation of the Purchase Price. (a) No later than 30
days after the date hereof, Buyer shall provide to Sellers a statement
allocating the Purchase Price among the ONC Common Shares, the ONC Preferred
Shares, the shares of each NIS Subsidiary and the shares of any other Subsidiary
to be acquired as mutually agreed between Sellers and Buyer pursuant to Section
2.01(d) hereof (the "PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION" and the portion of the Purchase
Price allocable to the ONC Common Shares and the ONC Preferred Shares, the "ONC
PURCHASE PRICE"); provided that the allocation of the Purchase Price to the NIS
Subsidiaries shall be no less than $100,000,000 nor greater than $500,000,000
and provided further that the allocation of the Purchase Price to the ONC
Preferred Shares shall be an amount equal to such Shares' liquidation
preference. If the Sellers disagree with Buyer's calculation of the Purchase
Price Allocation, the Sellers may, within 15 days after delivery of Buyer's
calculation of the Purchase Price Allocation, deliver a notice to Buyer
disagreeing with such calculation and setting forth Sellers' proposed Purchase
Price Allocation. Sellers and Buyer shall, during the 15 day period following
delivery of Sellers' notice of disagreement, use their reasonable best efforts
to resolve such dispute. If during such period, Sellers and Buyer are unable to
resolve such dispute, they shall promptly retain the Accounting Referee to
resolve such dispute. The Sellers and Buyer shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to resolve such dispute within 15 days
of the retention of the Accounting Referee. The Accounting Referee's
determination of the Purchase Price Allocation shall be final and binding on the
Sellers and Buyer. The costs of retaining the Accounting Referee for purposes of
determining the Purchase Price Allocation shall be borne equally by Sellers, on
the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand. The Sellers and Buyer and their
respective Affiliates agree to (i) be bound, and cause their Affiliates to be
bound, by the Purchase Price Allocation and (ii) act, and to cause their
Affiliates to act, in accordance with such allocation in the preparation, filing
and audit of any Return (including, without limitation, the filing of any forms,
information returns, reports or statements with any Return for the taxable year
that includes the Closing Date) and for all Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by a Final Determination.

         (b) If an adjustment is made to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
2.01(c), Section 2.03(a), Section 2.04 or Section 8.10 hereof or required
pursuant to Section 2.01(d) hereof, Buyer shall provide to Sellers an adjustment
to the Purchase Price Allocation within 10 days of the determination of Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Estimated Working Capital and Estimated Closing
Indebtedness or Final Working Capital and Final Indebtedness (in the case of an
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.01(c), Section 2.03(a) or Section 2.04 hereof)
or the date of a payment due under Article 8 or 11 (in the case of an adjustment
pursuant to Section 8.10 hereof). If Sellers disagree with such adjustment,
Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of such disagreement. In the event that an
agreement regarding the appropriate allocation is not reached within 20 days
after the determination of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Estimated Working Capital
and Estimated Closing Indebtedness or Final Working Capital and Final
Indebtedness (in the case of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to
Section 2.04 hereof) or the date of a payment due under Articles 8 or 11 hereof
(in the case of an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 8.10
hereof), Buyer and the Sellers shall jointly retain the Accounting Referee to
resolve the disputed items. Upon resolution of the disputed items, the Purchase
Price Allocation shall be adjusted to reflect such resolution. The Sellers and
Buyer shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Accounting Referee to
deliver its resolution of the disputed items within 30 days following
appointment thereof. The costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Referee
retained pursuant to this Section 2.05(b) shall be borne equally by Buyer, on
the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand. Buyer and the Sellers agree to
file any additional information return required to be filed pursuant to the Code
and any state, local or foreign Tax law to reflect such adjustment to the
allocation of the Purchase Price.

         Section 2.06. Post-Closing Payment in Respect of Ondeo India. (a) If,
pursuant to one or more offers required to be made under Indian law or
regulation or other local listing obligations which in any case are applicable
by virtue of either the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
earlier indirect acquisition of Ondeo India by Suez, additional shares of Ondeo
India are acquired by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates after the date
hereof or by Buyer, the Companies or any of the Subsidiaries after the Closing,
the Purchase Price will be adjusted as follows:

                  (i) If such acquisition is made by any of the Sellers or their
         Affiliates, then as promptly as practicable after the latest of their
         acquisition of such shares, the Closing Date and the receipt of all
         Indian Approvals, all such shares will be purchased by Buyer or an
         entity designated by Buyer for a purchase price equal to the number of
         shares of Ondeo India so purchased multiplied by the Ondeo India Per
         Share Attributed Value. The Sellers will be deemed to give to the
         applicable purchaser the representation in Section 3.06 as to the
         shares purchased.

         acquisition, the Sellers will transfer, or will cause the transfer to a
         Subsidiary designated in writing by Buyer, immediately available funds
         equal to the number of shares of Ondeo India so acquired times the

         the maximum amount required to be offered by Suez under the SEBI Order
         as of or prior to the date of such acquisition) over (B) the Ondeo
         India Per Share Attributed Value.

         (b) Each party hereto or such party's Affiliates shall obtain any
requisite regulatory approvals from the Indian Foreign Investment Promotion
Board, the Reserve Bank of India or any other Indian governmental authority (the
"INDIAN APPROVALS") with respect to the acquisition of any shares of Ondeo India
by such party or such party's Affiliates pursuant to this Section 2.06.

December 31, 2002, the fair market value of the assets of each Employee Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than a "multiemployer plan," as defined

contributions) exceeded the present value of the pension benefit obligations
accrued under such Title IV Plan calculated pursuant to FAS No. 87. No

predecessor thereof contributes to, or has in the past five years contributed
to, any multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA nor do any of
the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate of the Companies have any liabilities under
such a plan that remain unsatisfied.

         (d) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has pending
or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such determination
from the Internal Revenue Service, and neither Company is aware of any reason
why any such determination letter should be revoked or not be reissued. The
Companies have made available to Buyer copies of the most recent Internal
Revenue Service determination letters with respect to each such Employee Plan.
Each Employee Plan has been established and maintained in material compliance
with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutes,
orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code,
which are applicable to such Employee Plan. No events have occurred with respect
to any Employee Plan that could result in payment or assessment by or against
the Companies of any material excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976,
4977, 4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.20(d), all contributions made to the

been deductible by the Companies under the Code.

for retired, former or current employees of any Company or Subsidiary, except as
required to avoid excise tax under Section 4980B of the Code.

or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are
pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers, threatened, (ii) no written
communication has been received from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
(the "PBGC") in respect of any Employee Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA
concerning the funded status of any such plan or any transfer of assets and
liabilities from any such plan in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein, and (iii) no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative
proceeding by the Department of Labor, the PBGC, the Internal Revenue Service or
other governmental agencies are pending or, to the knowledge of the Sellers,
threatened (including, without limitation, any routine requests for information
from the PBGC).

         (g) Except as set forth and quantified in Schedule 3.20(g), no Employee
Plan exists that, solely as a result of the execution of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, would result in the increase,
acceleration or provision of any payments, benefits or other rights to any
employee of any Company or Subsidiary which amounts could become a liability of
such Company or Subsidiary or Buyer. There is no contract, plan or arrangement
covering any employee or former employee of any Company or Subsidiary that,
individually or collectively, could give rise to payment of any amount that
would not be deductible under Section 280G or 4999 of the Code.

         (h) All Foreign Benefit Plans have been established and maintained in
material compliance with their terms and all applicable statutes, laws, orders,
rules and regulations of any controlling governmental authority or
instrumentality. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.20(h), all Foreign Benefit
Plans that are required to be funded are fully funded and, with respect to the
Foreign Benefit Plans, adequate reserves therefor have been established on the
accounting statements of the applicable Company or Subsidiary entity in the
ordinary course consistent with past practice and in accordance with applicable
accounting practices and procedures.

the Sellers from sources other than Buyer or any Company or Subsidiary.

         (b) Notwithstanding Section 6.01(a), the Sellers may disclose the tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any materials, opinions or analyses relating to such tax treatment or
tax structure, but without disclosure of identifying information or, except to
the extent relating to such tax structure or tax treatment, any nonpublic
commercial or financial information). Moreover, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, there shall be no limitation on the Sellers'
ability to consult any tax adviser, whether or not independent from the Sellers
or their Affiliates, regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 6.02. Solvency of the Companies. Buyer shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Sellers copies of any solvency opinions or similar materials
obtained from third parties in connection with the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent contractually permitted by the
issuer of such opinion. Buyer shall use reasonable efforts to cause the firms
issuing any such solvency opinions to allow the Sellers to rely thereon;
provided that no material fee or expense is associated with obtaining such
reliance.

    Section 6.03. Notices of Certain Events. The Buyer shall promptly notify the
Sellers of the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that would or would
reasonably be expected to result in the failure of any condition contained in
Article 10 to be satisfied or that would cause any of their representations or
warranties contained herein to not be true and correct if made as of the Closing
Date.

                                   ARTICLE 7
                       COVENANTS OF BUYER AND THE SELLERS

         Buyer and the Sellers agree that:

         Section 7.01. Efforts; Further Assurances. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and each Seller will use its reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable laws and regulations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Sellers and
Buyer agree, and the Sellers, prior to the Closing, and Buyer, after the
Closing, agree to cause each Company and Subsidiary, to execute and deliver such
other documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such
other actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or
implement expeditiously the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, Buyer will use its reasonable efforts to obtain the
financing contemplated by Section 10.02(b), or alternative financing on
substantially comparable or more


                                       51
<PAGE>

favorable terms, as promptly as practical, and such reasonable efforts shall
include acceptance of any changes requested by the applicable financing sources
in the terms and conditions of such financing pursuant to any "market flex"
provisions specifically set forth in any agreement or understanding entered into
by Buyer, or to which Buyer is a party, in connection with the Commitment
Letters. The Sellers acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall have the right to
seek to obtain a portion of such financing through a placement of notes pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933; provided, however, that Buyer
will use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Buyer will be entitled, if such
placement is not completed by December 31, 2003, to promptly consummate the
financing in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letters, subject to satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions
set forth therein and in Article 10 of this Agreement (it being understood and
agreed that such reasonable efforts shall include working in good faith with the
financing sources so as to complete all definitive documentation relating to
such financing prior to such date). Buyer shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Sellers, amend, modify or supplement (i) any of the conditions or
contingencies to funding contained in the Commitment Letters or (ii) any other
provision of the Commitment Letters to the extent such amendment, modification
or supplement would have the effect of amending, modifying or supplementing any
condition or contingency to funding or would otherwise be in a manner adverse to
the interests of the Sellers.

         Section 7.02. Certain Filings. (a) The Sellers and Buyer shall
cooperate with one another (i) in determining whether any action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is required (including,
without limitation, under applicable Antitrust Laws), or any actions, consents,
approvals, clearances or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any
material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information to the other party or to any Governmental
Authority reasonably required in connection therewith (including making the
filings in the jurisdictions listed in Schedule 4.03 on a timely basis) and
using their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any such actions,
consents, approvals, clearances or waivers (including, without limitation,
seeking early termination of applicable waiting periods).

         (b) Buyer and each Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cooperate in all respects with each other, and to keep the other party informed
in all material respects with respect to any communication given or received, in
connection with any filing, submission, investigation or proceeding relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 7.07, the parties to
this Agreement shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in
exchanging such information and providing such assistance as each other party
may


                                       52
<PAGE>

reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including the HSR Act, the EC
Merger Regulations and any other applicable international laws, statutes or
regulations.

         (c) Buyer and the Sellers agree to take all actions reasonably
necessary to make the filings required of Buyer and the Sellers under applicable
Antitrust Laws or any other filing required by any Governmental Authority
pursuant to applicable law or regulation with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and in any event (x) with respect
to filings pursuant to the HSR Act, the Canadian Competition Act and the
Antitrust Laws of Brazil, within 15 business days of the date hereof and (y)
with respect to filings under the EC Merger Regulation and the Antitrust Laws of
Mexico, within 20 business days of the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within 5 business days of the receipt of any
request therefor, any additional information and documentary or other material
that may be requested pursuant to any such Antitrust Law or Governmental
Authority. Buyer and the Sellers further agree not to withdraw their respective
Notification and Report Form or to otherwise extend the time for review of the
transaction without the other party's prior written consent.

         (d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or if any suit or proceeding is
instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Antitrust Law, Buyer and the Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts
promptly to resolve such objections. In furtherance of the foregoing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all reasonable action, including
agreeing to hold separate or to divest any of the businesses or properties or
assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, following the Closing, any
of the Companies and/or Subsidiaries), as may be required (i) by the applicable
Governmental Authority in order to resolve such objections as such Governmental
Authority may have to such transactions under any Antitrust Law, or (ii) by any
domestic or foreign court or other tribunal, in any action or proceeding brought
by a private party or Governmental Authority challenging such transactions as
violative of any Antitrust Law, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution, vacating, lifting, altering or reversal of, any order that has the
effect of restricting, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that Buyer shall not be
required to take any such action to the extent such action would have a material
adverse effect on the business or assets of Buyer and its Affiliates, taken as a
whole.

         Section 7.03. Public Announcements; Confidentiality. (a) The parties
agree to reasonably consult with each other before issuing any press release or


                                       53
<PAGE>

making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except for any press releases and public announcements
the making of which may be required by applicable law or any listing agreement
with any national or foreign securities exchange, will not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation.

         (b) Subject to any disclosure required by applicable law or regulation
(whether in connection with the filings to be made pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise) or any listing agreement with any national or foreign securities
exchange, the parties hereto agree to keep this Agreement (including the
schedules and exhibits hereto) confidential.

         Section 7.04. Intercompany Accounts. Except as set forth on Schedule
7.04, all intercompany accounts between any Seller or its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and any Company or Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be paid in full in
cash on or prior to the Closing. Except as set forth in Schedule 7.04, any
agreements between any Seller or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
Company or Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be terminated at or prior to the
Closing.

         Section 7.05. Transitional Use of Trademarks and Tradenames;
Cooperation. (a) Following the Closing, the Companies and the Subsidiaries shall
have the right to use the trademarks and tradenames set forth on Schedule 7.05
(the "SELLER TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES") or any words or logos used by the
Companies and the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing that are confusingly similar
thereto, for the time period set forth with respect thereto on Schedule 7.05
(the "TRANSITIONAL PERIOD"), as, or as part of, a corporate name, tradename,
trademark, service mark, domain name or other source indicator, without
obligation to pay royalties to the Sellers or their Affiliates, so long as such
use is in a substantially similar manner and to a similar extent as such Seller
Trademarks and Tradenames were used by the Companies and the Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller Trademarks and Tradenames
do not include the names "Nalco" or "Calgon" or any trademarks, registrations or
applications thereto (the "NALCO/CALGON TRADEMARKS"), and nothing contained in
this Section 7.05 or any other provision of this Agreement shall restrict in any
manner Buyer or any of its Affiliates' (including the Companies and the
Subsidiaries) use of, and right to, the Nalco/Calgon Trademarks after the
Closing.

         (b) From and after the expiration of the Transitional Period, the
Companies and the Subsidiaries shall (i) cease all use of the Seller Trademarks
and Tradenames and (ii) destroy, return or remove the Seller Trademarks and
Tradenames from all stationery, signs, billboards, vehicles and other places and
media in which they appear; provided that Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Companies and the Subsidiaries) shall not be required to destroy equipment,


                                       54
<PAGE>

technology or inventory bearing the Seller Trademarks and Tradenames if to do so
would be unreasonably expensive.

         (c) Nothing contained in this Section 7.05 or any other provision of
this Agreement shall restrict the Sellers from using or licensing others to use
the Seller Trademarks and Tradenames; provided that from and after the Closing
Date, Sellers shall not (i) use the name "Ondeo Nalco" or any other words, names
or logos substantially similar thereto (the "ONDEO NALCO TRADEMARKS") except
during the Transitional Period, (ii) license others the right to use the Ondeo
Nalco Trademarks, or (iii) use for any purpose, or have any right to, the
Nalco/Calgon Trademarks.

         (d) During the Transitional Period, the Sellers, Buyer and the
Companies and Subsidiaries shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) cooperate
reasonably in establishing hypertext links, legends or other notices informing
and directing third parties who visit each other's respective Internet web sites
of the location of the respective Internet web sites of the other parties. The
Sellers, Buyers and the Companies and the Subsidiaries shall, at their own
expense, cooperate in good faith to resolve technical and other issues with
respect to the above and otherwise to direct consumer traffic properly and
efficiently among their respective web sites during the Transitional Period.

         (e) During the Transitional Period, and at the expense of the Companies
and the Subsidiaries, the Sellers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to)
cooperate reasonably to the extent necessary to transfer, protect, secure and
vest good and valid title to the Companies and their Subsidiaries in the Company
Intellectual Property Rights.

         Section 7.06. Ondeo India. The Sellers and Buyer agree, and the Sellers
agree to cause Suez and its Affiliates, at the request of Buyer, to cooperate in
requesting that the SEBI permit the consolidation of all offers for the shares
of Ondeo India required under Indian law or regulation or other local listing
obligation to be made by the Sellers or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and
Buyer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, whether such requirement arises in
connection with a prior failure to comply with Indian law or regulation or with
this Agreement.

         Section 7.07. Confidentiality. (a) Prior to the Closing Date and after
any termination of this Agreement, Buyer acknowledges that the confidential
information being provided to it by Sellers and the Companies remains subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement dated April 9, 2003 between Blackstone
Management Associates IV L.L.C. and UBS Warburg LLC (the "CONFIDENTIALITY
Agreement"). At Closing, the Sellers agree to cause themselves and their
Affiliates to assign to Buyer all of their rights pursuant to any
confidentiality


                                       55
<PAGE>

agreement entered into in connection with the process of selling the Companies
and the Subsidiaries (to the extent permitted by such confidentiality
agreements). Following the Closing Date, the Sellers and their Affiliates, will
hold, and will use their best efforts to cause their respective officers,
directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to
hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of law, all confidential documents and
information concerning the Companies and the Subsidiaries, except to the extent
that such information can be shown to have been in the public domain through no
fault of the Sellers and their Affiliates; provided that Seller may disclose
such information to its officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, advisors and agents in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or its rights and obligations hereunder), so
long as such Persons are informed by Seller of the confidential nature of such
information and are directed by Seller to treat such information confidentially.
Seller shall be responsible for any failure to treat such information
confidentially by such Persons. The obligation of the Sellers hereunder to hold
any such information in confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same
care with respect to such information as they would take to preserve the
confidentiality of their own similar information.

         (b) Notwithstanding Section 7.07(a), the parties may disclose the tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including any materials, opinions or analyses relating to such tax treatment or
tax structure, but without disclosure of identifying information or, except to
the extent relating to such tax structure or tax treatment, any nonpublic
commercial or financial information). Moreover, notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, there shall be no limitation on the parties'
ability to consult any tax adviser, whether or not independent from the parties,
regarding the tax treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

all Returns with respect to the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries for

         (d) On June 30 and December 31 of each year, beginning on June 30, 2004
(each such date a "TRUE-UP DATE", and each period ending on a True-Up Date, a
"TRUE-UP PERIOD"), Buyer shall provide to Sellers a schedule (each, a "LIABILITY
TRUE-UP SCHEDULE") setting forth, with respect to the Non-Consolidated Income
Tax Returns filed by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.02(b) and Section 8.02(c)
during the True-Up Period ending on such True-Up Date:

                  (i) the sum of (A) in the case of Returns for Pre-Closing Tax
         Periods, the aggregate amount of the liabilities for Taxes, if any,
         shown on such Returns, and (B) in the case of Returns for Straddle
         Periods, the aggregate amount of Tax liabilities, if any, that relate
         to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, as
         determined pursuant to Section 8.04 (such sum, the "AGGREGATE TAX
         LIABILITY AMOUNT"), and

                  (ii) the aggregate Tax liability, if any, with respect to such
         Returns taken into account in the calculation of Final Working Capital
         (the "AGGREGATE LIABILITY ACCRUAL AMOUNT").

For avoidance of doubt, the calculations of the Aggregate Tax Liability Amount
and the Aggregate Liability Accrual Amount shall in each case include the effect
of any amounts paid by Sellers or the relevant Company or Subsidiary, or any of


                                       59
<PAGE>

their respective Affiliates, prior to the Closing in respect of the relevant
Taxes (including, but not limited to, payments of estimated Taxes) to the extent
reflected on a Return or taken into account in the calculation of Final Working
Capital. Each Liability True-Up Schedule delivered by Buyer shall be accompanied
by such supporting detail as is reasonably required to permit Sellers to
determine the accuracy and completeness of the amounts shown on such Schedule.

         If Sellers disagree with the amounts and calculations set forth on the
Liability True-Up Schedule, Sellers may, within 15 days after delivery of the
Liability True-Up Schedule, deliver a written notice (a "SECTION 8.03(D)
NOTICE") to Buyer disagreeing with such amounts and calculations and specifying
in reasonable detail those amounts and calculations with which Sellers disagree
and the basis for such disagreement. Sellers and Buyer shall, during the 15-day
period following delivery of such Section 8.03(d) Notice, use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve such disagreement. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to
resolve such disagreement, they shall promptly retain the Accounting Referee to
resolve such dispute, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Accounting Referee to resolve such dispute within 15 days following such
retention. The Accounting Referee's determinations with respect to the disputed
items on the Liability True-Up Schedule shall be final and binding on the
Sellers and Buyer. Within 5 days after (i) if Sellers do not deliver a Section
8.03(d) Notice, the expiration of the 15-day period following delivery of the
Liability True-Up Schedule, or (ii) if Sellers do deliver a Section 8.03(d)
Notice, the date on which the Sellers and Buyer agree on such Liability True-Up
Schedule or the date on which the Accounting Referee's delivers its written
determinations with respect to the disputed items on the True-Up Schedule:

                  (A) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the excess, if any, of the
         Aggregate Tax Liability Amount over the Aggregate Liability Accrual
         Amount, or

                  (B) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the excess, if any, of the
         Aggregate Liability Accrual Amount over the Aggregate Tax Liability
         Amount,

in each case as set forth on the Liability True-Up Schedule as delivered by
Buyer and adjusted to reflect the mutual agreement of Sellers and Buyer or the
determinations, if any, made by the Accounting Referee with respect thereto.

         (e) On each True-Up Date, Buyer shall provide to Sellers a schedule
(each, a "REFUND TRUE-UP SCHEDULE") setting forth, with respect to the
Non-Consolidated Income Tax Returns filed by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.02(b)
and Section 8.02(c) during the True-Up Period ending on such True-Up Date:


                                       60
<PAGE>

                  (i) the sum of (A) in the case of Returns for Pre-Closing Tax
         Periods, the aggregate amount of the refunds of Taxes, if any, shown on
         such Returns, and (B) in the case of Returns for Straddle Periods, the
         aggregate amount of refunds for, or overpayments of, Taxes, if any,
         that relate to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing
         Date, as determined pursuant to Section 8.04 (such sum, the "AGGREGATE
         REFUND AMOUNT"), and

                  (ii) the aggregate refunds for, or overpayments of, Taxes, if
         any, with respect to such Returns taken into account in the calculation
         of Final Working Capital (the "AGGREGATE REFUND ACCRUAL AMOUNT").

For the avoidance of doubt, the calculations of the Aggregate Refund Amount and
the Aggregate Refund Accrual Amount shall in each case include the effect of any
amounts paid by Sellers or the relevant Company or Subsidiary, or any of their
respective Affiliates, prior to the Closing in respect of the relevant Taxes
(including, but not limited to, payments of estimated Taxes) to the extent
reflected on a Return or taken into account in the calculation of Final Working
Capital. Each Refund True-Up Schedule delivered by Buyer shall be accompanied by
such supporting detail as is reasonably required to permit Sellers to determine
the accuracy and completeness of the amounts shown on such Schedule.

         If Sellers disagree with the amounts and calculations set forth on the
Refund True-Up Schedule, Sellers may, within 15 days after delivery of the
Refund True-Up Schedule, deliver a written notice (a "SECTION 8.03(E) NOTICE")
to Buyer disagreeing with such amounts and calculations and specifying in
reasonable detail those amounts and calculations with which Sellers disagree and
the basis for such disagreement. Sellers and Buyer shall, during the 15-day
period following delivery of such Section 8.03(e) Notice, use their reasonable
best efforts to resolve such disagreement. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to
resolve such disagreement, they shall promptly retain the Accounting Referee to
resolve such dispute within 15 days following such retention. The Accounting
Referee's determinations with respect to the disputed items on the Refund
True-Up Schedule shall be final and binding on the Sellers and Buyer. Within 5
days after (i) if Sellers do not deliver a Section 8.03(e) Notice, the
expiration of the 15-day period following delivery of the Refund True-Up
Schedule, or (ii) if Sellers do deliver a Section 8.03(e) Notice, the date the
Sellers and Buyer agree on such Refund True-Up Schedule or the date on which the
Accounting Referee delivers its written determination with respect to the
disputed items on the Refund True-Up Schedule:

         (A) Buyer shall pay to Sellers the excess, if any, of the Aggregate
         Refund Amount over the Aggregate Refund Accrual Amount, or


                                       61
<PAGE>

         (B) Sellers shall pay to Buyer the excess, if any, of the Aggregate
         Refund Accrual Amount over the Aggregate Refund Amount,

in each case as set forth on the Refund True-up Schedule as delivered by Buyer
and adjusted to reflect the mutual agreement of Sellers and Buyer or the
determination, if any, made by the Accounting Referee with respect thereto.

         Section 8.04. Allocation of Tax Liability. (a) For purposes of this
Article, unless otherwise required by a Final Determination, the parties hereto
agree to allocate Tax items between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Post-Closing Tax
Periods that end and begin, respectively, on the Closing Date on the basis of a
"closing of the books" on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the
parties hereto agree that neither party will make a ratable allocation election
under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any similar provision
of state, local or foreign law.

         (b) For purposes of this Article, in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed with respect to a Straddle Period on a periodic basis, the portion of
such Tax related to the portion of such Tax period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than gross receipts, sales
or use Taxes and Taxes based upon or related to income, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in
the entire Tax period, and (y) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income and any gross receipts, sales or use Tax, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the
Closing Date and was therefore subject to Section 8.04(a). All determinations
necessary to give effect to the allocation set forth in the foregoing clause (y)
shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Companies and
the Subsidiaries.

         (c) For purposes of Section 8.04(a) and (b), in accordance with
Treasury Regulation 1.1502-76 and any analogous provision of state, local or
foreign law, any Tax related to an extraordinary transaction, other than any
transaction expressly contemplated by this Agreement, that occurs on the Closing
Date after the Closing shall be allocated to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

         Section 8.05. Tax Covenants. (a) Buyer covenants that, except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or required by applicable law, it
will not cause or permit any Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate (i) to take any
action (other than any 338(g) Elections) on the Closing Date other than in the
ordinary course of business, including but not limited to the distribution of
any dividend or the effectuation of any redemption that could give rise to any
Tax liability or reduce any Tax Asset of the Seller Group or give rise to any
loss of


                                       62
<PAGE>

any Seller or the Seller Group under this Agreement, (ii) to make any election
or deemed election under Section 338 of the Code or any comparable provision
under applicable law other than any election under Section 338(g) of the Code or
any comparable provision of applicable law with respect to the NIS Subsidiaries
(a "338(G) ELECTION"), (iii) to make or change any Tax election, amend any
Return or take any Tax position on any Return in each case with respect to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or (iv) to take any action, or enter into any
transaction, merger or restructuring with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period
(or portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date),
intentionally and with the actual knowledge of one or more senior managers of
such Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate (as the case may be) that such action,
transaction, merger or restructuring would result in any increased Tax liability
or reduction of any Tax Asset of any Seller or the Seller Group in respect of
any Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date. For purposes of this Section 8.05(a) and Section 8.05(d), Buyer
shall be obligated to indemnify Sellers in respect of any reduction of a Tax
Asset only as and when Sellers would otherwise have realized an actual reduction
in cash Taxes to be paid but for the reduction of such Tax Asset.

         (b) Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to the relevant Seller
or its relevant Affiliate all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by
Buyer or any Company or Subsidiary attributable to Taxes paid by any Seller or
any Company or Subsidiary (or any predecessor or Affiliates of any Seller) with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date, in each case, except (i) in respect of Other Taxes,
to the extent such Tax refunds are taken into account in the calculation of
Final Working Capital, (ii) in respect of Non-Consolidated Income Taxes, to the
extent in excess of the refund or overpayment taken into account in the
determination of an Aggregate Refund Amount under Section 8.03(e), or (iii)
arise from the carryback of any Tax attribute arising in a Post-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date)
provided that, Buyer shall not be obligated to pay Sellers for any such refund
if such refund (together with any related refunds) is for an amount of $150,000
or less. Upon the reasonable request of Sellers, Buyer and its Affiliates agree
to file all Returns (including amended Returns) or other documents claiming any
such refunds to which Sellers are entitled pursuant to the preceding sentence.

         (c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the sale of the Shares (including any real property transfer Tax
and any similar Tax) shall be borne and paid 50% by Buyer and 50% by Sellers.

         (d) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers and their
Affiliates against (i) any Tax incurred or suffered by any Seller or any of its


                                       63
<PAGE>

Affiliates, to the extent resulting from a breach of any covenant made by Buyer
contained in this Article 8, (ii) any Tax of any Company or Subsidiary relating
to a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date) and, subject to Sections 8.03(d) and 8.03(e), any Tax taken
into account (and to the extent) in the calculation of Final Working Capital,
and any liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable expenses of investigation and attorney's fees and expenses), arising
out of or incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax
described in clause (i) or (ii) above provided that, Buyer shall not be liable
for any (A) such Tax to the extent resulting from a breach of Section 8.05(f)
hereof and (B) any single claim (together with any related claims) with respect
to Taxes indemnified pursuant to Section 8.05(d) which results in a Loss of
$150,000 or less (and such claims shall not be aggregated for purposes of
Section 8.05(d) unless such claims are related). The Sellers agree to give
prompt notice to Buyer of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
action or proceeding, in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this
Section 8.05(d). Buyer may participate in any such suit, action or proceeding at
its own expense and the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution thereof. If Buyer's indemnification obligation under this Section
8.05(d) arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to a Seller or
any of its Affiliates any deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or
other allowance (a "TAX BENEFIT") which would not, but for such adjustment, be
allowable then the Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount by which such Tax
Benefit actually reduces in cash the amount of Tax that the Sellers or their
Affiliates would have been required to pay (or actually increases in cash the
amount of Tax refund to which the Sellers would have been entitled) but for such
adjustment. For purposes of determining the amount of any payment due to Buyer
pursuant to this Section 8.05(d), the Sellers shall be deemed to use all other
Tax Benefits of the Sellers and their Affiliates (to the extent that such Tax
Benefits are entitled to be used under applicable Tax law) prior to the use of
any Tax Benefits in respect of which Sellers are obligated to pay Buyer
hereunder. If, subsequent to any such payment, there shall be a Final
Determination which results in a disallowance or a reduction of such Tax
Benefit, Buyer shall repay to the Sellers, within 5 days of such event any
amount that would not have been payable to Buyer pursuant to this Section
8.05(d) had the amount of such Tax Benefit been determined in light of such
event.

         (e) Buyer shall have the right to make, or cause to be made, timely and
irrevocable 338(g) Elections. Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to take no position contrary thereto, except
to the extent required pursuant to a Final Determination.

         (f) Sellers covenant that from the date hereof until the Closing Date,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or required by
applicable law, they will not cause or permit any Company, Subsidiary or


                                       64
<PAGE>

Affiliate to take any action, or enter into any transaction, merger or
restructuring intentionally and with the actual knowledge of one or more senior
managers of the Sellers or such Company, Subsidiary or Affiliate (as the case
may be) that such action, transaction, merger or restructuring would result in
any increased Tax liability or reduction of any Tax Asset of any Company or
Subsidiary in respect of any Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date). For purposes of this Section 8.05(f),
a reduction in any Tax Asset shall be deemed to occur only as and when Buyer
would otherwise have realized an actual reduction in cash Taxes to be paid but
for the reduction of such Tax Assets.

         Section 8.06. Tax Sharing. Any and all existing Tax sharing agreements
between any Company or Subsidiary and any member of the Seller Group shall be
terminated as of the Closing Date. After such date, none of the Companies or
Subsidiaries, or the Sellers or their Affiliates, shall have any further rights
or liabilities thereunder. This Agreement shall be the sole such Tax sharing
agreement relating to any Company or Subsidiary for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods
and Straddle Periods.

         Section 8.07. Cooperation on Tax Matters. Buyer and the Sellers agree
to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon reasonable request, as
promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and
records) and assistance relating to the Companies and the Subsidiaries as is
reasonably necessary for the filing of any return (including any report required
pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder), for the preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or
defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment.
Buyer and the Sellers agree to retain or cause to be retained all books and
records pertinent to the Companies and the Subsidiaries until the applicable
period for assessment under applicable law (giving effect to any and all
extensions or waivers) has expired, and to abide by or cause the abidance with
all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries
to give the Sellers reasonable notice prior to transferring, discarding or
destroying any such books and records relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and,
if the Sellers so request, cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to allow the
Sellers to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and the Sellers
shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings
involving the Companies and the Subsidiaries for any Tax purposes and each shall
execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary
to carry out the intent of this subsection.

         Section 8.08. Tax Assets. Buyer agrees to carryforward any Tax Asset of
the Companies and their Subsidiaries arising in any Post-Closing Tax Period (or


                                       65
<PAGE>

portion of a Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date) to the extent
permitted by applicable law.

         Section 8.09. Indemnification by the Sellers. (a) The Sellers hereby
indemnify Buyer and, after the Closing, the Companies and the Subsidiaries,
against and agree to hold them harmless from any (i) to the extent Sellers have
not previously made a payment in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.03(b) or
Section 8.03(c) hereof, Tax of any Company or Subsidiary relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing
Date), (ii) any and all Tax losses of any Person relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (or portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date) imposed on
any Company or Subsidiary, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or
any analogous or similar state, local or foreign law or regulation or any Tax
sharing agreement or similar arrangement, as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise; (iii) any Tax losses based upon, attributable to or
resulting from any breach of any covenants made by Sellers in this Article 8,
(iv) any indemnity payment due to the Owner Participant pursuant to the Tax
Indemnity Agreement (a such term is defined in the Participation Agreement)
entered into in connection with the ONC Sale/Leaseback and any indemnity payment
due to any Tax Indemnitee (as such term is defined in the Participation
Agreement) pursuant to Section 10.2 (General Tax Indemnity) of the Participation
Agreement, in either case to the extent such indemnity payment arises out of, is
caused by, or results from any transactions contemplated by this Agreement or by
the Sublease Agreement; (v) any Tax arising as a result of the sale of the
Shares of ONC and the NIS Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 2.01(a) hereof; and
(vi) liabilities, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses), arising out of or
incident to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Tax, including
those incurred in the contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating
to the imposition, assessment or assertion of any such Tax, in each case
incurred or suffered by Buyer or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or
Subsidiary (the sum of (i) through (vi) being referred to as a "LOSS"); provided
that the Sellers shall have no liability for the payment of any Loss to the
extent resulting from a breach of Section 8.05(a) hereof, including, but not
limited to, an election made or deemed made by Buyer under Section 338 of the
Code or any comparable provision of applicable law (other than any 338((g)
Elections); and provided, further, that the Sellers shall be obligated to make
payments to Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.09, (i) in respect of Other Taxes,
only to the extent that the cumulative amount that would otherwise be payable by
the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.09(a) (notwithstanding this proviso)
exceeds the amount of the provisions for Other Tax liabilities taken into
account in the calculation of Final Working Capital less all payments made by
Sellers pursuant to Sections 8.03(b) and 8.03(c) hereof and (ii) in respect of
Non-Consolidated Income Taxes, only to the extent in excess of the Tax liability
in respect thereof taken into account in the determination of an


                                       66
<PAGE>

Aggregate Tax Liability Amount under Section 8.03(d); and provided further, that
no Seller shall be liable for any single claim (together with any related
claims) with respect to Tax indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.09(a) which
results in a Loss of $150,000 or less (and such claims shall not be aggregated
for purposes of this Section 8.09(a) unless such claims are related).

         (b) If the Sellers' indemnification obligation under this Section 8.09
arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer or, effective
upon the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary any Tax Benefit which would not, but
for such adjustment, be allowable, then Buyer shall, or shall cause the
applicable Company or Subsidiary to, pay to the Sellers the amount by which such
Tax Benefit actually reduces in cash the amount of Tax that Buyer, the Companies
or the Subsidiaries would have been required to pay (or actually increases in
cash the amount of Tax refund to which Buyer or any Company or Subsidiary would
have been entitled) but for such adjustment. For purposes of determining the
amount of any payment due to the Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.09(b), the
Companies and the Subsidiaries shall be deemed to use all other Tax Benefits of
the Companies or the Subsidiaries (to the extent that such Tax Benefits are
entitled to be used under applicable Tax law) prior to the use of any Tax
Benefits in respect of which Buyer is obligated to pay the Sellers hereunder.
If, subsequent to any such payment, there shall be a Final Determination which
results in a disallowance or a reduction of such Tax Benefit, the Sellers shall
repay to Buyer, within 5 days of such event any amount that would not have been
payable to Sellers pursuant to this Section 8.09(b) had the amount of such Tax
Benefit been determined in light of such event.

         (c) Unless otherwise provided for herein, any payment by the Sellers
pursuant to this Section 8.09 shall be made not later than 30 days after receipt
by the Sellers of written notice from Buyer stating that any Loss has been paid
by Buyer or, effective upon the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary and the
amount thereof and of the indemnity payment requested.

         (d) If any notice of audit, claim or demand (including any requests for
information, IDRs or similar preliminary administrative action) relating to
Taxes (a "TAX PROCEEDING") in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant
to this Section 8.09 is asserted in writing against Buyer or, effective upon the
Closing, any Company or Subsidiary, pertaining to such Taxes, Buyer shall notify
the Sellers of such notice, claim or demand within 10 days of receipt thereof,
or such earlier time that would allow the Sellers to timely respond to such
claim or demand, and shall give the Sellers such information with respect
thereto as the Sellers may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the
Sellers shall relieve the Buyer of its obligations hereunder, but only to the
extent that such failure shall have adversely prejudiced the Sellers. The
Sellers may discharge, at any time, their indemnification obligation under this
Section 8.09 arising from such Tax



                                       67
<PAGE>

Proceeding, calculated on the date of such payment assuming that the Taxing
Authority would be successful with respect to the matters asserted in such Tax
Proceeding. The Sellers may, at their own expense, participate in and, upon
notice to Buyer, assume the defense of any such Tax Proceeding. If the Sellers
assume such defense, the Sellers shall have the sole discretion as to the
conduct of such defense provided that the Sellers shall not settle any claim
that may have a material effect in a Post-Closing Tax Period without the consent
of Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall have the right (but not
the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its
own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Sellers. Whether or not
the Sellers choose to defend or prosecute any claim, (i) all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and (ii) Buyer
shall not settle any Tax Proceeding or pay any tax in respect of which indemnity
may be sought pursuant to this Section 8.09 without the Sellers' prior written
consent, not to be unreasonably withheld.

         Section 8.10. Purchase Price Adjustment. Unless otherwise required by
applicable law, any amount paid by the Sellers or Buyer under Article 8 or
Article 11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

         Section 8.11. No Duplicate Liability. Neither party will be liable for
a Tax under this Article 8 more than once.

                                   ARTICLE 9
                                EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         Section 9.01. Employee Benefits. (a) Buyer shall and shall cause the
Companies and the Subsidiaries to: (i) until December 31, 2004, subject to
applicable law, provide (x) to each employee of the Companies and the
Subsidiaries who is an employee thereof as of the Closing Date (the "TRANSFERRED
EMPLOYEE") base salary and cash bonus opportunities that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Transferred Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (y) to the Transferred Employees
employee benefits (other than equity-based compensation and benefits provided
pursuant to supplemental, non-qualified pension and retirement arrangements)
that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to the
Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, provided that this
clause (i) shall not apply to any employees represented by a union or employee
association for purposes of collective bargaining and, (ii) until December 31,
2004, subject to applicable law, continue, without any change adverse to the
Transferred Employees, each severance plan, arrangement or policy identified in
Schedule 9.01.


                                       68
<PAGE>

         (b) Each Transferred Employee will receive, or will not forfeit,
service credit for all periods of employment with a Company or Subsidiary or any
predecessor thereof prior to the Closing Date to the same extent and for all
purposes under any employee benefit plan in which such employee participates
after the Closing Date, to the extent that such service was recognized under any
analogous plan of such Company or Subsidiary in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date; provided that any benefit of a Transferred Employee under any
defined benefit pension plan of Buyer or any of its Affiliates may be reduced to
the extent such benefit is duplicative of the benefit provided to such
Transferred Employee under a defined benefit plan covering such employee prior
to the Closing Date.

         (c) If on or after the Closing Date, any Transferred Employee becomes
covered under any benefit plan providing medical, dental, health, pharmaceutical
or vision benefits (a "SUCCESSOR PLAN"), other than the plan in which he or she
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date (a "PRIOR PLAN"), any such
Successor Plan shall not include any restrictions or limitations with respect to
any pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements (except
to the extent such exclusions or requirements were applicable under the
corresponding Prior Plan), and any eligible expenses incurred by such
Transferred Employee and his or her covered dependents during the calendar year
in which the Transferred Employee becomes covered under any Successor Plan shall
be taken into account under any such Successor Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and/or his or her covered dependents for that year, to the extent
that such expenses were incurred during a period in which the Transferred
Employee or covered dependent was covered under a corresponding Prior Plan.

         (d) Except as otherwise specifically set forth above, nothing contained
herein shall be construed as requiring Buyer or its Affiliates to continue any
specific Employee Plan, or to continue the employment of any specific person;
provided that any changes Buyer or its Affiliates may make to any such Employee
Plan are permitted by the terms of the applicable Employee Plan and under any
applicable law.

                              CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

         Section 10.01. Conditions to Obligations of the Parties. The
obligations of Buyer and the Sellers to consummate the Closing are subject to

         hereby are compatible with the common market.

                  (c) Any applicable waiting periods under the Canadian
         Competition Act shall have expired or been terminated.

         of the Closing.

                  (e) All other material actions by or in respect of or material
         filings with any Governmental Authority required to permit the
         consummation of the Closing shall have been taken, made or obtained,
         except for any such actions or filings the failure to take, make or
         obtain would not be material to the Companies and the Subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole.

         Section 10.02. Conditions to Obligations of Buyer. The obligation of
Buyer to consummate the Closing is subject to the satisfaction of the following
further conditions:

                  (a) (i) The Sellers shall have performed in all material
         respects all of their obligations hereunder required to be performed by

         warranties of the Sellers contained in this Agreement and in any
         certificate or other writing delivered by the Sellers pursuant hereto,
         disregarding all qualifications and exceptions contained therein
         relating to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (except to the
         extent any such representation or warranty requires disclosure of lists
         of items of a material nature or above a specified threshold), shall be
         true at and as of the Closing Date, as if made at and as of such date
         (except to the extent a representation or warranty is expressly made as
         of an earlier date, in which case such representation or warranty shall
         be true at and as of such date), with only such exceptions as would not
         in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
         Effect and (iii) Buyer shall have received a certificate in the form of
         Exhibit D hereto signed by an executive officer of each Seller to the
         foregoing effect.

         Sellers, the Companies and the Subsidiaries and the authority of the
         Sellers for this Agreement, all in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to Buyer.

agreements shall survive indefinitely). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
covenant, agreement, representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity

to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to such time.

         Section 11.02. Indemnification. (a) Each Seller hereby indemnifies

breach of warranty contained in this Agreement (excluding Section 8.01, other
than Section 8.01(vii), (viii) and (ix)) (each such misrepresentation and breach
of warranty, including any claim arising in connection with any alleged
inaccuracy in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, a "WARRANTY
BREACH"), (ii) breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed by such
Seller pursuant

(other than any Warranty Breach with respect to Sections 3.05, 3.06, 3.07 and

aggregate amount of Damages with respect to such Warranty Breaches (together

shall be liable for all Damages in excess thereof (subject to clause (C)), (B)
no Seller shall be liable for any single claim or series of related claims with
respect to Warranty Breaches which result in Damages of $150,000 or less (and
such claims shall not be aggregated for purposes of the immediately preceding
clause (A)) and (C) the Sellers' maximum liability for all such Warranty
Breaches shall not exceed $420,000,000 in the aggregate; provided further that
with respect to indemnification by the Sellers for Kwik-N-Clean pursuant to this
Section, (x) no Seller shall be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages

$5,000,000, the Sellers shall be liable for $0.50 of each $1.00 of such Damages
in excess of $5,000,000 up to $10,000,000 and (z) the Sellers shall be liable
for all such Damages in excess of $10,000,000. In addition, each Seller hereby
indemnifies Buyer and, after the Closing, the Companies and the Subsidiaries,
against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all Damages
incurred by any of them arising out of or otherwise relating to the failure of
any Seller or any of its Affiliates to comply with applicable Indian laws or
regulations or listing requirements relating to any obligation of such Seller or
Affiliates to acquire shares of Ondeo India, to the extent that such Damages
relate to or arise out of pre-Closing events (excluding the transactions
contemplated hereby and excluding Damages relating to or arising from any act or
omission by Buyer). Each Seller also hereby indemnifies Buyer and, after the
Closing, the Companies and the Subsidiaries, against any and all Damages arising
out of (i) given the termination of any contractual relationship between the
Companies and Mars & Company, any claims made by Mars & Company with respect to
fees that may be owed to Mars & Company by the Companies and the Subsidiaries in
respect of any agreement or arrangement entered into prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) the Acquisition Earn-outs.

         (b) Buyer hereby indemnifies each Seller and its Affiliates against and

                                       73

made or to be performed pursuant to Article 8); provided that with respect to
indemnification by Buyer for any Warranty Breach pursuant to this Section, (i)
Buyer shall not be liable unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to
such Warranty Breaches exceeds $30,000,000 and then, until the aggregate amount
of Damages exceeds $60,000,000 Buyer shall be liable for $0.50 for each $1.00 of
incremental Damages, and, once the aggregate amount of such Damages exceeds
$60,000,000, Buyer shall be liable for all Damages in excess thereof (subject to
clause (iii)), (ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any single claim or series of
related claims with respect to Warranty Breaches which results in Damages of

shall not exceed $420,000,000 in the aggregate.

         Section 11.03. Procedures. (a) The party seeking indemnification under
Section 11.02 (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") agrees to give prompt notice to the
party against whom indemnity is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") of the
assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding
("CLAIM") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and
will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent (and only to the extent) such failure shall have
adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party in any material respect.

         (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any Claim asserted by any third party ("THIRD PARTY CLAIM") and,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, and so long as the
Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for Damages related to such Third Party Claim, shall be entitled to
control and appoint lead counsel for such defense, in each case at its expense.

         (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense
of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section
11.03, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim,
if the settlement does not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities
and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes
injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party and (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third
Party Claim and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that such Indemnified Party will be entitled to
participate in any such defense with separate counsel at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party if (i) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate
or (ii) in the reasonable


                                       74
<PAGE>

opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make
such separate representation advisable; and provided further, that the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay for more than one such counsel in
any jurisdiction for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any Third Party
Claim.

         (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as
may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

         (e) Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any
amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

         Section 11.04. Calculation of Damages. (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible therefor covering
Damages in respect of which indemnification may be sought under Section 11.01.
The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to collect any amounts
available under such insurance policies and from such other Person alleged to be
responsible. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party,
then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for
any such indemnification payment up to the amount received by the Indemnified
Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such
amount, but, in the case of amounts received under applicable insurance
policies, only to the extent such payments, together with all similar amounts
previously received, are in excess of the aggregate deductibles or retentions
under such insurance policies.

         (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for
any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that the amount of such
Damages is reflected in the calculation of Final Working Capital, Final
Indebtedness or any purchase price adjustment made pursuant to Section 2.01(c),
(ii) consequential or punitive Damages (other than consequential or punitive
Damages payable to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim) and
(iii) Damages for lost profits (other than Damages incurred in connection with a
Third Party Claim in respect of lost profits of the third party bringing such
claim).

         Section 11.05. Assignment of Claims. If the Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Damages pursuant to
Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of
such Damages from a third party (a "POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTOR") based on the
underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as
are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

         Section 11.06. Exclusivity. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, Buyer waives any rights and claims Buyer
may have against the Sellers, whether in law or in equity, relating to the
Companies, the Subsidiaries or the Shares or the transactions contemplated
hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer include, without limitation,
claims for contribution or other rights of recovery arising out of or relating
to any Environmental Law, claims for breach of contract, breach of
representation or warranty, negligent misrepresentation and all other claims for
breach of duty. After the Closing, Section 8.09 and Section 11.02 will provide
the exclusive remedy for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, covenant or
other agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will limit
any claim based upon fraud.

terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

                  (a) by mutual written agreement of the Sellers and Buyer;

                  (b) by any of the Sellers or Buyer if the Closing shall not
         have been consummated on or before December 31, 2003; provided that the
         right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause 12.01(b)
         shall not be available to any party whose failure to perform or observe
         in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement
         shall have been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the
         Closing to occur on or before such date;

                  (c) by any of the Sellers or Buyer if consummation of the
         transactions contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final
         order, decree or judgment of any court or Governmental Authority having
         competent jurisdiction;


                                       76
<PAGE>

                  (d) by Buyer or any Seller, if Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for
         the LTM as set forth on the Adjusted EBITDA Schedule delivered pursuant
         to Section 5.04(c)(iii) shall be less than $500,000,000; provided that
         the right of Buyer or any Seller to terminate this Agreement pursuant
         to this Section 12.01(d) must be exercised within 10 business days
         following delivery of the Adjusted EBITDA Schedule to Buyer pursuant to
         Section 5.04(c)(iii);

                  (e) by Buyer, if the Sellers fail to deliver to Buyer (i) by
         October 22, 2003, the Reviewed June Financial Statements and the June
         Comfort Letter pursuant to Section 5.04(d) or (ii) by November 15,
         2003, the Reviewed September Financial Statements and the September
         Comfort Letter pursuant to Section 5.04(f); or

                  (f) by Buyer or any Seller if the Sellers shall have failed to

         written certification to the effect that the Board of Directors of Suez
         has approved the transactions contemplated hereby.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (b), (c),
(d), (e) or (f) of this Section 12.01 shall give notice of such termination to
the other party. In the event any Seller gives notice terminating this Agreement
pursuant to Section 12.01(d), within five business days of receiving the
termination notice, Buyer may by written notice to the Sellers render such
termination notice null and void, in which event this Agreement will remain in
full force and effect, except that the downward Purchase Price adjustment

         Section 12.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant
or representative of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; provided
that if such termination shall result from the willful (i) failure of either
party to fulfill a condition to the performance of the obligations of the other
party, (ii) failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by
either party hereto of any representation or warranty or agreement contained
herein, such party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or
suffered by the other party as a result of such failure or breach. The
provisions of Sections 3.19, 4.09, 7.07 13.04, 13.06, 13.08, 13.09 and 13.10 (as
well as the provisions of this Section 12.02) shall survive any termination
hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.

such item or matter in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to

to be effective.

         (b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the

herein, the rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

         Section 13.04. Termination Fee; Expenses. (a) Except as otherwise

Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the
State of New York, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the
jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom)
in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the

that any such suit, action or proceeding which is brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or
proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each
party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 13.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

         Section 13.13. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated

a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
