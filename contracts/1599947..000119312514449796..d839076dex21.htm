adjusted is hereinafter referred to as the " _Purchase Price._ "

(d) Notwithstanding the actual Closing Date(s), the parties agree that the
Buyers are purchasing, subject to the applicable Closings occurring, the
economic interests of the Transferred Companies effective as of the Economic
Interests Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the receipt by the Transferred Companies of all revenues
received in the ordinary course of business, and the payment by the
Transferred Companies of any Liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business, will not be included in the calculation of Lock-Box Distributions.
At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver to the Buyers a certificate setting forth an estimate of the
Preliminary Purchase Price, which shall include the Sellers calculation of
the Lock-Box Adjustment, if any, along with any supporting work papers and
documentation evidencing any transactions during the Lock-Box Period deemed to
constitute a Lock-Box Contribution or Lock-Box Distribution, and the Sellers
calculation of any Working Capital Overage or Working Capital Underage
(prepared in accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules), as applicable, as of
the Initial Closing (the " _Working Capital Estimate_ " and, collectively
with the Lock-Box Adjustment, the " _Adjustment Amount Estimate_ "); provided
that the Parties agree that the Sellers may assume a date, in its reasonable
discretion, for the date of a Second Closing, if applicable, and include in
the calculation of the Lock-Box Adjustment and the Working Capital Estimate
the Current Assets and Current Liabilities associated with AIV E and Holdings
5, and their respective Subsidiaries. Such certificate shall be prepared by
the Sellers in good faith and be accompanied by reasonably detailed
supporting documentation. Within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of
the Adjustment Amount Estimate by the Sellers to the Buyers, the Buyers may
object in good faith to the Adjustment Amount Estimate in writing. If the
Buyers object to the Adjustment Amount Estimate within such five (5) Business
Day period, the Parties shall attempt to resolve their differences by
negotiation. If the Parties are unable to do so prior the Initial Closing
Date (or if the Buyers do not object to the Adjustment Amount Estimate), the
Preliminary Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Initial Closing by the amount
of the Adjustment Amount Estimate not in dispute. The disputed portion shall
be resolved in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.7_ and paid as
part of any Final Statement.

available funds, at the Initial Closing by (a) funding an amount into an
escrow account (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to
the Indemnity Escrow Agreement equal to (i) five percent (5%) of the
Preliminary Purchase Price if the Buyer Insurance Policy is in place as of the
Initial Closing Date in accordance with _Section 6.19_ or (ii) fifteen
percent (15%) of the Preliminary Purchase Price if the Buyer Insurance Policy
is not in place as of the Initial Closing Date in accordance with _Section
6.19_, (b) funding an amount into an escrow account (the " _Purchase Price
Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the Purchase Price Escrow

and the Shaffer Project (the " _Second Closing Amount_ "); and (c) paying the
remainder to the Sellers based on the Ownership Percentage of each Seller, as

_6.29_ shall be paid to the Buyers by the Sellers, by wire of immediately
funds, on the Initial Closing Date (or such other date specified in the
applicable Section), and the amounts so paid shall not constitute an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. The Buyers shall prepare and submit to the

Business Day prior to the Initial Closing Date, a closing statement specifying
the flow of funds to be paid at the Initial Closing.

2.7 _Lock-Box Adjustment and Working Capital Adjustment_.

this _Section 2.7._ The _"Adjustment Amount"_ equals the sum of (i) the
difference between Actual Working Capital and Working Capital Estimate, and
(ii) the difference between the Lock-Box Adjustment paid at the Initial
Closing and any adjustment thereto pursuant to this _Section 2.7. _Within
sixty (60) days after the first to occur of the Full Closing Date, the Second
Closing Date or, the Expiration Date if there is no Full Closing Date or
Second Closing Date, the Buyers shall deliver to the Sellers (i) a statement
setting forth a consolidated balance sheet of the Transferred Companies as of
the Economic Interests Closing Date (the  _"Economic Interests Closing Date
Pro Forma Financial Statements")_ prepared in accordance with GAAP and the
Sellers historic practices applied on the same basis as applied in the
preparation of the Working Capital Estimate (and in accordance with the
Balance Sheet Rules) and (ii) a statement showing in reasonable detail their
calculation of Working Capital as of the Economic Interests Closing Date,
their calculation of all Lock-Box Contributions and Lock-Box Distributions
(if different from the Sellers), and their calculation of any Adjustment
Amount, together with supporting work papers (the _"Adjustment Statement")_ as
of such Closing Date. The Adjustment Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with the Balance Sheet Rules.

(b) During the forty-five (45) day period following the Sellers receipt of
the Adjustment Statement, the Sellers and their advisors (including
accountants) shall be provided access to the relevant books, records and
employees of the Transferred Companies to the extent required in connection
with their review of and any dispute with respect to the Adjustment Statement
and the Buyers shall furnish the Sellers with any other information that might
be relevant to the calculation of the Adjustment Amount; _provided_ that the
Sellers and 

 



22  their advisors (including accountants) shall have executed all release
letters reasonably requested by the Buyers accountants in connection
therewith. The Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
Parties on the expiration of such forty-five (45) day period, unless the
Sellers give written notice of their specific disagreement with respect to
such Adjustment Statement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to the Buyers
prior to such date (the " _Review Period_ "). Any Notice of Disagreement shall
specify in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted, along
with a calculation and amount of the disputed item. Any items on the
Adjustment Statement as to which the Sellers have not given notice of
objection will be deemed to have been agreed upon by the Parties. If a Notice
of Disagreement is delivered to the Buyers within the Review Period with
respect to the Adjustment Statement, then such Adjustment Statement (as
revised in accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding upon
the Parties on the earlier of (A) the Buyers and the Sellers resolving in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in
the applicable Notice of Disagreement and (B) the date any disputed matters
are finally resolved in writing by an independent accounting firm (the "
_Accounting Firm_ ") in accordance with this _Section 2.7(b)_. During the
fifteen (15) day period following the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement,
the Buyers and the Sellers shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in
the Notice of Disagreement and any resolution of the Parties during such time
will be final and binding. If any items remain in dispute at the end of such
fifteen (15) day period, the Parties shall, within fifteen (15) days, submit
to the Accounting Firm for arbitration, in accordance with this _Section
2.7(b)_, only matters that remain in dispute and were properly included in the
Notice of Disagreement in accordance with this _Section 2.7(b)_, in the form
of a written brief. In the event that either Party fails to submit its brief
regarding items in dispute within such time period, then the Accounting Firm
shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely submitted by the
other Party. The Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized independent
public accounting firm as shall be reasonably agreed upon by the Buyers and
the Sellers in writing. The Buyers or the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a written decision
resolving the matters submitted to the Accounting Firm within fourteen (14)
days of the receipt of such submission. The scope of the disputes to be
resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be limited to determining only those
items in dispute. The Accounting Firms decision shall be based solely on
written submissions by the Buyers and the Sellers and their
respective Representatives and not by independent review. The Accounting Firm
shall not hold any hearings, hear any oral testimony or otherwise seek or
require any other evidence. The Accounting Firm may not assign a value greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by any Party or smaller than
the smallest value for such item claimed by a Party. The resolution of
disputed items by the Accounting Firm shall constitute an arbitral award that
is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered
by a court having jurisdiction thereover. The Accounting Firm shall also
determine, as part of such dispute resolution, the respective liability of the
Buyers and the Sellers as to payment of the costs and expenses of
such Accounting Firm, based on the following formula: the Buyers and the
Sellers shall each pay the percentage of the costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm in settling the disputed matters set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement equal to (i) the aggregate amount of such disputed matters (as
determined by reference to the potential impact of such disputed matters on
the Purchase Price) submitted to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully
disputed by such Party (as finally determined by the Accounting Firm)
_divided by_ (ii) the aggregate amount of all such disputed matters (as
determined by reference to the potential

 



23  impact of such disputed matters on the Purchase Price) submitted to the
Accounting Firm. The Parties shall cooperate with each other and the
Accounting Firm regarding the resolution of any disagreement with respect to
the Adjustment Statement, such cooperation to include reasonable access to
books, records, facilities and personnel. This provision shall constitute the
exclusive remedy of the Parties with respect to determination of the Final
Statement. A " _Final Statement_ " shall be, with respect to the Adjustment
Statement: (i) such Adjustment Statement if no Notice of Disagreement is
delivered to the Buyers during the Review Period or (ii) such Adjustment
Statement as adjusted by (A) the written agreement of the Buyers and the
Sellers or (B) the Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section 2.7(b)_.

 

(c) If the Adjustment Amount as set forth on the Final Statement is greater
than the Adjustment Amount Estimate applicable to such Final Statement, the
Buyers shall, within ten (10) Business Days after such Final Statement becomes
final and binding on the Parties, make payment of such difference to the
Sellers, based on the Ownership Percentage of each Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds as the Sellers direct together with
interest of the amount of such difference at the Default Interest Rate
accruing from the Closing Date to the date of payment. If the Adjustment
Amount as set forth on a Final Statement is less than the Adjustment Amount
Estimate applicable to such Final Statement, then the Sellers shall, within
ten (10) Business Days after such Final Statement becomes final and binding on
the Parties, make payment to the Buyers by wire transfer of immediately
available funds of the amount of such difference, together with interest of
the amount of such difference at the Default Interest Rate accruing from the
Closing Date to the date of payment.

 

(d) Following the Initial Closing or Second Closing, as applicable, through
the date the Adjustment Statement or Final Statement becomes final and
binding on the Parties, the Buyers shall not take any action with respect to
the accounting books and records of the applicable Transferred Companies, or
the items reflected thereon, on which such Adjustment Statement is to be
based, that is inconsistent with such Transferred Companies past practices.
During the period of time from and after the Initial Closing Date or Second
Closing Date, as applicable, through the date the Adjustment Statement becomes
final and binding on the Parties, the Buyers shall afford, and shall cause
the applicable Transferred Companies to afford, to the Sellers and any of
their accountants, counsel or financial advisors retained in connection with
the determination of the applicable Adjustment Amount in accordance with this
_Section 2.7_, upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times and in such
manner as will not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
the applicable Transferred Companies, direct access during normal business
hours to all the books, contracts, personnel, Representatives (including the
Transferred Companies accountants) and records of the applicable Transferred
Companies and such Representatives (including the work papers of the
Transferred Companies accountants) relevant to the preparation of the
Adjustment Statement, and the determination of the Adjustment Amount in
accordance with this _Section 2.7_ as the Sellers reasonably request;
_provided_  that (i) the Sellers and their advisors (including accountants)
shall have executed all release letters reasonably requested by the Buyers
accountants in connection therewith, (ii) the Buyers shall have the right to
have a Representative present for any such access; and (iii) the Buyers shall
not be required to provide access to any information that is (A) subject to
attorney-client or other applicable privilege to the extent doing so would
reasonably be expected to cause such privilege to be waived, or (B)
prohibited by applicable Law. The Sellers shall treat all information obtained
from or on behalf of the Buyers as Buyer Confidential Information in
accordance with the terms hereof.

for release by written authorization of the disclosing Party, or (C) is
required to be disclosed by the receiving Party pursuant to a legal process
(so long as the receiving Party uses commercially reasonable efforts to avoid
disclosure of such information, and prior to furnishing such information, the
receiving Party notifies the disclosing Party and gives the disclosing Party
the opportunity to object to the disclosure and/or to seek a protective
order). Nothing in this Agreement shall bar the right of either Party to seek
and obtain from any court injunctive relief against conduct or threatened
conduct which violates this _Section 6.1_.

 

(b) _Post-Closing Period_. If a Closing occurs from and after each Closing
Date, the Buyers and the Sellers shall hold and protect, and shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause their Affiliates and Representatives to hold and
protect the Confidential Information as each protects other documents of
similar nature in the course of their regular operations. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, after the Initial Closing Date or Second Closing Date, as
applicable, the applicable information described in _Section 6.1(a)(ii)(b)_
and _(c)_ shall no longer be Seller Confidential Information. CD AIV, Inc.
and its Affiliates and principals shall be entitled to disclose in marketing
materials shared with existing and potential investors the Purchase Price and
such other information relating to this Agreement as is disclosed in any
public filing made by the Buyers or their Affiliates with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

(c) The Parties obligations to maintain the confidentiality of the
Confidential Information as required hereunder shall continue for a period of
five (5) years following the first to occur of the date this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms or the Initial Closing Date.

6.8 _Payments in Respect of LandPro Projects Tax Equity Financing_.

by and among Tenant 3, AIV E, CD US Solar PO 3, LLC, a Delaware limited

US Solar MT 3, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Tenant 3_ "), of
the Second Installment Capital Contribution (as defined in the ECCA), the

6.9 _Risk of Loss_. During the period between the Effective Date and the
applicable Closing Date (or the earlier termination of this Agreement) (the
"Interim Period"), all risk of loss or damage to the Properties that are the
subject of such Closing shall, as between the Buyers and the Sellers, be borne
by the Sellers. If any Properties are damaged or destroyed by fire, theft,
vandalism, or other casualty (each such event, an "Event of Loss"), or are
taken by a Governmental Body by Condemnation, then the following provisions of
this _Section 6.9_ shall apply:

 



48 (a) If at any time before the applicable Closing Date any applicable Project
that is the subject of the Closing on such Closing Date, in whole or in part,
becomes subject to or is threatened with a Condemnation, the Sellers shall
notify the Buyers promptly in writing of such fact. If such Condemnation would
create a Transferred Company Material Adverse Effect, then unless the Sellers
direct the Buyers to seek permission under the applicable Tax Equity Documents
to cause such Project to be excluded from the portfolio subject to such Tax
Equity Documents and agree to compensate the Buyers for all costs, expenses
and Losses incurred in connection with seeking such permission and excluding
the Project from the portfolio subject to such Tax Equity Documents (which
compensation obligation shall not be subject to any limitation of liability
under _Section 8.4(b)_), the Sellers shall, upon the applicable Closing, (i)
assign to the Buyers any claim, settlement or proceeds thereof with respect to
the applicable Project and contribute to the Buyers such additional funds as
may be necessary to fully compensate the Buyers for all lost revenue
associated with the Condemnation (determined based on the estimated production
of such Project as agreed by the Parties or as set forth in the report of such
independent engineer). If the Sellers provide the direction set forth in the
preceding sentence and the Buyers obtain permission under the applicable Tax
Equity Documents to exclude such Project from the portfolio subject to such
Tax Equity Documents, then the applicable Project shall be excluded from the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the amount set forth on _Annex 1.1(i)_ corresponding to such
Project, and the Buyers shall pay over any proceeds they receive in respect
of such Condemnation to the Sellers (if any). If such Condemnation would not
create a Transferred Company Material Adverse Effect, then the Buyers shall
receive from the Sellers an assignment of any claim, settlement or proceeds
thereof with respect to the applicable Project and proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If at any time before the applicable Closing Date any applicable Project
that is the subject of the Closing on such Closing Date is damaged or
destroyed in any material respect by one or more Events of Loss, then unless
the Sellers direct the Buyers to seek permission under the applicable Tax
Equity Documents to cause such Project to be excluded from the portfolio
subject to such Tax Equity Documents and agree to compensate the Buyers for
all costs, expenses and Losses incurred in connection with seeking such
permission and excluding the Project from the portfolio subject to such Tax
Equity Documents (which compensation obligation shall not be subject to any
limitation of liability under _Section 8.4(b)_), the Sellers shall, upon the
applicable Closing, (i) contribute such funds as may be necessary (as mutually
determined by the Parties or, if they are unable to reach agreement, by an
independent engineer mutually acceptable to the Parties) to supplement
insurance proceeds available in respect of such Event of Loss to (A) repair
or replace the damaged Project to a good operating condition and otherwise
satisfying the representations and warranties contained in the Agreement, and
(B) fully compensate the Buyers for all lost revenue associated with the
Event of Loss (determined based on the estimated production of such Project
for the period the Event of Loss impacts production as agreed by the Parties
or as set forth in the report of such independent engineer), and (ii) the
Sellers shall pay over such insurance proceeds they receive in respect of such
Event of Loss (if any) to the Buyers. If the Sellers provide the direction set
forth in the preceding sentence and the Buyers obtain permission under the
applicable Tax Equity Documents to exclude such Project from the portfolio
subject to such Tax Equity Documents, then the applicable Project shall be
excluded from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the amount set forth on _Annex 1.1(i)_

 



49  corresponding to such Project, and the Buyers shall pay over any insurance
proceeds they receive in respect of such Event of Loss to the Sellers (if
any). For purposes of this  _Section 6.9(b)_, "material respect" means that
either (A) the projected cost of repair (as determined by the Parties or, if
they are unable to reach agreement, by an independent engineer mutually
acceptable to the Parties) of such Project is more than ten percent (10%) of
the amount set forth on _Annex 1.1(i)_ corresponding to such Project, or (ii)
the projected time for the complete repair of such Project (as determined by
the Parties or, if they are unable to reach agreement, by an independent
engineer mutually acceptable to the Parties) would give rise under a Material
Contract to a counterpartys right of termination for force majeure. In the
case of an Event of Loss that does not damage or destroy a Project in any
material respect, upon the applicable Closing the Sellers shall pay over to
the Buyers all proceeds of applicable insurance they receive in respect of
such Event of Loss (if any) and such other funds contributed by the Sellers
that are sufficient (as mutually determined by the Parties or, if they are
unable to reach agreement, by an independent engineer mutually acceptable to
the Parties) to (A) repair or replace the damaged Project to a good
operating condition and otherwise satisfying the representations and
warranties contained in the Agreement, and (B) fully compensate the Buyers for
all lost revenue associated with the Event of Loss (determined based on the
estimated production of such Project for the period the Event of Loss impacts
production as mutually agreed by the Parties or as set forth in the report of
the independent engineer).

 

6.10 _Further Assurances_. If at any time after a Closing Date any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Parties
shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to take all such necessary
actions.

6.11 _Indemnification of Members, Officers and Others_.

(a) For a period of three (3) years after the Initial Closing Date with
respect to those Transferred Companies that are the subject of the Closing
thereon or the Second Closing Date with respect to those Transferred Companies
that are subject of the Closing thereon, the Buyers shall cause the applicable
Transferred Companies to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, in accordance
with its respective Transferred Company Operating Documents to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Laws, the individuals who on or prior to
such Closing Date were members, managers or officers of such Transferred
Companies (collectively, the " _Special Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such. All rights of the
Special Indemnitees to indemnifications and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Initial Closing Date or the
Second Closing Date, as applicable, (including provisions respecting the
advancement of expenses) as provided in the Transferred Company Operating
Documents as now in effect, and any of the indemnification agreements or
arrangements of the applicable Transferred Companies set forth in _Section
6.11(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter shall survive the Initial Closing
Date or Second Closing Date, as applicable, and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of three (3) years
from the Initial Closing Date or the Second Closing Date, as applicable, such
rights shall not be amended, or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights of the Special Indemnitees, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
breach of a representation or warranty made by the Sellers herein or any
indemnification obligations owing by the Sellers hereunder shall not be deemed
for any reason to be a claim covered by indemnification or advancement of
expenses owing to such Special Indemnitee under this Agreement, any Law,
certificate of organization, bylaw or comparable document or other agreement
whatsoever.

 



50 (b) Each of the Buyers and the Special Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate,
and cause their respect Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense of any claim
and shall provide reasonable access to properties and individuals as
reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information
and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trial or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.11_: (i) are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Special Indemnitee and his or
her legal heirs; and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

(d) In the event that within the three (3) year period commencing immediately
after the Closing Date, any of the Buyers or any of the Transferred Companies
or any of their successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made for the satisfaction of the
obligations of the Buyers and such Transferred Company to the Special
Indemnitees under this _Section 6.11_.

(e) The obligations of the Buyers under this _Section 6.11_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Special
Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies without the consent of the
affected Special Indemnitee, it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees
to whom this _Section 6.11_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 6.11_.

 

6.12 _Inter-Company Indebtedness and Agreements_. The Sellers shall deliver to
the Buyers, at each Closing, (a) such payoff letters or other documents or
evidence as the Buyers may reasonably request in order to evidence that all
intercompany account obligations (including Indebtedness) of the applicable
Transferred Companies will have been extinguished and paid in full
without further liability to the Buyers or any such Transferred Company, and
(b) such termination agreements or other documents or evidence as the Buyer
may reasonably request in order to evidence that all contracts and other
agreements between any such Transferred Company and any Seller or any
Affiliate of any Seller (other than another Transferred Company) (including
any pledge agreements related to the payoff of all intercompany account
obligations) have been terminated without further liability to the Buyers or
such Transferred Company.

6.13 _Investigation by the Buyers_. During the Interim Period the Sellers
shall (i) provide the Buyers with reasonable access to and the right to
inspect and perform noninvasive sampling of all Properties and to inspect all
books and records and other documents and data of the Transferred Companies;
(ii) furnish the Buyers with such financial, operating and other data and
information related to the Transferred Companies as the Buyers may reasonably
request and that is in the possession or control of the Sellers; (iii) upon
reasonable notice to the Sellers, permit the Buyers to interview managerial
personnel familiar with the Transferred Companies generally; (iv) instruct the
advisors, consultants and other Representatives of the Sellers to

 



51  cooperate with the Buyers in their investigation of the Transferred
Companies and their assets; (v) provide the Buyers with copies of any proposed
amendment to any Contract and any proposed new Contract, regardless of
whether prior written consent of the Buyer relating thereto is required by
_Section 6.14_; and (vi) provide the Buyers with copies of any correspondence
or notice asserting or threatening the assertion of a default under or
termination of any Material Contract. No investigation by the Buyers or
information received by the Buyers shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement given or made by
the Sellers in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers
shall not be required to provide any information that is (A) subject to
attorney-client privilege to the extent doing so would cause such privilege to
be waived, (B) prohibited to be disclosed by Law or (iii) subject to
contractual prohibitions against disclosure to the extent doing so would
violate such prohibition (after the Sellers have used reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of the other party to disclose such information and such
consent has been denied).

6.14 _Certain Restrictions_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in the Transition Services Agreement and as set forth
in _Section 6.14_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, during the Interim
Period, unless otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the Sellers

applicable, consistent with past practice, to maintain the assets of each
Transferred Company in the ordinary course of business consistent with the

shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed):

(i) entering into any Contract that would be a Material Contract if in
existence on the date hereof or amending, modifying or terminating (partially

(ii) incurring, assuming, guaranteeing, or otherwise becoming liable in
respect of any obligation or Liability except in the ordinary course of

the aggregate an amount in excess of $250,000;

 



52 (iii) selling, leasing, transferring or disposing of or acquiring, or

(c) During the applicable Interim Period each of the Sellers shall refrain

6.15 _Seller Disclosure Letter Update_. From time to time during the
applicable Interim Period, the Sellers may at their option supplement or
amend and deliver updates to any Section of the Seller Disclosure Letter that
has been rendered inaccurate or incomplete since the

 



53  Effective Date solely as a result of matters or events first occurring after
the Effective Date as necessary to complete or correct any information
therein; for the avoidance of doubt, Sections that are inaccurate or
incomplete due to events or matters occurring prior to the Effective Date as
to which the Sellers first gained knowledge after the Effective Date are not
eligible to be updated. The Sellers shall provide the Buyers with any such
supplement or amendment by written notice (each, a " _Seller Disclosure Letter
Update_ ") in accordance with _Section 11.2_. Prior to the Initial Closing
Date, if the matters identified in a Seller Disclosure Letter Update,
individually or collectively with matters identified in any other Seller
Disclosure Letter Update, constitute a Portfolio Material Adverse Effect, then
the Buyers may, at any time during the ten (10) Business Days following
their receipt of any such Seller Disclosure Letter Update, elect to terminate
this Agreement provided the Sellers have not cured or remedied such Portfolio
Material Adverse Effect (provided such Portfolio Material Adverse Effect is
reasonably capable of being cured or remedied) by the earlier of (a) the
Expiration Date and (b) forty (45) days of receipt of Buyers notice of
termination. If the Sellers so cure the matters or if the Buyers do not so
timely elect (subject to the preceding sentence with respect to the
cumulative effect of matters identified in all Seller Disclosure Letter
Updates, whether prior to or after the Schedule Update in question), the
Seller Disclosure Letter Update shall be deemed to have amended the Seller
Disclosure Letter Update as of the date of this Agreement, to have qualified
the representations and warranties contained in _Articles III_ and _IV_ as of
the date of this Agreement, and to have cured any misrepresentation or breach
of warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of the
existence of such matter, subject to the succeeding sentence. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Buyers do not terminate this Agreement, the Buyers shall
be entitled to indemnification for any Losses subject to and in accordance
with _Article VIII_ and the limitations and thresholds contained in _Section
8.4_ in an aggregate amount not to exceed $10,000,000 to the extent
attributable to any representation or warranty made by the Sellers that
becomes inaccurate for reasons not attributable to the actions of the Sellers
or their Affiliates after the Effective Date; _provided_ , that the Buyer
shall not be entitled to any indemnification pursuant to this sentence with
respect to any matters approved by or consented to by the Buyers pursuant to
this _Article VI_ ; provided further, that if the indemnification amount under
this _Section 6.15_ is in excess of $10,000,000, then prior to the Initial
Closing Date the Buyers may, at any time during the ten (10) Business Days
following their receipt of any such Seller Disclosure Letter Update, elect to
terminate this Agreement provided the Sellers have not cured or remedied such
Portfolio Material Adverse Effect (provided such Portfolio Material Adverse
Effect is reasonably capable of being cured or remedied) by the earlier of (a)
the Expiration Date and (b) forty-five (45) days of receipt of the Buyers
notice of termination. For the avoidance of doubt, any liability of the
Sellers under this _Section 6.15_ shall be included in the determination of
the cap on liability in  _Section 8.4(b)_.

6.16 _Full Production of Shaffer Project_. The Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to terminate any agreement limiting electrical production
of the Shaffer Project to less than 4999 kW (ac) such that the Project is
irrevocably authorized to operate at its full capacity without restriction
under the Interconnection Service Agreement dated August 13, 2012 (as
amended) by not later than April 1, 2015.

6.17 _Franklin Lease Amendments_. During the Interim Period, the Sellers
shall use good faith efforts to obtain lease amendments for each of the
Franklin-1 and Franklin-2 Projects that extend the 20-year term of each such
lease for two (2), five (5) year extensions.

 



54 6.18 _EPC Warranty Claims_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Date, the Sellers shall initiate the warranty claims described on _Exhibit I_
with the appropriate contractors or suppliers, and thereafter during the
applicable Interim Period shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such claims to be fully rectified prior to the Closing at which the
Transferred Company owning the affected Project is purchased by the Buyers.

6.19 _Insurance Policies_. During the Interim Period, the Buyers shall use
its best efforts to procure the Buyer Insurance Policy. If the Buyers procure
the Buyer Insurance Policy, until the expiration of Survival Period the Buyers
shall thereafter maintain such Buyer Insurance Policy in full force and
effect and not amend or permit the Buyer Insurance Policy to be canceled or
terminated; provided, that if the Buyer Insurance Policy is canceled or
terminated for reasons not attributable to the Buyers, the Buyers shall not
be deemed to have breached the foregoing covenant, but, if the Sellers
request, the Buyers thereafter shall use their best efforts to reinstate or
replace the Buyer Insurance Policy with another policy having
endorsements, retention/deductible requirements and coverage limits no less
favorable to the Buyers than those set forth on _Exhibit G_ hereto, issued by
an Acceptable Insurance Company, so long as the Buyers pay the premium
therefor as provided in the next succeeding sentence, disregarding the
limitation thereon set forth in _Exhibit G_. The Sellers shall pay the premium
(including brokers commissions, due diligence fee and taxes) and retention
for the Buyer Insurance Policy during the Survival Period, not to exceed the
amount set forth on _Exhibit G_. The Sellers shall pay the premium (including
any commission fee and related taxes) and underwriting fee for the
Environmental Insurance, not to exceed $50,000, and the Buyers shall pay any
amount in excess thereof, provided that the Buyers shall pay the premium
(including any commission fee and related taxes) and underwriting fee for the
Environmental Insurance for the Shaffer Project. In addition, the Sellers
shall provide such cooperation and support as the Buyers may reasonably
request such that the Buyers may procure the Buyer Insurance Policy and
Environmental Insurance, including (i) allowing the Buyers and potential
insurers and their respective representatives to have access upon reasonable
notice to any Project and Project site for the purpose of conducting
noninvasive inspections thereof, (ii) providing copies of environmental

reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (iii) if the Indemnified

remitted, all Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice except to the
extent otherwise required by Law. Not later than thirty (30) days prior to the
due date for filing of each such Tax Return, the Buyers shall provide the
Sellers with a draft copy of such Tax Return for review and comment, and the
Buyers shall consider in good faith inclusion in the Tax Return filed any
reasonable comments provided by the Sellers with respect to any such draft
copy not later than five (5) days prior to such due date.

(e) The Buyers shall not amend, refile or otherwise modify, or cause or
permit to be amended, refiled or otherwise modified, any Tax Return filed by
any of the Transferred Companies for any taxable year or period beginning on
or before the applicable Closing Date.

 

(f) With respect to Holdings 5 and its Subsidiaries, the Tax Returns required
to be prepared by the Buyers or any of their Affiliates in respect of the
Straddle Period pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall be prepared by
CohnReznick in consultation with and subject to the approval of KPMG. The
Buyers shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to file returns for
a Subsidiary in a manner that would not cause a "Tax Credit Adjustment
(downward)" as such term is used in Section 5.01(d)(i) of the CD US Solar MT
2, LLC Operating Agreement and Section 5.01(d)(i) of the CD US Solar MT 3,
LLC Operating Agreement.

9.3 _Straddle Period Tax Liabilities_.

 

(a) Upon the written request of the Buyers setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount owed, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyers, no later
than three (3) days prior to the due date for the applicable Tax Return, the
Taxes for which the Sellers are liable pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ but which
are payable with any Tax Return to be filed by the Buyers pursuant to 
_Section 9.2(c)_.

(b) Upon the written request of the Buyers setting forth in detail the
computation of the amount owed, the Sellers shall pay to the Buyers, no later
than three (3) days prior to the due date for the applicable Tax Return, the
Sellers Allocable Share of the Taxes for which the Sellers are liable
pursuant to _Section 9.3(c)_ but which are payable with any Tax Return to be
filed by the Buyers pursuant to _Section 9.2(d)_.

(c) Where it is necessary for purposes of this Agreement to apportion between
the Sellers and the Buyers the Taxes of or with respect to each Holdco or each
AIV and its Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period, such liability shall be
apportioned between the period deemed to end at the close of the applicable
Closing Date and the period deemed to begin at the beginning of the day
following the applicable Closing Date on the basis of an interim closing of
the books, except that Taxes (such as real or personal property Taxes) imposed
on a periodic basis shall be allocated on a daily basis.

9.4 _Assistance and Cooperation_. After the applicable Closing Date, (i) the
Buyers shall (and shall cause their Affiliates to) assist the Sellers in
preparing any Tax Returns

 



65  that the Sellers are responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
_Section 9.1_, (ii) the Sellers shall (and shall cause its Affiliates to)
assist the Buyers in preparing any Tax Returns that the Buyers are
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section 9.1_, and
(iii) the Buyers and the Sellers shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to) reasonably cooperate in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with any Governmental Body regarding, any Tax Returns by or with
respect to the Transferred Companies, including making available to each other
all records necessary in connect therewith.

 

9.5 _Audits_. The Buyers shall notify the Sellers regarding, and within ten
(10) days after, the receipt by the Buyers or any of their Affiliates
(including each Holdco and each AIV and its Subsidiaries) of notice of any
inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with respect to Taxes
of or with respect to each Holdco or each AIV and its Subsidiaries to
the extent relating to any taxable year or period (or portion thereof) ending
on or before the applicable Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Period_ ").
Provided that the Buyers shall have determined in good faith that the
total potential indemnification amount in respect of a Pre-Closing Period
will not exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate (increased by any additional
amount that the Sellers shall have placed in escrow to secure the potential
indemnification), the Sellers can elect to control the contest with respect
to each Holdco, each AIV and, to the extent within the power of the Sellers,
the Buyers or any of their Affiliates using commercially reasonable efforts,
each AIVs Subsidiaries (the " _Pre-Closing Period Contest_ "), provided that
the Sellers shall take no action to settle, compromise, prejudice or otherwise
dispose of such Pre-Closing Period Contest without the consent of the Buyers,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In all other
circumstances, the Buyers shall control any Pre-Closing Period Contest,
provided that the Buyers shall take no action to settle, compromise, prejudice
or otherwise dispose of such Pre-Closing Period Contest without the consent
of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
The Party controlling a Pre-Closing Period Contest shall keep the non-
controlling party reasonably apprised of developments in the contest
and shall provide the non-controlling party the opportunity to attend
meetings and to review and comment on submissions to be provided in connection
with the contest in advance of their submission, provided that all decisions
regarding the Pre-Closing Period Contest shall be made in the good faith
discretion of the party controlling the contest. In addition, and in any case
of an audit of Holdings 5 and its Subsidiaries with respect to investment tax
credit claimed by CD US Solar MT 3, LLC (a " _Holdings 5 ITC Audit_ "), the
Buyers shall keep the Sellers reasonably apprised of developments in the
contest and shall provide the Sellers the opportunity to attend meetings and
to review and comment on submissions to be provided in connection with the
contest in advance of their submission; provided, that all decisions regarding
the Holdings 5 ITC Audit shall be made in the good faith discretion of the
Buyers; and provided, further, that any settlement by the Buyers shall be
subject to the prior written approval of the Buyers, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that the Buyers may enter into a
settlement in their absolute discretion if the Buyers waive their right
to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to the subject of the
settlement.

9.6 _Carrybacks_. Following the applicable Closing Date, the Buyers shall,
and shall cause each Holdco and, to the extent within the power of the Buyers
or any of their Affiliates using commercially reasonable efforts, each AIV and
its Subsidiaries to, waive the right to carryback to any taxable year or
period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the applicable Closing Date
any income tax losses, credits or similar items attributable to each Holdco or
each AIV and its Subsidiaries.

 



66 9.7 _Certain Actions_. The Buyers shall not amend any Tax Return filed or
required to be filed by each Holdco or each AIV or, to the extent within the
power of the Buyers or any of their Affiliates, its Subsidiaries for a taxable
year or period beginning on or before the applicable Closing Date if such
action would (i) increase the Sellers or any of their Affiliates liability
for Taxes or (ii) result in, or change the character of, any income or gain
that must be reported on any Tax Return filed or to be filed by the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates.

 

9.8 _Tax Refunds_.

(a) Upon receipt, the Buyers shall promptly forward to the Sellers any
refund, rebate, abatement, reduction or other recovery (whether direct or
indirect through a right of set-off or credit) of Taxes of or with respect to
each Holdco, and any interest received thereon, with respect to any taxable
year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the applicable Closing
Date.

(b) Upon receipt, the Buyers shall promptly forward to the Sellers, the
Sellers Allocable Share (at the time of such receipt) of any refund, rebate,
abatement, reduction or other recovery (whether direct or indirect through a
right of set-off or credit) of Taxes of or with respect to each AIV or its
Subsidiaries, and any interest received thereon, with respect to any taxable
year or period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the applicable Closing
Date.

 

ARTICLE X

_TERMINATION_  

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Initial Closing only as follows:

 

(a) By mutual written agreement of the Sellers and the Buyers;

 

(b) By the Buyers or the Sellers by written notice to the other Party if the
Initial Closing shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2015; provided
further that such date will be extended to account for any cure period
afforded to the Buyers pursuant to _Section 101.1(d)_ or to the Sellers
pursuant to _Section 10.1(e)_ (such date, as extended, the " _Expiration
Date_ "), and (ii) termination under this _Section 10.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a Party if the Initial Closing has not occurred solely by reason
of any material breach by such Party of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;

(c) By the Buyers upon written notice to the Sellers as provided in _Section
6.15_;

(d) By the Sellers upon written notice to the Buyers if the Buyers shall have
breached in any material respect any of their representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants contained in this Agreement, but (except in the case
of a failure by the Buyers to pay the Preliminary Purchase Price when due)
only if (i) the Sellers have first given written notice to

 



67  the Buyers identifying such breach, and (ii) the Buyers have not cured or
remedied such breach (including, where payment of compensation would
reasonably be considered an adequate remedy, the payment of such adequate
compensation) within forty-five (45) days of receipt of such notice; or

(e) By the Buyers upon written notice to the Sellers if the Sellers shall
have breached in any material respect any of their representations,
warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided that
solely for purposes of this  _Section 10.1(e)_ a representation, warranty,
agreement or covenant (or the applicable portion thereof) that is qualified by
reference to a "Transferred Company Material Adverse Effect" shall be
disregarded except for purposes of determining whether the breach thereof,
collectively with all breaches of other representations, warranties,
agreements or covenants, has a Portfolio Material Adverse Effect, but only if
(i) the Buyers shall have first given written notice to the Sellers
identifying such breach, and (ii) the Sellers have not cured or remedied such
breach (including, where payment of compensation would reasonably be
considered an adequate remedy, the payment of such adequate compensation)
within forty-five (45) days of receipt of such notice.

10.2 _Effect of Termination._ In the event of a termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section 10.1_, this Agreement shall cease to have
force and effect, and there shall be no further liability or obligation on the
part of the Sellers or the Buyers (or any of their respective Representatives
or affiliates), except that (a) the provisions of _Articles VII, VIII, X_
and _XI_ shall continue to apply following any such termination, and (b) each
Party shall continue to be liable for any willful breach by such Party of
its representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained in this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination.

ARTICLE XI

 

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

11.1  _Dispute Resolution; Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process;
Waiver of Jury Trial_.

(a) Except for claims for specific performance, injunction or any preliminary
equitable relief, with respect to any claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby by or against any Party (a " _Dispute_ "), the Parties
shall promptly seek to resolve any such Dispute through negotiations between
senior officers or other authorized representatives of the Buyers and Sellers,
or their respective Affiliates, in each case, with authority to settle such
Dispute. Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a written notice of a
Dispute, the non-claiming Party shall submit to the claiming Party a written
response. Both the notice and response shall include (i) a statement of the
Partys position and a summary of the evidence and arguments supporting such
position; and (ii) the name, title, and telephone number of the senior officer
or authorized representative who shall represent the Party in such
negotiations. In the event that the Dispute involves a claim arising out of
the actions of any Person not a signatory to this Agreement, the receiving
Party shall have such additional time as necessary, not to exceed an
additional fifteen (15) days, to investigate the Dispute before submitting a
written response. The senior officers or other authorized representatives
shall meet at a mutually agreed time within

 



68  seven (7) days after the date such response is delivered and thereafter as
often as they deem reasonably necessary to exchange relevant information and
attempt to resolve the Dispute. Such meetings may be conducted in-person (at
a mutually agreed place) or via telephonic conference

Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby by or
against any Party (or its Affiliates or designees) shall be instituted
exclusively in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or the courts of the State of New York, in the City of New York, and
each Party (for itself, its Affiliates and its designees) waives any right it
may have to assert, by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such
claim, that it is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that the claim is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
claim is improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter hereof may not
be enforced in or by such court. Each Party (for itself, its Affiliates and
its designees) further irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such court in any such claim, and the appellate courts therefrom.

 

(c) Any and all service of process and any other notice in any such claim
shall be effective against any party if given personally or by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other means of mail that
requires a signed receipt, postage prepaid, mailed to such party as herein
provided.

 

(d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY.

power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
waiver on the part of any party of any such right, power or privilege, nor any
single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege, preclude any
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power or
privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided in this
Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and
privileges provided by applicable Law.

 

11.5 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
