pursuant to Section 2.2 below all of AUO's shares in AUOSP whenever acquired
("the AUO Shares"). On the date hereof, the Parties have delivered to each

shareholders approving the sale or purchase of the AUO Shares and the other
transactions contemplated herein and by the Settlement Agreement as
applicable. On or before the Closing Date, AUO shall take all other actions
and deliver all documents necessary to convey to SPTL all of AUO's right, title and interest in and to all of the AUO Shares, including
without limitation (a) a Form 32A (Share Transfer Form) duly executed by AUO
in favor of SPTL, and (b) the original share certificates in the name of AUO
representing the AUO Shares, together with any other evidence of ownership (in
each case properly endorsed for transfer to SPTL) sufficient to deliver the
AUO Shares to SPTL free and clear of any and all liens, security interests,
adverse claims, restrictions and other encumbrances other than those set forth
in Schedule 2.1.

2.2 Purchase Price for the AUO Shares. For the AUO Shares, SPTL shall pay to

2.3 Payment of the Purchase Price. SPTL's payment of the Purchase Price shall
(subject to the balance of this section) be according to the following
installment schedule (the "Purchase Price Installment Payment Schedule"): 

---

$170,100,000 

 

SPTL shall pay the installment due on the Closing Date by wire transfer, and
receipt by AUO of said installment payment of $109,000,000 is a required
condition of Closing subject to the terms herein including Section 2.5. The
remaining installments of the Purchase Price shall be paid on or before the
applicable anniversary of the Closing Date (each, a "Closing Date
Anniversary") according to the Purchase Price Payment Schedule set forth above
(or, if any such Closing Date Anniversary falls on a day that is not a
business day, on the next succeeding business day).

SPTL shall not pay, and AUO shall not be entitled to, any interest on any
amount of the Purchase Price, including interest on any amounts that remain
unpaid at any time (i.e., SPTL shall not owe or pay any interest on any
installment payment in advance of the date on which that installment is due to
be paid), except that SPTL shall be liable for interest at an annual interest
rate of eight percent (8%) compounded monthly, on any overdue payment
remaining overdue for more than thirty (30) business days after the scheduled
due date, commencing on the date the payment becomes due and all or any
portion of the payment has not been paid. SPTL shall have the right at its
sole discretion to prepay the full amount of the Purchase Price remaining
unpaid at any time in advance of the due date for payment, without penalty. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing or elsewhere in this Purchase
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that (i) any bank or financial
institution accelerates any outstanding loan, debt or financial obligation in
excess of an aggregate amount of $50,000,000 of SP. Corp.; (ii) SP Corp. files
for bankruptcy or commences an insolvency proceeding, or a bankruptcy action
or insolvency proceeding is filed or commenced against SP Corp and not stayed
or dismissed within ninety (90) days; or (iii) SPTL misses a post-Closing Date
installment payment under the schedule above and SP Corp. does not make the
payment pursuant to the terms of the Guaranty, then any and all remaining
payments due to AUO hereunder shall become immediately due and payable and
begin to accrue interest on the total amount such owed, at an annual interest
rate of eight percent (8%) compounded monthly. SPTL shall provide AUO written
notice, via personal delivery and electronic mail both, within two (2)
business days of any such occurrence specified in clauses (i) through (iii)
above (and, for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of a bankruptcy action or
insolvency proceeding against SP. Corp., within two (2) business days of the
initiation of any such proceeding). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the foregoing, a written waiver of any acceleration referred to in clause
(i) of this paragraph by the person or entity to whom such loan, debt or
financial obligation is owed shall be deemed a waiver of any acceleration
hereunder resulting pursuant to clause (i) of this paragraph. SP. Corp. shall
promptly provide a copy of such waiver.

2.4 SP Corp. Guaranty. SPTL's obligations hereunder to make all payments
required by SPTL under this Purchase Agreement and to ultimately pay the
Purchase Price in full shall be guaranteed by SP Corp. pursuant to the
Guaranty in the form attached as Exhibit A dated as of the date hereof (the
"Guaranty").

2.5 Certain Taxes. Except as elsewhere provided, each Party (and the JVC to
the extent permitted under law) is responsible for the determination and
payment of any applicable Taxes payable by that Party in connection with the
purchase and sale of the AUO Shares. Either Party may withhold any amounts to
pay Taxes if required to do so by applicable law. If SPTL is required to make
any withholding from the Purchase Price, (a) before making any such
withholding, SPTL shall give AUO notice of the intention to make such
withholding(such notice, which shall include the authority, basis and method
of calculation for the proposed withholding, shall be given at least a
commercially reasonable period of time before such withholding is required, in
order for AUO to obtain reduction of or relief from such withholding), (b)
SPTL shall cooperate with AUO to the extent reasonable in efforts to obtain
reduction of or relief from such withholding, (c) AUO shall work with SPTL to
provide information within its possession that is reasonably necessary to
calculate and determine the withholding, and (d) SPTL shall timely remit to
the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all amounts so withheld and
timely file all Tax returns and to the extent required provide to AUO such
information statements and other documents required to be filed or provided
under applicable Tax law.

2.6 Closing Date. The closing of the purchase and sale contemplated hereby
(the Closing") shall occur at the offices of Jones Day at 8th Floor, 2 Tun Hwa
South Road, Section 2, Taipei, 106 Taiwan on the later of (a) September 23,
2016 (Taiwan time) or (b) two business days after the last of the conditions
to the Closing set forth in Section 2.8 have been satisfied or waived (the
"Closing Date"), in each case unless otherwise agreed in writing by the
Parties. In the event reasonably necessary, the Closing Date may be extended
to accommodate the process contemplated in Section 2.5 relating to withholding, but not beyond the Outside Date unless
mutually agreed. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that AUO shall convey to SPTL all the AUO Shares at the Closing on the Closing
Date even though not all of the Purchase Price will have been paid by SPTL on
the Closing Date, provided that (i) SPTL has paid to AUO and AUO has received
the installment of the Purchase Price due on the Closing Date as provided
herein; and (ii) SPTL is otherwise in compliance with its obligations under
this Purchase Agreement, the Settlement Agreement, the Guaranty, and the
Supply Agreement. On the Closing Date, and subject to these conditions, SPTL
shall take full ownership and control of AUOSP and the AUO Shares, and the AUO
Parties shall retain no interest or rights in the JVC of any type or
description. SPTL and AUO agree to exercise their respective best efforts to
cause all Closing conditions within their power to be satisfied by the Outside
Date (as defined below).

2.7 Additional Deliveries on the Closing Date by AUO and SPTL.

AGREEMENT



NOW, THEREFORE, for valuable consideration and as an inducement to
Beneficiaries and their affiliates, as relevant, to enter into the Settlement
Agreement, Supply Agreement and Purchase Agreement, Guarantor covenants to the
Beneficiaries as follows:

1.Guarantee of Obligations. Guarantor hereby irrevocably, absolutely and
unconditionally guarantees to each Beneficiary, its successors and permitted
assigns, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, the full and timely
performance when due, (i) all installment payments of the Purchase Price as
defined in the Purchase Agreement required to be made by Guarantor Subsidiary
1 under the Purchase Agreement, as such payment obligations may be amended,
modified or supplemented in accordance with the terms of the Purchase
Agreement, by mutual agreement of the Guarantor Subsidiary 1 and AUO
Singapore, (ii) the performance of all obligations of Guarantor Subsidiary 2
under the Supply Agreement, as such obligations may be amended, modified or
supplemented in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement, by mutual
agreement of the Guarantor Subsidiary 2 and AUO Taiwan, and (iii) all
obligations, including payment of any costs and expenses required hereunder,
of Guarantor under this Guaranty, or otherwise in accordance with law (such
obligations under clauses (i) through (iii) above, collectively the
"Guaranteed Obligations"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Guaranteed
Obligations include all amounts that would become due under the Purchase
Agreement or Supply Agreement, as relevant, notwithstanding the operation of
an automatic stay under section 362(a) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code of 1978 or
any successor provision (the "U.S. Bankruptcy Code"). Notwithstanding anything
in this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall not modify the
Guaranteed Obligations under the Purchase Agreement or Supply Agreement, as
applicable. This Guaranty is a continuing guarantee, and shall apply to all
Guaranteed Obligations whenever arising under the Purchase Agreement or Supply
Agreement, as applicable, and shall remain in full force and effect for so
long as they remain in effect under the Purchase Agreement or Supply
Agreement, as applicable. Upon the occurrence of a Guaranty Default (as
defined below), Guarantor shall, upon demand by the Beneficiary, pay or
perform (or procure the payment or performance of) the Guaranteed Obligations
in the respective Guarantor Subsidiary's stead as if the Guarantor instead of
the Guarantor Subsidiary were expressed to be the principal obligor of such
Guaranteed Obligations. "Guaranty Default" means the occurrence of (a) the
failure of Guarantor Subsidiary 1 to timely make any installment payments of
the Purchase Price required to be made by Guarantor Subsidiary 1 under the
Purchase Agreement; (b) any bank or financial institution accelerating any
outstanding loan, debt or financial obligation in excess of an aggregate
amount of $50,000,000 of SP Corp.; (c) SP Corp. filing for bankruptcy or
commencing an insolvency proceeding, or a bankruptcy action or insolvency
proceeding being filed or commenced against SP Corp. and not stayed or
dismissed within ninety (90) days; or (d) pursuant to the Supply Agreement,
the failure of Guarantor Subsidiary 2 to perform any of its obligations under
the Supply Agreement. Guarantor shall provide Beneficiaries written notice,
via personal delivery and electronic mail both, within two (2) business days
of the occurrence of any Guaranty Default (and, for the avoidance of doubt, in
the case of a bankruptcy action or insolvency proceeding against SP Corp.,
within two (2) business days of the initiation of any such proceeding). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, a
written waiver of any acceleration referred to in clause (b) of this paragraph
by the person or entity to whom such loan, debt or financial obligation is
owed shall be deemed a waiver of any acceleration hereunder resulting pursuant
to clause (b) of this paragraph. SP. Corp. shall promptly provide a copy of
such waiver.

2. Nature of Guarantor's Guaranteed Obligations under Supply Agreement. It is expressly understood and agreed by Guarantor that, to the extent Guarantor's obligations hereunder relate to Guaranteed Obligations which require performance other than the payment of money, the Beneficiaries may proceed against Guarantor to effect specific performance thereof (to the extent such relief would be available to the Beneficiaries under the Supply Agreement) or for payment of damages (as limited by the Supply Agreement) resulting from the Guarantor Subsidiary 2's nonperformance. For purposes of this Guaranty, procuring the performance shall be deemed to satisfy a requirement of specific performance. In the event the Guarantor Subsidiary 2 is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding under applicable law, and the Supply Agreement is disaffirmed by the trustee in bankruptcy for the Guarantor Subsidiary 2, upon the Beneficiaries' election, Guarantor shall, make and enter into a new contract performing or causing to be performed the balance of the Guaranteed Obligations pursuant to the Supply Agreement, which said new agreement shall be in form and substance substantially identical to the Supply Agreement.

3. Payments. All payments required to be made by Guarantor to each Beneficiary under this Guaranty shall be made in United States dollars and shall be paid within thirty (30) business days after receipt by Guarantor from the respective Beneficiary of written demand for such payment and shall not be the subject of any offset against any amounts which may be owed by the Beneficiaries to Guarantor for any reason. Each and every default or failure by the Guarantor Subsidiary in making a payment or otherwise discharging or performing any of the Guaranteed Obligations shall give rise to a separate liability of such Guarantor Subsidiary to the relevant Beneficiary and a separate cause of action hereunder and a separate suit may be brought hereunder as each liability or cause of action arises.

4. Costs, Expenses, Fees. Guarantor agrees to pay all costs, expenses and fees, including all reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be incurred by the Beneficiaries in enforcing this Guaranty, whether by suit or otherwise, to the extent the Beneficiaries are the prevailing party. The costs, expenses and fees required to be paid under the immediately preceding sentence include any increased tax obligations borne directly by the Beneficiaries in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations equal to the excess over any amounts for which the Beneficiaries would have been liable had the Guarantor Subsidiaries performed or made payment under the Guaranteed Obligations directly and without any demand under this Guaranty.

5. Waiver of Defenses. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional. The obligations of Guarantor shall not be affected, modified, impaired or prejudiced (i) by any security now or hereafter held by the Beneficiary as security for the obligations of the Guarantor Subsidiary; or (ii) by the happening from time to time of any one or more of the following whether or not with notice to or consent of the Guarantor Subsidiary or Guarantor: (a) the compromise, composition, settlement, release, change, modification, or
termination of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or any time, forbearance,
extension or waiver granted to the Guarantor Subsidiary or any other person,
provided that Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty shall be in respect
of the Guaranteed Obligations in effect after giving effect to any such
compromise, composition, settlement, release, change, modification or
termination;

(b) the waiver by the Beneficiary of the payment, performance or observance of
any of the Guaranteed Obligations, provided that Guarantor's obligations under
this Guaranty shall be in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations in effect
after giving effect to any such waiver;

(c) the extension of time for payment of any amounts due or of the time for
performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations, provided that Guarantor's
obligations under this Guaranty shall be in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations in effect after giving effect to any such extension;

(d) the modification or amendment (whether material or otherwise) of any of
the Guaranteed Obligations, provided that Guarantor's obligations under this
Guaranty shall be in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations in effect after
giving effect to any such modification or amendment, or restatement,
replacement or novation of the Purchase Agreement or Supply Agreement or any
other document, Guaranty or security so that references to the Purchase
Agreement and Supply Agreement, as applicable, shall include each amendment,
variation, restatement, replacement and novation;

(e) the failure, omission, delay or lack on the part of the Beneficiary to
enforce, ascertain or exercise any right, power or remedy under or pursuant to
the terms of the Supply Agreement, the Purchase Agreement or this Guaranty;

(f) the fact that Guarantor may at any time in the future dispose of all or
any part of its interest in a Guarantor Subsidiary, or otherwise alter its
investment in Guarantor Subsidiary in any manner, unless (i) the Guaranty is
expressly assumed by a successor to the Guarantor and (ii) such successor's
financial resources are, in the Beneficiary' reasonable judgment, sufficient
to enable the successor to satisfy Guarantor's obligations under this
Guaranty, it being understood that if the successor's financial resources are
at least as great as Guarantor's as of the date hereof, then such resources
will be deemed to be sufficient;

(g) the avoidance, postponement, discharge, reduction, non-provability or
other similar circumstance affecting any Guaranteed Obligation resulting from
the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, winding up, dissolution,
liquidation, administrations, reorganization or other similar or dissimilar
failure or financial disability of Guarantor Subsidiary or Guarantor or any
legal limitation, disability, incapacity, or any law, regulation or order, or
other circumstances relating to the Guarantor Subsidiary or Guarantor;

(h) if at any time there is any additional guarantor, maker or other party
(excluding each Guarantor Subsidiary) primarily or secondarily liable or
responsible for the performance and observance of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations, the addition, substitution or partial or entire release of any
such party, or any extension, waiver, amendment or thing whatsoever which may release or discharge (in whole or part) any such party (other than
as a result of the payment and performance of the Guaranteed Obligations in
full);

(i) the invalidity, illegality, nonbinding effect or unenforceability of (x)
the Guaranteed Obligations or (y) the Purchase Agreement, the Settlement
Agreement and the Supply Agreement, each in its entirety, to the intent that
the Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty shall remain in full force and
be construed accordingly, as if there were no invalidity, illegality,
nonbinding effect or unenforceability, except to the extent that a final,
binding determination of such invalidity, illegality, nonbinding effect or
unenforceability has been made by an arbitration panel or court of competent
jurisdiction or a determination by such a court sitting in equity that
Guarantor has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits that the
obligation sought to be enforced by the Beneficiary is invalid, illegal,
nonbinding or unenforceable;

(j) the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal, addition,
substitution, subordination, non-perfection or partial or entire release of
any security for the Guaranteed Obligations or the enforcement or refusal or
neglect to perfect or enforce any such security, or the non-presentation or
non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any
instrument or any failure to realize the full value of any security;

(k) any sale, lease or transfer of the assets or change in the ownership of
any shares in the capital of the Guarantor; or

(l) any disability, incapacity or lack of powers, authority or legal
personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of the
Guarantor Subsidiary or any other person.

6. Waiver of Subrogation. Guarantor irrevocably and absolutely waives any and all right of subrogation, contribution, indemnification, reimbursement or similar rights against Guarantor Subsidiary with respect to the Guaranty, whether such rights arise under an express or implied contract or by operation of law, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid or performed in full or this Guaranty shall otherwise no longer be in force or effect. Accordingly, Guarantor shall not be deemed to be a "creditor" (as defined in section 101 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law) of Guarantor Subsidiary by reason of the existence of this Guaranty in the event that Guarantor Subsidiary becomes a debtor in any proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable law, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid or performed in full or this Guaranty shall otherwise no longer be in force or effect. In addition, Guarantor will not exercise any rights which it may acquire by way of subrogation under this Guaranty by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have indefeasibly been paid or performed in full or this Guaranty shall otherwise no longer be in force or effect. If any amount shall be paid to Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights at any time when all Guaranteed Obligations related to payment shall not have been indefeasibly paid in full or this Guaranty shall otherwise no longer be in force or effect, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Beneficiaries and shall forthwith be paid to the Beneficiaries and applied to such Guaranteed Obligations.

7. Election of Remedies. The Beneficiary shall have the right, in its sole judgment and discretion, from time to time, to make demand for payment or performance and to proceed against Guarantor for recovery of the total of any and all amounts due to the
Beneficiary pursuant to this Guaranty, or to proceed from time to time against
Guarantor for such portion of any and all such amounts, or for the performance
of any and all such nonmonetary obligations, as the Beneficiary may determine.

8. Bankruptcy Proceedings. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not be altered, limited or affected by any proceeding, voluntary or involuntary, involving the winding up, dissolution, administration, bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, receivership, liquidation or arrangement or similar proceeding of either Guarantor Subsidiary, or by any defense which either Guarantor Subsidiary may have by reason of any order, decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such proceeding.

9. Waivers. With respect to all Guaranteed Obligations, this is a guarantee of payment and performance and not of collection, and Guarantor hereby waives and relinquishes the rights and remedies accorded by applicable law to sureties or guarantors (but not remedies accorded to primary obligors), and agrees not to assert or take advantage of any such rights or remedies, to the extent set forth in this Section 9:

(a) any right to require the Beneficiary to proceed against Guarantor
Subsidiary or any other person or to proceed against or exhaust any security
held by the Beneficiary at any time or to pursue any other remedy in the
Beneficiary's power before proceeding against Guarantor;

(b) any defense based upon any right of setoff, counterclaim or other right,
defense, or claim based on, or in the nature of, any obligation now or later
owed to the Guarantor by the Guarantor Subsidiary or any other person;

(c) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity, lack of authority,
death or disability of any other person, or in the event Guarantor Subsidiary
is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding under applicable law, the failure of
the Beneficiary to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in
administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding arising from or addressing
the insolvency of Guarantor Subsidiary);

(d) promptness, diligence, demand, presentment, protest and notice of any
kind, including without limitation notice of the existence, creation or
incurring of any new or additional Guaranteed Obligations or of any action or
non-action on the part of Guarantor Subsidiary, the Beneficiary, any creditor
of Guarantor Subsidiary or Guarantor or on the part of any other person under
this or any other instrument in connection with any obligation or evidence of
indebtedness held by the Beneficiary as collateral or in connection with any
Guaranteed Obligations hereby guaranteed;

(e) any duty on the part of the Beneficiary to disclose to Guarantor any facts
the Beneficiary may now or hereafter know about Guarantor Subsidiary,
regardless of whether the Beneficiary has reason to believe that any such
facts materially increase the risk beyond that which Guarantor intends to
assume, or has reason to believe that such facts are unknown to Guarantor, or
has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to Guarantor, since
Guarantor acknowledges that Guarantor is fully responsible for being and
keeping informed of the financial condition of Guarantor Subsidiary and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-
payment of any Guaranteed Obligations hereby guaranteed; and

(f) any defense arising because of the exercise of any right or remedy
available to, or election made by, the Beneficiary pursuant to the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, whether as an unsecured or undersecured creditor, seeking
adequate protection, or otherwise.

10. No Marshaling. Except to the extent required by applicable law, the Beneficiary will not be required to marshal any collateral securing, or any other guaranties of, the Guaranteed Obligations, or to resort to any item of collateral or any other guarantee in any particular order, and the Beneficiary's rights with respect to any collateral and guaranties will be cumulative and in addition to all other rights, however existing or arising. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Guarantor irrevocably waives, and agrees that it will not invoke or assert, any law requiring or relating to the marshaling of collateral or guaranties or any other law which might cause a delay in or impede the enforcement of the Beneficiary's rights under this Guaranty or any other agreement.

11. Successors and Assigns. This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns, provided, however, that except as set forth in Section 17, Guarantor may not make an assignment or other transfer of this Guaranty or any interest herein by operation of law or otherwise unless it has obtained the prior written consent of the Beneficiary to such assignment or other transfer.

12. Tolling. Guarantor agrees that payment or performance of any of the Guaranteed Obligations or other acts which toll any statute of limitations applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations, the Supply Agreement or the Purchase Agreement shall also toll the statute of limitations applicable to Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty.

13. Representations and Warranties. Guarantor represents and warrants to and with the Beneficiary that:

(a) Guarantor is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, authorized to
do business and in good standing under the laws of Delaware;

enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the
application of bankruptcy and similar laws and of general equitable
principles; (e) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty do not violate

consent, authorization or approval of, or any notice to or filing with, any

and its respective properties; and

(g) the execution, delivery, and performance of this Guaranty does not and

documents of Guarantor, or (ii) constitute an event which would permit any
person or entity to terminate rights or accelerate the performance or maturity
of any indebtedness or obligation of Guarantor, the effect of which would
materially affect Guarantor's ability to meet its obligations under this
Guaranty, or (iii) constitute an event which would require any consent of a
third party or under any agreement to which Guarantor is bound, the absence of
which consent would materially and adversely affect Guarantor's ability to
meet its obligations under this Guaranty.

14. Consents, Compliance with Laws, Delivery of Information. Guarantor agrees that:

assignment, Guarantor shall acknowledge the continuing effectiveness of this
Guaranty notwithstanding such assignment.

16. Further Assurances. The Guarantor and each Beneficiary shall cooperate and take such action as may be reasonably requested by any of the others in order to carry out the provisions and purposes of this Guaranty and the transactions contemplated hereby.

17. Assignment. The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the Beneficiary. Subject to the foregoing, this Guaranty and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Beneficiary and, except as provided in this Guaranty, its successors and assigns.

18. General. This Guaranty shall bind Guarantor and its successors and assigns, and the benefits hereof shall inure to the benefit of the Beneficiary and their successors and assigns. All reference herein to a "Guarantor" and the "Beneficiary" shall be deemed to apply to the Guarantor and the Beneficiary, respectively, and to their respective successors and assigns.

19. Entire Agreement. This Guaranty constitutes the entire agreement with respect to this Guaranty and supersedes any other agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into between the Beneficiary and Guarantor or by any office or officer of such parties relating to the subject matter hereof. No oral or written amendment or modification of this Guaranty by any officer, agent, member, manager or employee of the Beneficiary or Guarantor, either before or after execution of this Guaranty, shall be of any force or effect unless such amendment or modification is in writing and is signed by a duly authorized representative of the party to be bound thereby. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Guaranty amends, restates or modifies any provision or term of the Transaction Documents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement).

20. Amendment and Modification. This Guaranty may be amended or modified, or any provision hereof may be waived, provided that such amendment, modification or waiver is set forth in writing executed by the Guarantor and each Beneficiary. In the event of any waiver of any provision of this Guaranty, the remainder of this Guaranty shall not be affected. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Guaranty will be deemed to be or will constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise provided therein. No course of dealing or course of conduct between or among any Persons having any interest in this Guaranty will be deemed effective to modify, amend or waive any part of this Guaranty or any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Guaranty.

21. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any portion or provision of this Guaranty shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any other portion or provision hereof. Any invalid or unenforceable portion or provision shall be deemed severed from this Guaranty and the balance of this Guaranty shall be construed and enforced as if this Guaranty did not contain such invalid or unenforceable portion or provision. If any such
provision of this Guaranty is so declared invalid, the parties hereto shall
promptly negotiate in good faith new provisions to eliminate such invalidity
and to restore this Guaranty as near as possible to its original intent and
effect.

22. Notices. Except as set forth in Section 1 above, all notices, demands, requests, consents or other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given by personal delivery, by express courier, by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, or by facsimile, to the Guarantor and the Beneficiaries at the addresses shown below, or to such other address as may be designated by written notice given by the applicable Person to the others.

24. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution. This Guaranty and all disputes arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty shall be governed by, interpreted under, and construed and enforceable in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Guaranty shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with the said Rules. The place of arbitration shall be San Francisco, California. The language of the arbitration shall be English. The arbitrators shall award the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the arbitrators, its attorneys' fees and costs. Judgment upon any award(s) rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties undertake to keep confidential all awards in their arbitration, together with all materials in the proceedings created for the purpose of the arbitration and all other documents produced by another party in the proceedings not otherwise in the public domain, save and to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party by legal duty, to protect or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in legal proceedings before a court or other judicial authority. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, for the exclusive benefit of the Beneficiaries, the parties agree that the Beneficiaries shall have the exclusive right, at their option, to apply to the federal or state courts of California to settle any disputes which may arise out of this Guaranty.

25. Counterparts. This Guaranty may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

26. Remedies. If the Guarantor breaches or threatens to commit a breach of its obligations under this Guaranty, any Beneficiary injured or to be injured by such breach, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by Law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Guaranty. The Guarantor agrees that the provisions of this Guaranty shall be specifically enforceable, it being agreed that the remedy at law, including monetary damages, for breach of such provision may be inadequate compensation for any loss and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at Law would be adequate is waived. 27. No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Beneficiary to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Beneficiary of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Beneficiary or allowed it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Beneficiary at any time or from time to time. No waiver of any provision of this Guaranty, and no consent to any departure by Guarantor therefrom, shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the Beneficiary.
