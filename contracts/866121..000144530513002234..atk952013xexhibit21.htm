(v) to the Seller, an amount equal to the Estimated Purchase Price minus the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Interim Loss
Indemnity Escrow Amount (the "Closing Date Payment").

The Seller shall provide Buyer with a flow of funds (the "Funds Flow
Memorandum") accurately setting forth the amounts to be paid pursuant to this
Section 2.4(a) along with the payees thereof and the wire instructions
therefor at least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Upon the
payment of the Closing Date Payment to the Seller, the Seller shall cease to
have any right, title or interest in the Shares, except rights expressly
provided to the Seller under the terms of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Documents.

(b) Determination of the Final Purchase Price.

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a reasonably detailed proposed
calculation of each of (A) the Net Working Capital (and the related Net
Working Capital Adjustment) and (B) the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents,
and in each case, the components thereof and in a manner consistent with the
definitions thereof and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (which calculations shall collectively be referred to herein as the
"Proposed Closing Date Calculations"). If Buyer fails to timely deliver any of
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations in accordance with the foregoing, then,
at the election of the Seller in its sole discretion, either (i) the Actual
Adjustment shall be deemed to equal zero or (ii) the Seller shall retain a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm that is reasonably
acceptable to Buyer to provide an audit of the Group Companies' books, review
the calculation of the Net Working Capital (and the related Net Working
Capital Adjustment) and the amount of Cash and Cash Equivalents and make any
adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the provisions of this Section
2.4(b), the determination of such accounting firm being conclusive and binding
on the Parties absent fraud or manifest error. The engagement fees of any such
independent accounting firm shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by Buyer.

(ii) The Seller shall have 45 days following receipt of the Proposed Closing
Date Calculations to review such calculations (the "Review Period"). The
Seller may, on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, give to Buyer
written notice of dispute ("Purchase Price Dispute Notice"), which shall
specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts in Buyer's calculation of
the Proposed Closing Date Calculations as to which the Seller disagrees (the
"Disputed Items") and the basis for such disagreement. Prior to the end of the
Review Period, the Seller may accept the Proposed Closing Date Calculations by
delivering written notice to that effect to Buyer, in which case the Proposed
Closing Date Calculations (and corresponding Actual Adjustment and Purchase
Price calculated on the basis thereof) will become conclusive and binding when
such notice is given. Unless the Seller delivers a Purchase Price Dispute
Notice to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Seller will
be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations (and corresponding Actual Adjustment and Purchase Price
calculated on the basis thereof) and such amounts shall become conclusive and
binding on Buyer and the Seller. Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall
within five (5) Business Days of the date of the expiration of the Review
Period make the adjustment payment required by Section 2.4(c)

with respect to such undisputed items. If the Seller gives a Purchase Price
Dispute Notice to Buyer on or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Buyer and the Seller shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed Items set forth in the Purchase
Price Dispute Notice in good faith during the 30-day period commencing on the
date Buyer receives the applicable Purchase Price Dispute Notice from the
Seller. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Federal Rules of
Evidence Rule 408 shall apply to any discussions related to the Disputed Items
between Buyer and the Seller during such 30-day period, including any
subsequent disputes arising therefrom. If the Seller and Buyer do not agree
upon a final resolution with respect to the Disputed Items set forth in the
Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such 30-day period, then the remaining
Disputed Items shall be submitted immediately by Buyer and the Seller to an
independent accounting firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to
Buyer and the Seller (the "Accounting Firm"). The Accounting Firm shall be
requested to render a written determination of the Disputed Items (acting as
an expert and not as an arbitrator) within 45 days after referral of the
matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor and must be based
solely on the definitions and other applicable provisions of this Agreement
with respect to the Disputed Items, on a single presentation submitted by each
of Buyer and the Seller and on one written response to each such presentation
so submitted. The terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm
shall be as agreed upon between the Seller and Buyer, and any associated
engagement fees shall initially be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by Buyer;
provided that such fees shall ultimately be borne by each party in the
percentage calculated by dividing (i) the amount that the Accounting Firm
allocates, of the amounts related to the disputed items, to the other party by
(ii) the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally submitted to
the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute total in amount
to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of the Seller's
position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of
the costs would be borne by the Seller. Except as provided in the preceding
two sentences, all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in
connection with resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense. In resolving the
Disputed Items, the Accounting Firm shall limit its review to determining the
amount for each Disputed Item in accordance with the standards and definitions
in this Agreement and shall resolve each Disputed Item by choosing an amount
which is either equal to or in between the amount for each Disputed Item set
forth in the Proposed Closing Date Calculations and the amount for each
Disputed Item set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice. Such
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties absent fraud or manifest error. The Proposed Closing Date Calculations
shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any objections
thereto pursuant to this Section 2.4(b)(ii), and, as so revised, such Proposed
Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the final Net Working
Capital (and the related Net Working Capital Adjustment), Cash and Cash
Equivalents and Purchase Price resulting therefrom (which shall be equal to
the Estimated Purchase Price as adjusted solely to give effect to any
differences between Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment and Net Working
Capital Adjustment and Estimated Cash and Cash Equivalents and Cash and Cash
Equivalents (in each case fully determined in accordance with this Section
2.4)), in each case, for all purposes hereunder (including the determination
of the Actual Adjustment).

(iii) Each of Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries (including, in the case of Buyer, the Group Companies)
to, make their

|

| 



respective financial records and all supporting documents and work papers used
in preparation or review of the Proposed Closing Date Calculations (provided
that the Party (or its representatives) requesting work papers has executed
and delivered any non-reliance, release or other agreements required by the
accounting firm which has prepared such work papers) and personnel available
to the other Party and its accountants and other representatives at reasonable
times at any time during Buyer's preparation of the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations or the review by the Seller of the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations, as applicable, as well as during the resolution of any audit
pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(i) or of any Disputed Items.

(iv) Buyer and the Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this Section
2.4 for resolving disputes with respect to the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any Disputed
Items; provided that this provision shall not prohibit either Party from
instituting litigation to enforce any final determination of the Net Working
Capital and Cash and Cash Equivalents by the Accounting Firm pursuant to
Section 2.4(b)(ii) in any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with
Section 10.16. The substance of the Accounting Firm's determination shall not
be subject to review or appeal, absent a showing of fraud or manifest error.
It is the intent of the Parties to have any final determination of the Net
Working Capital and Cash and Cash Equivalents by the Accounting Firm proceed
in an expeditious manner; however, any deadline or time period contained
herein may be extended or modified by the written agreement of the Parties and
the Parties agree that the failure of the Accounting Firm to strictly conform
to any deadline or time period contained herein shall not be a basis for
seeking to overturn any determination rendered by the Accounting Firm which
otherwise conforms to the terms of this Section 2.4.

(c) Adjustment to Estimated Purchase Price.

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, (x) the Buyer shall pay to
the Seller an amount equal to such positive amount, if any, by wire transfer
or delivery of immediately available funds, in each case, within three
Business Days after the date on which the Net Working Capital Adjustment and
Cash and Cash Equivalents are determined pursuant to this Section 2.4 and (y)
Buyer and the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow
Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Funds from
the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Seller.

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within three Business
Days after the date on which the Net Working Capital Adjustment and Cash and
Cash Equivalents are determined pursuant to this Section 2.4, the Buyer and
the Seller shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to deliver to the Buyer an amount equal to the
absolute value of such negative amount out of the Adjustment Escrow Account
(and, if applicable, out of the Indemnity Escrow Account as provided for in
clause (y) of the following proviso); provided, that (x) to the extent the
absolute value of the Actual Adjustment is less than the Adjustment Escrow
Funds (the amount by which the absolute value of the Actual Adjustment is less
than the Adjustment Escrow Funds, net of any amounts that the Seller is
required to pay the Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(ii), is
referred to as the "Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount"), the Parties shall
deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the

| | 

|

21 

| 



Escrow Agent to release the Adjustment Escrow Excess Amount from the
Adjustment Escrow Account to the Seller simultaneously with the payment of the
Actual Adjustment to Buyer and (y) to the extent the absolute value of the
Actual Adjustment is more than the Adjustment Escrow Funds (the amount by
which the absolute value of the Actual Adjustment is more than the Adjustment
Escrow Funds, net of any amounts that the Seller is required to pay the
Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 2.4(b)(ii), is referred to as the
"Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount"), the Parties shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release the
Adjustment Escrow Shortfall Amount from the Indemnity Escrow Account to Buyer
simultaneously with the payment of the remainder of the Actual Adjustment to
Buyer.

(iii) The parties' payment obligations under this Section 2.4 will not be
subject to offset or reduction by reason of any actual or alleged breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement or the
Ancillary Documents and any right or alleged right of indemnification
hereunder or for any other reason or under any other agreement.

(d) Determination of the Interim Loss Estimate Amount.

(i) No later than five Business Days prior to the Closing, Buyer shall deliver
to the Seller a statement setting forth, in reasonable detail, Buyer's
reasonable, good faith estimate of the Interim Loss Estimate Amount (such
estimate, "Buyer's Interim Loss Estimate Amount").

(ii) The Seller may, prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, give to Buyer written notice of dispute ("Interim Loss
Indemnity Dispute Notice"), which shall specify in reasonable detail any items
or amounts in Buyer's Interim Loss Estimate Amount as to which the Seller
disagrees (the "Interim Loss Disputed Items") and the basis for such
disagreement. Prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Seller may accept Buyer's Interim Loss Estimate Amount by
delivering written notice to that effect to Buyer, in which case Buyer's
estimate of the Interim Loss Estimate Amount (and corresponding Interim Loss
Indemnity Escrow Amount, Interim Loss Indemnity Threshold and Indemnity
Threshold calculated on the basis thereof) will become conclusive and binding
solely for purposes of determining the Interim Loss Estimate Amount (and
related calculations) when such notice is given, and is otherwise subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 2.4(d)(iii) below. Unless the Seller
delivers a Interim Loss Indemnity Dispute Notice to Buyer prior to the date
that is three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller will be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to Buyer's estimate of the Interim Loss
Estimate Amount (and corresponding Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Amount,
Interim Loss Indemnity Threshold and Indemnity Threshold calculated on the
basis thereof) and such amounts shall become conclusive and binding on Buyer
and the Seller. If the Seller gives an Interim Loss Indemnity Dispute Notice
to Buyer on or prior to the date that is three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer and the Seller shall discuss in good faith in order to
reach agreement on the Interim Loss Disputed Items set forth in the Interim
Loss Indemnity Dispute Notice. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the Federal Rules of Evidence Rule 408 shall apply to any discussions related
to the Interim Loss Disputed Items between Buyer and the Seller during such
period, including any subsequent disputes arising therefrom. If the Seller and
Buyer do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to the Interim Loss
Disputed Items set

| | 

|

| 



forth in the Interim Loss Indemnity Dispute Notice prior to the date that is
two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, then the remaining Disputed Items
shall be submitted immediately by Buyer and the Seller to an independent
accounting firm of national reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and the
Seller (the "Interim Loss Accounting Firm") and an independent counsel of
national reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Seller (the "Interim
Loss Counsel"). The Interim Loss Accounting Firm and the Interim Loss Counsel
shall be requested to render a written determination (which need not be a
legal opinion) of the Interim Loss Estimate Amount (acting as experts and not
as arbitrators) as promptly as practicable after referral of the matter to
such Interim Loss Accounting Firm and Interim Loss Counsel (but in any event
prior to the Closing), which determination must be in writing and will be
based on the facts and information provided by Buyer and Seller at the time.
The terms of appointment and engagement of the Interim Loss Accounting Firm
and the Interim Loss Counsel shall be as agreed upon between the Seller and
Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall be borne 50% by the Seller and
50% by Buyer. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other costs
and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with resolving any dispute
hereunder before the Interim Loss Accounting Firm and the Interim Loss Counsel
shall be borne by the Party incurring such cost and expense. The determination
of the Interim Loss Accounting Firm and the Interim Loss Counsel shall be
conclusive and binding upon the Parties absent fraud or manifest error. The
Interim Loss Estimate Amount shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the
resolution of any objections thereto pursuant to this Section 2.4(d)(ii), and,
as so revised, such Interim Loss Estimate Amount shall be deemed to set forth
the final Interim Loss Estimate Amount (and corresponding Interim Loss
Indemnity Escrow Amount, Interim Loss Indemnity Threshold and Indemnity
Threshold calculated on the basis thereof), in each case, for all purposes
hereunder.

(iii) None of (A) Buyer's estimate of the Interim Loss Estimated Amount, (B)
the Seller's agreement (or deemed agreement) with Buyer's estimate of the
Interim Loss Estimated Amount, (C) any other agreement between the Buyer and
the Seller with respect to the Interim Loss Estimated Amount pursuant to this
Section 2.4(d) or (D) the determination of the Interim Loss Accounting Firm
and the Interim Loss Counsel pursuant to Section 2.4(d), shall be
determinative of, or deemed to be or construed as an admission by Buyer or the
Seller with respect to, (x) the existence or amount of any Interim Loss, or
(y) whether any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Article IX and/or the amount to which of any Buyer Indemnified
Party may be entitled pursuant to Article IX.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 2.4(d), including the
dispute resolution provisions and the engagement of the Interim Loss
Accounting Firm and the Interim Loss Counsel, shall toll or otherwise extend
or change the Termination Date or the End Date.

Section 2.5 Withholding. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold any amounts they are required to deduct and withhold pursuant to any
provision of the Code or other Law in connection with any payments required to
be made by Buyer or the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Buyer
shall provide prior written notifications to the Seller, as promptly as
practicable following receipt of the Statement and prior to the Closing, of
the approximate amounts that Buyer (or any other withholding agent) intends to
withhold from

| 



the Estimated Purchase Price (determined on the assumption that Seller will
deliver the certificate described in Section 6.2(b) on the Closing Date), and
Buyer will reasonably consider all comments and suggestions that the Seller
may have with respect to such written notification. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Buyer or the Company, such withheld amounts (a) shall be
timely remitted by Buyer or the Company to the applicable Governmental Entity
in accordance with applicable Law and (b) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person otherwise entitled to receive
such payments pursuant to this Agreement.

is in good standing (if applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the property
and assets owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature of the business
conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except in
such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and
in good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The Company has made available to Buyer, prior to the date of this
Agreement, true and complete copies of (x) all Governing Documents of the
Seller and of each other Group Company, in each case as amended to the date of
this Agreement and (y) the minutes from all board of director (or other

any shareholder meetings and since September 1, 2007 (or the date on which the

in violation of, any conversion rights, preemptive rights, rights of first

will be duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the other
Persons party thereto), enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms, except (i) to the extent that enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (ii) that the

to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be
brought.

the absence of footnotes and normal and recurring year‑end adjustments) and
(iii) have been derived from the books and records of the Group Companies.

recorded as necessary to permit materially correct preparation of their
consolidated financial statements and to maintain reasonably accurate
accountability for their assets, (ii) the reporting of their assets is

Sheet, (y) arising in connection with the Transactions or (z) that have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the

Section 3.5 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except as set forth in
Section 3.5 of the Disclosure Letter, no notices to, filings with, or
authorizations, consents or approvals of, any Governmental Entity are
necessary for the execution, delivery or performance by the Seller or any
Group Company of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which the Seller
or any of the Group Companies is a party or the consummation by the Seller and

filings under the HSR Act and other Competition Laws, (ii) those the failure
of which to obtain or make have not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect
and (iii) those that may be required solely by reason of Buyer's (as opposed
to any other third party's) participation in the Transactions. Neither the
execution, delivery or performance by the Seller and the Group Companies of
this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents to which they are a party nor the
consummation by the Seller and the Group Companies of the Transactions will
(a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of any Group
Company's Governing Documents, (b) except as set forth in Section 3.5 of the
Disclosure Letter, conflict with or result in any violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, result in or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration
under, require notice to a third party under, require the payment of a penalty
or increased fees under, or result in the loss of a benefit under, any
Contract, Real Property Lease or permit, license, approval, certificate or
other

authorization of or from any Governmental Entity, (c) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree or Law of any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
any Group Company or any of their respective properties or assets or (d)
except as contemplated by this Agreement or with respect to Permitted Liens,
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the assets of any Group
Company, which in the case of any of clauses (b) through (d) above, have had
or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.6 Material Contracts.

(a) Section 3.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and correct list
as of the date of this Agreement of the following Contracts to which any of
the Group Companies is a party or is otherwise bound:

payments do not exceed $100,000. A true and correct copy of each Real Property
Lease has been made available to Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement.
Except as set forth in Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure Letter, each Real

good condition and repair in all material respects (ordinary wear and tear
excepted) and sufficient for the operation of the business of the Group

conducted, free and clear of all Liens except for Liens identified in Section
3.17(c) of the Disclosure Letter and Permitted Liens. All such items of
tangible personal property which, individually or in the aggregate, are

other similar agreement between the equity owners (or any Affiliate of any
such Person) of Seller and the Company that will be terminated on or prior to
the Closing without any further obligations on the part of any Group Company
thereunder). Except as disclosed in Section 3.18 of the Disclosure Letter, (i)
none of the Group Companies, their respective Affiliates or any of their
respective directors or executive officers or, to the Company's Knowledge, any

Group Company (other than the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary),
director or executive officer of a Group Company or, to the Company's
Knowledge, any relative of any of the foregoing, owns any property right,
tangible or intangible, which is used by a Group Company in the conduct of its
business. Ownership of five percent or less of any class of securities of a
company whose securities are registered under the Securities and Exchange Act

interest for purposes of this Section 3.18.

Section 3.19 Customers. Section 3.19 of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a
list of the 10 most significant customers of the Group Companies, taken as a
whole (the "Key Customers"), based on dollar sales volumes during the 12-month

2013 to the date hereof, none of the Group Companies has received any written
notice, or to the Company's Knowledge any verbal notice, that any Key Customer

Companies has received any written notice, or to the Company's Knowledge any
verbal notice, that any Key Supplier has ceased or materially reduced, or is

provided to any person and Contract commitments and all express and implied
warranties related thereto, as well the published product specifications of
each Group Company and relevant customer. The Group Companies do not have
liabilities for replacement or repair thereof or other damages in connection
therewith, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of $1,000,000 of the
amount reserved against and reflected on the Latest Balance Sheet. Except as
set forth in Section 3.21 of the Disclosure Letter, there is no hazard or
defect in design, manufacture, materials or workmanship, including any failure
to warn or alleged breach of express or implied warranty or representation,
relating to any product produced, licensed, distributed, leased or sold by or
on behalf of any Group Company.

Section 3.22 Inventory. The inventories of the Group Companies shown on the
Latest Balance Sheet consist of items usable and of a quantity and quality
salable in the ordinary course of business (other than with respect to any
slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories that are adequately reserved
against and reflected as such on the Latest Balance Sheet and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows). For the avoidance
of doubt, (x) any changes in market demand following the date of the Latest
Balance Sheet and (y) any promotion, discount, rebate, sale or similar pricing
programs following the date of the Latest Balance Sheet which were implemented
in the ordinary course of business consistent with historical levels
(including with respect to magnitude, timing and volume) shall not cause this
representation and warranty to be untrue.

Section 3.23 EXCLUSIVITY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS
OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY CONTAINED IN ARTICLE III OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE GROUP
COMPANIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR
NATURE, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE CONDITION, VALUE OR QUALITY OF THEIR

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller
Material Adverse Effect. The Seller is duly qualified or licensed to transact
business, and is in good standing (if applicable) in each jurisdiction in
which the property and assets owned, leased or operated by it, or the nature
of the business conducted by it, makes such qualification or licensing

Section 4.2 Authority. The Seller has all limited partnership power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary

those that may be required solely by reason of Buyer's (as opposed to any
other third party's) participation in the Transactions. Neither the execution,
delivery or performance by the Seller of this Agreement or the Ancillary
Documents to which the Seller is a party nor the consummation by the Seller of
the Transactions will (a) conflict with or result in any breach of any

marketable title to such Company Common Stock. The Seller's shares of Company
Common Stock have not been pledged or assigned to any Person and are held free
and clear of all Liens. The Seller has the power and authority to sell,
transfer, assign and deliver such shares of Company Common Stock as provided
in this Agreement and such delivery will convey to Buyer good, valid and
marketable title to such Company Common Stock free and clear of all Liens.

knowledge, threatened against the Seller which, if determined adversely has
had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The Seller is not subject to any outstanding
judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree that has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Seller Material
Adverse Effect.

rights under the directors' and officers' liability insurance policies of the
Group Companies constitute the sole assets of the Seller, and the Seller has

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

Buyer hereby represents and warrants to the Seller and the Company as follows:

Section 5.1 Organization and Qualification. Buyer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware.
Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority and to own, lease and

aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.2 Authority. Buyer has all corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to which Buyer
is a party and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which Buyer is a party and the
consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all requisite
corporate action on the part of Buyer. No vote of Buyer's equityholders is
required to approve this Agreement or for Buyer to consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement has been (and the Ancillary Documents to which
Buyer is a party will be) duly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitutes
a valid, legal and binding agreement of Buyer (assuming this Agreement has
been and the Ancillary Documents to which Buyer is a party will be duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the other parties thereto), enforceable
against the Buyer in accordance with its terms, except (i) to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and (ii) that the availability of equitable
remedies, including specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding thereof may be brought.

Section 5.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. No notices to, filings
with, or authorizations, consents or approvals of any Governmental Entity are
necessary for the execution,


 

--- 
| | 

|

44 

| 



delivery or performance by Buyer of this Agreement or the Ancillary Documents
to which Buyer is a party or the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions,
except for (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and other
Competition Laws, (ii) those the failure of which to obtain or make has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) those set forth in
Section 5.3 of the Disclosure Letter. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which
Buyer is a party nor the consummation by Buyer of the Transactions will (a)
conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of Buyer's Governing
Documents, (b) except as set forth in Section 5.3 of the Disclosure Letter,
conflict with or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, result in or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration under, require notice to
a third party under, require the payment of a penalty or increased fees under,
or result in the loss of a benefit under, any Contract to which Buyer is a
party, or (c) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree or Law of any
Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over Buyer except, in the case of
clauses (b) and (c) above, for violations which have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.4 Brokers. No broker, finder, financial advisor or investment banker
is entitled to any brokerage, finder's, financial advisor's or investment
banker's fee or commission or similar payment in connection with the
Transactions based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates for which the Seller or any Group Company may become liable.

Section 5.5 Financing. Buyer has provided the Seller a true, complete and
correct copy of an executed commitment letter and corresponding customarily
redacted fee letter (none of which redacted terms would reasonably be expected
to adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) from the
financial institutions identified therein (as may be amended or replaced from
time to time to the extent permitted by Section 6.11, the "Debt Financing
Commitment"), to provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt
financing in the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the
Transactions (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing"). The
Debt Financing Commitment is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer
and, to the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, in each case
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other Laws affecting generally the enforcement of creditors' rights and
subject to general principles of equity. As of the date hereof, the Debt
Financing Commitment is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect. As of
the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or default
on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any of the other parties
to the Debt Financing Commitment, or a failure of the conditions to the Debt
Financing. Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in Section
7.1 and 7.2 hereof and the commencement and completion of the Marketing
Period, as of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the
conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment will not be satisfied, or that the
Debt Financing will not be made available on a timely basis in order to
consummate the Transactions. As of the date hereof, no Lender has notified
Buyer of its intention to terminate any of the Debt Financing Commitment or
not to provide the Debt Financing. The net proceeds from


 

--- 
| | 

|

45 

| 



the Debt Financing, together with cash on hand, will be sufficient to
consummate the Transactions, including the payment of any fees and expenses of
or payable by Buyer, or the Company, and any related repayment or refinancing
of any Funded Indebtedness of the Group Companies, and any other amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions.
Assuming the availability of the Debt Financing, Buyer will have cash on the
Closing Date sufficient for the satisfaction of Buyer's obligations under this
Agreement specifically referenced in the immediately preceding sentence. Buyer
has paid in full any and all commitment or other fees required by the Debt
Financing Commitment that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after
the date hereof, all such fees as they become due. The Debt Financing
Commitment is not subject to any conditions precedent to the obligations of
the parties thereunder to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available
to Buyer other than as set forth therein (including the payment of customary
fees). There are no side letters or other Contracts (except for any customary
engagement letter, a true and complete copy of which has been provided to the
Company, with only the fee amounts and certain other terms (none of which
would reduce the aggregate principal amount or affect the conditionality of
the Debt Financing) redacted) relating to the Debt Financing to which Buyer or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party other than as expressly set forth in the
Debt Financing Commitment. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition
to Closing under this Agreement for Buyer to obtain the Debt Financing or any
alternative financing.

Section 5.6 Solvency. Assuming that the representations and warranties in
Articles III and IV are true and correct and that the Seller and the Company
have each complied with their respective obligations under this Agreement, at
and immediately after the Closing, and after giving effect to the Transactions
(including any financings being entered into in connection therewith), each of
the Buyer and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will (a) be solvent
(either because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is
less than the fair value of its assets or because the "fair salable value" of
its assets is greater than the value of "all of its liabilities, including
contingent and other liabilities", as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with applicable federal Laws governing determinations
of insolvency of debtors), (b) have adequate capital with which to engage in
its business and all businesses in which it is about to engage or (c) be able
to pay their debts and obligations as they become due.

Section 5.7 Securities Matters. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Shares
are being acquired by the Buyer for its own account, and not with a view to,
or for the offer or sale in connection with, any public distribution or sale
of the Shares or any interest in them. The Buyer has sufficient knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters to be capable of evaluating the
merits and risks of its investment in the Shares, and the Buyer is capable of
bearing the economic risks of such investment, including a complete loss of
its investment in the Shares. The Buyer acknowledges that the Shares have not
been registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities Laws, and
understands and agrees that it may not sell or dispose of any of the Shares
except pursuant to a registered offering in compliance with, or in a
transaction exempt from, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any other applicable state, foreign or federal securities Laws.

Section 5.8 Acknowledgment and Representations by Buyer. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that it has conducted its own independent review and analysis of
and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the
business, assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Group Companies.
In entering into this Agreement, Buyer has relied

|

| 



upon its own investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties
of the Company and the Seller expressly set forth in this Agreement, and Buyer
acknowledges that, other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement and in
the certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant hereto, none of the
Group Companies or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, stockholders, agents or representatives makes or has made any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, (x) with respect to any
of the Group Companies or their respective businesses, (y) as to the accuracy
or completeness of the Confidential Information Memorandum dated April 2013,
any "teaser" or "management presentation" provided to Buyer and documents and
materials made available in the "data room" or (z) with respect to any
projections, forecasts, estimates, plans or budgets of future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of any Group Company heretofore or
hereafter delivered to or made available to Buyer or any of its agents,
representatives, lenders or Affiliates.

Section 5.9 EXCLUSIVITY OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES MADE BY BUYER IN THIS ARTICLE V ARE IN LIEU
OF AND ARE EXCLUSIVE OF ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING
ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES. BUYER HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH OTHER OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO
THE SELLER, THE COMPANY OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION (INCLUDING
ANY FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS OR OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL DATA).

Section 6.2 Tax Matters.

(a) Transfer Taxes. All transfer Taxes, recording fees and other similar Taxes
that are imposed on any of the Parties by any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions shall be allocated 50 percent to the Group
Companies or Buyer, as the case may be, and 50 percent to the Seller. Each
Party shall use reasonable efforts to avail itself of any available exemptions
from or reductions of any such Taxes or fees, and to cooperate with the other
Parties in providing any information and documentation that may be necessary
to obtain such exemptions or reductions. The party required by Law to file any
Tax Returns with respect to any such Taxes shall (i) prepare such Tax Returns,
(ii) submit such Tax Returns to the other party for its approval, (iii) timely
file such Tax Returns and (iv) timely pay such Taxes to the appropriate
Governmental Entity, subject to such party's liability for such Taxes under
this Section 6.2.

(b) FIRPTA. On the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to Buyer a properly
executed Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act certificate, dated not
more than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C.

(c) No Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter. The transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not part of an intermediary transaction tax shelter as
described in Internal Revenue Service Notices 2001 16 and 2008 111.

(d) Section 338 Election. Buyer shall not make an election pursuant to Section
338 of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Tax Law) with respect to the Transactions.

(e) Post-Closing Tax Benefit.

(i) On the third (3rd) anniversary of the Closing Date , Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to 38% of the aggregate amount of Transaction Tax
Deductions (other than the Transaction Tax Deductions that reduced current Tax
liabilities below what they would otherwise be in the calculation of Net
Working Capital). Nothing in this Section 6.2(e) shall limit or impair the
rights of any Buyer Indemnified Party under Section 9.1; provided that Buyer
shall in no event reduce amounts payable under this Section 6.2(e)(i) by any
items or amounts, including those set forth in Section 9.1.

(ii) The schedule set forth in Section T-1 of the Disclosure Letter (the
"Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule") sets forth Seller's estimates of the
amounts of the Transaction Tax Deductions as of the date of this Agreement. On
or promptly after the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver a certificate
updating the Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule with the actual amount of
each Transaction Tax Deduction, together with evidence of such amounts as
reasonably requested by Buyer, and any change in the amount shown on such
updated Transaction


 

--- 
| | 

|

51 

| 



Tax Deductions Schedule shall be subject to the consent of Buyer (not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The Seller shall determine the
amounts shown as deductible and non-deductible on such updated Transaction Tax
Deductions Schedule in a manner consistent with the practices and
methodologies used to determine the estimates set forth in Section T-1 of the
Disclosure Letter. Buyer may, at any time after the Closing Date, deliver a
certificate further updating such Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule to
reflect the non-deductibility of a compensation expense included on the
Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule because such compensation expense
constitutes a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder,
together with evidence of such non-deductibility determination as reasonably
requested by Seller, and any change to the non-deductibility determination
shown on such further updated Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule shall be
subject to the consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). Buyer and the Seller shall work together in good faith to
resolve differences with respect to the Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule
(including as a result of updates to such schedule by either the Seller or
Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.2(e)(ii)) and to the extent there remains any
disagreement between Buyer and the Seller within thirty (30) days after the
delivery by Seller of the certificate referenced in the second sentence of
this Section 6.2(e)(ii) or Buyer of the certificate referenced in the
immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, the procedures and rules set
forth in the dispute resolution mechanism described in Section 2.4(b) shall
govern mutatis mutandis. The Transaction Tax Deductions shown on the
Transaction Tax Deductions Schedule, as updated pursuant to this Section
6.2(e)(ii), shall be the Transaction Tax Deductions used for purposes of this
Agreement, including Section 6.2(e)(i).

(iii) The Parties shall treat any payment under this Section 6.2(e) as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price unless there is no reasonable basis for doing
so under applicable Tax Law.

(f) Refunds and Credits. Any refund or credit of Taxes of the Group Companies
that were borne by Seller (whether by virtue of having (i) been paid by any of
the Group Companies before the Closing, (ii) been indemnified by the Seller
under Article IX, (iii) reduced any prior payment under this Section 6.2(f) or
(iv) were included as a current liability in Net Working Capital), shall be
for the account of Seller; provided that any such refund or credit shall be
for the account of Buyer or the Group Companies to the extent that such
refunds or credits (x) decreased the amount of any current liability included
in Net Working Capital, (y) are attributable to the carryback from a Post-
Closing Tax Period of items of loss, deductions or other Tax items of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Group Companies) or
(z) are required to be paid by any Group Company to any other Person pursuant
to an agreement described in Section 3.6(a)(x) of the Disclosure Letter. All
refunds or credits of Taxes of the Group Companies (other than those for the
account of Seller pursuant to the previous sentence) shall be for the account
of Buyer. If any Party is entitled to any refund or credit of Taxes under this
Section 6.2(f), then within 10 days after such refund is received or such
credit is allowed or applied against another Tax liability, the Party
receiving such refund or credit shall pay such refund or the amount of such
credit to the other Party; provided, however, that any such amounts paid under
this Section 6.2(f) shall be net of any Tax cost or benefit to the payor Party
attributable to the receipt of such refund or the payment of such amounts to
the payee party. The Parties shall treat any payment under this Section 6.2(f)
as an adjustment to the

| | 

|

| 



Purchase Price unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under
applicable Tax Law. Buyer may reduce any amounts payable under this Section
6.2(f) by the amount of any outstanding Unrecovered Pre-Closing Tax Losses.
Nothing in this Section 6.2(f) shall limit or impair the rights of any Buyer
Indemnified Party under Section 9.1.

(g) Straddle Periods. In any case under this Agreement involving a Straddle
Period: (A) real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes")
for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the amount of such Property
Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days during the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-
Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period; and (B) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be computed as if such taxable period ended as of the close
of business on the Closing Date and, in the case of any Taxes attributable to
the ownership of any equity interest in any partnership, other "flowthrough"
entity or "controlled foreign corporation" (within the meaning of Section
957(a) of the Code or any comparable U.S. state or local or foreign Law), as
if the taxable period of such partnership, other "flowthrough" entity or
controlled foreign corporation ended as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (whether or not such Taxes arise in a Straddle Period of the
applicable owner).

(h) Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller shall cause the provisions of any Tax
sharing agreement between (i) Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Group Companies), on the one hand, and (ii) the Group Companies, on the other
hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the Closing Date,
no party thereto shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax
allocation or Tax sharing agreement.

(i) Tax Returns. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns for the Group Companies for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods that are filed after the Closing Date (each such Tax Return, a "Post-
Closing Tax Return"). To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Post-
Closing Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner that (x) is consistent with
past practice and (y) reports the Transaction Tax Deductions as deductible
items in the taxable period that ends on or otherwise includes the Closing
Date. The Buyer will not take any action, or permit any action to be taken,
that may prevent the taxable year of any Group Company from ending for federal
and (to the extent permitted under applicable state Law) state income Tax
purposes at the end of the day on which the Closing occurs and shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, elect with the relevant taxing authority
to treat for all income Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of a
taxable period of the Group Companies. At least 15 days prior to the date on
which each income Tax Return or other material Tax Return is filed, Buyer
shall submit Post-Closing Tax Returns to the Seller for Seller's review and
approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed). Without
the prior written consent of the Seller, the Buyer will not (i) except for
Post-Closing Tax Returns, file or amend or permit any of the Group Companies
to file or amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other
than solely to carry back items described in Section 6.2(f)(y)); (ii) extend
or waive, or cause to be extended or waived, or permit the Group Companies to
extend or waive, any statute of limitations or other period for the assessment
of any Tax or deficiency related to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) make or
change any Tax election or accounting method that has retroactive effect to
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) elect, or cause


 

--- 
| | 

|

53 

| 



any Group Company to elect, to waive on any Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period any carryback of net operating losses under Section 172(b)(3) of the
Code (or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law) from such
Pre-Closing Tax Period to an earlier Pre-Closing Tax Period.

(j) Pre-Closing Tax Liability True-Up Payment. Within 10 days after the filing
of the last material Post-Closing Tax Return for U.S. federal income Taxes, if
the Pre-Closing Tax Liability True-Up Amount is positive, Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to Pre-Closing Tax Liability True-Up Amount. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Pre-Closing Tax Liability True-Up Amount" means
the aggregate amount of current Tax liabilities included in Net Working
Capital for Taxes reportable on Post-Closing Tax Returns minus the aggregate
amount shown as due and payable with respect to the Pre-Closing Tax Periods on
such Post-Closing Tax Returns. For purposes of the definition of Pre-Closing
Tax Liability True-Up Amount, any Post-Closing Tax Return showing a refund or
credit of Taxes shall be treated as showing an amount of zero as due and
payable and the refund or credit shall be subject to the procedure and rules
set forth in Section 6.2(f).

Section 6.3 Access to Information. From and after the date hereof until the
earlier of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, upon reasonable notice, the Seller shall provide to Buyer and
its authorized representatives during normal business hours reasonable access
to (i) the officers, directors, management, accountants and other advisors of
the Seller and the Group Companies and (ii) the properties, books, records and
Contracts of the Group Companies, which shall include providing Buyer, prior
to the Closing Date, with copies of the Governing Documents of each Group
Company (in each case of clauses (i) and (ii) in a manner so as to not
interfere with the normal business operations of any Group Company). All of
such information shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, during the period from the date hereof until the Closing, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including the Group Companies) shall be
required to disclose to Buyer or any of its representatives any information of
the type described in clause (ii) above (x) (A) if doing so would violate any
Law to which the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including the Group
Companies) is subject or which it reasonably determined upon the advice of
counsel could result in the loss of the ability to successfully assert
attorney-client and work product privileges; provided that the Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such information in a manner
that does not violate any such Law or privilege or (B) if the Seller or any of
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the
other hand, are adverse parties in a litigation and such information is
reasonably pertinent thereto, or (y) relating to Taxes or Tax Returns other
than information relating to the Group Companies. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall deliver (if available after
using commercially reasonable efforts) to Buyer as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement (and in any event prior to the Closing) the
materials and documents, if any, in the possession of the Seller or any of the
Group Companies set forth on Section 6.3 of the Disclosure Letter.

Section 6.4 Efforts to Consummate.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Buyer, the
Seller and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, those things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws and regulations to
consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Transactions


 

--- 
| | 

|

54 

| 



(including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the closing conditions set
forth in Article VII). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Buyer and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain consents of all
Governmental Entities and of any other Person (other than Governmental Entity)
necessary to consummate the Transactions; provided that in connection with
obtaining the consent of any Person other than a Governmental Entity, no Party
will be required to (nor, without the prior written consent of Buyer, will the
Seller or any Group Company) make or agree to make any payment or accept any
material conditions or obligations, including amendments to existing
conditions and obligations. All filing fees incurred in connection with the
filing and compliance under Competition Laws shall be borne by Buyer. Each
Party shall make an appropriate filing, if necessary, pursuant to Competition
Laws with respect to the Transactions promptly (and in any event in the case
of the initial filing required under the HSR Act, within five Business Days)
after the date of this Agreement and shall supply as promptly as practicable
to the appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to Competition Laws.
Without limiting the foregoing, none of Buyer, the Company, the Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates shall elect to extend any waiting period or
comparable period under Competition Laws or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Entity not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior
written consent of the Seller or Buyer, as applicable.

(b) In the event any Proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is
threatened or commenced which questions the validity or legality of the
Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, the Parties agree to
cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to defend against such
Proceeding and, if an injunction or other order is issued in any such
Proceeding, to use commercially reasonable efforts to have such injunction or
other order lifted, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment
to the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 6.5 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation (and
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of the directors, officers,
employees and agents of each Group Company, as provided in such Group
Company's Governing Documents in effect as of the date hereof and pursuant to
the agreements set forth in Section 6.5 of the Disclosure Letter, in each case
with respect to any matters occurring prior to the Closing Date, shall survive
the consummation of the Transactions and shall continue in full force and
effect and that Buyer shall cause the Group Companies to perform and discharge
the Group Companies' obligations to provide such indemnity and exculpation
after the consummation of the Transactions. The indemnification and liability
limitation or exculpation provisions of the Group Companies' Governing
Documents shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, as of the Closing Date or at any time prior to the Closing
Date, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Seller or any Group
Company, unless such modification is required by applicable Law.

(b) Buyer shall cause the Company to, and the Company shall, purchase and
maintain in effect beginning on the Closing and for a period of six years
thereafter without any lapses in coverage, a "tail" policy providing
directors' and officers' liability insurance coverage


 

--- 
| | 

|

55 

| 



(including any policy providing coverage for combined fiduciary and employment
practices liability) for the benefit of those Persons who are covered by
Seller's or any Group Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies as of the date hereof or at the Closing with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Closing. Such policy shall provide coverage that is
materially comparable to the coverage provided under the Seller's or any Group
Companies' directors' and officers' liability insurance policies as of the
date hereof (the "Existing Policy"); provided that the Company shall not pay
or covenant to pay more than 300% of the Existing Policy's existing insurance
premium in order to obtain such policy (which existing policy amount the
Company represents and warrants is set forth in Section 6.5 of the Disclosure
Letter; provided that the Company may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does
not result in gaps or lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing Date.

(c) The directors, officers, employees and agents of Seller and each Group
Company entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation, exculpation and
insurance set forth in this Section 6.5 are intended to be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.5. This Section 6.5 shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions and shall be binding on all successors and
assigns of Buyer and the Company.

Section 6.6 Exclusive Dealing. During the period from the date of this
Agreement through the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, neither the Seller nor the Company
shall take, or permit any of their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, representatives, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants or other agents to take, any action to solicit, encourage,
initiate or engage in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
information to or enter into any agreement with any Person (other than Buyer
and/or its Affiliates) concerning any purchase of any of the Company's equity
securities or any merger, sale of substantial assets or similar transaction
involving the Group Companies, other than assets (other than equity interests)
sold in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (each such
acquisition transaction, an "Acquisition Transaction").

Section 6.7 Documents and Information. After the Closing Date, Buyer and the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company and the Group Companies to, until
the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other
documents pertaining to the business of the Group Companies in existence on
the Closing Date and, subject to compliance with applicable Law, make the same
available for inspection and copying by the Seller (at the Seller's expense)
for any reasonable business purpose during normal business hours of the
Company or any of the Group Companies, as applicable, upon reasonable request
and upon reasonable notice; provided that Buyer shall not be required to
disclose to the Seller any information if the Seller or any of its Affiliates,
on the one hand, and Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
adverse parties in a litigation and such information is reasonably pertinent
thereto. No such books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date by Buyer or any of the Group Companies,
without first advising the Seller in writing and giving the Seller a
reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof (subject in each case to
compliance with applicable Law).

Section 6.8 Contact with Customers, Suppliers and Other Business Relations.
During the period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Closing Date

|

| 



or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer
hereby agrees that neither Buyer nor any of its employees, agents,
representatives or Affiliates shall initiate any contact with any non-
management employee, customer, supplier, distributor or other material
business relation of any Group Company regarding any Group Company, its
business or the Transactions without first notifying the Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply
with respect to any communications or sharing of information pursuant to this
Section 6.8.

Section 6.9 Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
or cause its Subsidiaries (including the Group Companies) to provide employees
of each Group Company who continue to be employed by a Group Company with (1)
the same salary or hourly wage rate as provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (2) employee benefits (excluding equity
arrangements) that are either (A) the same as provided to such employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date or (B) at least as favorable as those
provided to similarly situated employees of Buyer and its Subsidiaries. Buyer
further agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall and shall
cause each Group Company to grant all of its employees credit for any service
with such Group Company earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for eligibility
and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and severance
benefit determinations under any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement that may be established or maintained by Buyer or the
Company Entity or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date (the
"New Plans"); provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.
In addition, Buyer shall (A) cause to be waived all pre‑existing condition
exclusions and actively‑at‑work requirements and similar limitations,
eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under
any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an employee or his or her
dependents under any Employee Benefit Plan as of the Closing Date and (B)

after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation, provided that the Group Companies (or their insurers) use their
commercially reasonable best efforts to provide this information to Buyer in a
timely manner. Buyer agrees that Buyer and the Company shall be solely

vesting to be effective no later than one business day preceding the

written resolutions and such amendment will be preapproved by Buyer, such
approval not unreasonably withheld, and the Group Companies will deliver
notice of the Group Company 401(k) Plan termination to participants and any
trustees and custodians of each Group Company 401(k) Plan and/or its assets.

(d) Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon
any employee of any Group Company any right to continued employment for any
period or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan or
Employee Benefit Plan (or an undertaking to amend any such plans) or limit the
rights of Buyer or any Group Company to amend, modify or terminate any such
plans pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms thereof. The provisions
of this Section 6.9 are solely for the benefit of the Parties, and no current
or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor or any other
Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 6.9 of this
Agreement.

(e) The Company agrees that any Seller Expenses of the type described in
clause (ii) of the definition thereof, to the extent paid at or prior to the

Expenses and are to paid by any Group Company following the Closing shall be
paid in accordance with such payroll procedures.

Section 6.10 Disclosure Letter. Concurrently with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, the Company and the Seller has delivered to Buyer a
confidential disclosure letter (the "Disclosure Letter"). The Disclosure
Letter is hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set
forth in full herein. The mere inclusion of information in the Disclosure
Letter as an exception to a representation, warranty or covenant (i) shall not
be deemed an admission by any Party that such information represents a
material exception or a material fact, event or circumstance or that such
information has had or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or a Seller Material
Adverse Effect, as applicable, or (ii) constitute, or be deemed to be, an
admission to any third party concerning such information. Matters disclosed by
the Seller to the Buyer pursuant to any Section of this Agreement (or any
section of the Disclosure Letter) will be deemed to be disclosed with respect
to all Sections of this Agreement (and all sections of the Disclosure Letter)
to the extent the disclosure is reasonably apparent from its content and
context to be relevant to such other Sections or sections. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Letter but not otherwise defined therein will have the
respective meanings assigned to such terms in this Agreement.

in the aggregate than those contained in the Debt Financing Commitment, (iv)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Buyer contained in the
Debt Financing Commitment within its control, including the payment of any
commitment, engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt

the Closing Date (it being understood that it is not a condition to Closing
under this Agreement for Buyer to obtain the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Debt Financing). Buyer shall keep the Seller and the Company informed on a
reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing (including providing the Seller and the Company
with copies of all executed definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing (subject, in the case of any fee letter or engagement letter related
to the Debt Financing, to customary redactions (none of which redacted terms
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the principal amount or
availability of the Debt Financing))). Buyer shall give the Seller and the
Company prompt notice upon having knowledge of any breach by any Lender under
the Debt Financing Documents or any termination of any of the Debt Financing
Documents. Other than as set forth in this Section 6.11, Buyer shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Seller, amend, modify, supplement or
waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Debt
Financing Documents or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt
Financing Documents (other than in accordance with the "market flex"
provisions), in each case to the extent such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver would reasonably be expected to have the effect of (A)
adversely affecting in any material respect the ability of Buyer to timely
consummate the Transactions, (B) amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving
the conditions or contingencies to the Debt Financing in a manner materially
adverse to the Company or the Seller or (C) materially delaying the Closing;
provided that notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer
shall be entitled from time to time to amend, restate, replace, supplement or
otherwise modify the Debt Financing Commitment for the purpose of adding
agents, co-agents, lenders, arrangers, bookrunners or other Persons that have
not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, in each
case, subject to subclauses (A), (B) and (C) above. Upon any such amendment,
supplement or modification, in accordance with the terms of this Section
6.11(a), the term "Debt Financing Commitment" shall mean for all purposes of
this Agreement the Debt Financing Commitment as so amended, supplemented or
modified. Buyer shall promptly deliver to the Seller and the Company true and
complete copies of any such amendment, supplement or modification (with only
the fee amounts and certain other provisions redacted, which redacted
provisions shall not affect the principal amount or availability of the Debt
Financing).

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable, Buyer
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange to promptly obtain the
Debt Financing or such portion of the Debt Financing from alternative sources,
which may include one or more of a senior secured debt financing, an offering
and sale of notes, or any other financing or offer and sale of other debt
securities, or any combination thereof, in an amount sufficient, when added to
any portion of the Debt Financing that is available and cash on hand and other
readily available liquidity, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
Buyer in connection with the Transactions ("Alternative Debt Financing") and
(ii) obtain a new financing commitment letter (the "Alternative Debt
Commitment Letter") and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that
provides for financing

(A) on terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer (taking
into account the "market flex" provisions of the existing Debt Financing
Commitment), (B) containing conditions to draw and other terms that would
reasonably be expected to affect the availability thereof that (1) are not
more onerous, taken as a whole, than those conditions and terms contained in
the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof and (2) would not
reasonably be expected to delay the Closing and (C) in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that is available
and cash on hand and other readily available liquidity, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Buyer in connection with the Transactions. In
such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any Alternative Debt Financing, and the term "Debt Financing
Commitment" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Debt Commitment Letter.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Seller and the Company shall provide, shall
cause the Company's Subsidiaries to provide, and shall use its reasonable best

sessions, due diligence sessions and rating agency presentations; (ii)

required by regulatory authorities and as reasonably requested by Buyer with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with applicable

consummation of the Closing and (ii) nothing herein shall require any
cooperation by the Company or the Seller to the extent it would interfere

their respective subsidiaries. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the
Seller nor any Group Company nor any of their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors
(including legal, financial and accounting advisors) shall incur any liability
to any person under or in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the

jurisdiction, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, the Group
Companies and their respective Affiliates and directors, officers, employees,
representatives and advisors (including legal, financial and accounting

nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, provided that such
conditions are capable of being satisfied at the Closing), (ii) to the extent
that the Marketing Period has ended, or is capable of ending, prior to the
Termination Date or End Date, as applicable, the Seller has irrevocably
confirmed by written notice to Buyer after the end of the Marketing Period
that all conditions set forth in Section 7.3 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at
the Closing, provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied at
the Closing) or that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in
Section 7.3 and that the Seller and the Company are ready, willing and able to
consummate the Closing, and (iii) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within
five (5) Business Days following the date on which the Closing should have
occurred pursuant to Section 2.2 due to a Financing Failure; provided, that
any termination of this Agreement by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(d) shall be
deemed a termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if prior to the time of
such termination the conditions of clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section 8.1(g)
have been satisfied; or

(h) by Buyer, if Seller has made an Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Reduction
Election.

Section 8.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
this entire Agreement shall forthwith become void (and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of Buyer, the Seller or the Company or
their respective officers, directors or equityholders) with the exception of
(a) the provisions of this Section 8.2, Article X (other than Section 10.1)
and the last sentence of Section 6.11(c), each of which provisions shall
survive such termination and

| 



remain valid and binding obligations of the Parties, and (b) any liability of
any Party for fraud, willful misconduct or intentional or willful breach
(which, in the case of Buyer, shall be deemed to include a failure by Buyer to
consummate the Closing within five (5) Business Days following the date on
which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section 2.2 if (i) there
has not been a Financing Failure, (ii) all of the conditions set forth in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 have been satisfied (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing,
provided that such conditions are capable of being satisfied at the Closing),
and (iii) to the extent that the Marketing Period has ended, or is capable of
ending, prior to the Termination Date or End Date, as applicable, the Seller
has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Buyer after the end of the
Marketing Period that all conditions set forth in Section 7.3 have been
satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, provided that such conditions are
capable of being satisfied at the Closing) or that it is willing to waive any
unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.3 and that the Seller and the Company are
ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing) of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations under this Agreement
prior to such termination (which liability, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
not necessarily be limited to reimbursement of expenses); provided that if
this Agreement is terminated or deemed terminated by the Seller pursuant to
Section 8.1(g), then Buyer shall pay an amount equal to $49,250,000 (the
"Termination Fee") to the Seller one (1) Business Day after such termination,
by wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by the Seller. In
the event of a termination of this Agreement where the Seller is entitled to
receive the Termination Fee, the Seller's right to receive payment of the
Termination Fee from Buyer pursuant to this Section 8.2(a) shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against Buyer, the
Lenders, the Lender Related Parties, their respective Affiliates and their
respective Affiliates' directors, officers, managers, members, shareholders,
partners, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Buyer Related Parties") for any loss or damage suffered as
a result of the breach of this Agreement or any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein by Buyer (other than pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), if applicable) or the failure of the Transactions to be
consummated, and upon payment of the Termination Fee in accordance with this
Section 8.2(a), none of the Buyer Related Parties shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions.

(b) If Buyer fails to timely pay the Termination Fee when due pursuant to
Section 8.2(a) and, in order to obtain the payment, the Seller commences a
Proceeding which results in a judgment (or any settlement payment) against
Buyer or any other party for payment of the Termination Fee, Buyer shall pay
the Seller its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with such Proceeding, together with
interest on such amount at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum for the
period beginning on the date such payment was required to be made and ending
on the date such payment was actually received.

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2
are an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that
the Termination Fee, in the circumstances in which such fee becomes payable,
constitutes liquidated damages and is not a penalty.

(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") against any Losses based upon,

(a) For the purposes of this Article IX, any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement (as well as any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement), as well as any Losses
resulting from any such breach or inaccuracy, shall be determined without
giving effect to any limitations or qualifications regarding materiality, the
use of the word "material", "material respects", "Company Material Adverse
Effect", "Seller Material Adverse Effect", "Buyer Material Adverse Effect", or
any similar term, qualification or limitation based on materiality contained
herein (including any reference to the Group Companies as a whole).

(b) (i) Other than with respect to the Company Fundamental Representations,
the Seller Fundamental Representations and the representations under Section
3.15, the Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Party and shall not have any liability under Section 9.1(ii) in respect of any
individual claim for a Loss or series of related claims for Losses incurred or
suffered by the Buyer Indemnified Party, unless such Loss or series of related

Losses (other than Interim Losses) shall be indemnifiable claims and subject
to indemnification hereunder counted against the Indemnity Threshold and (y)
all such Losses that are Interim Losses shall be indemnifiable claims and
subject to indemnification hereunder counted against the Interim Loss
Indemnity Threshold; and any individual Loss (or series of related Losses)
less than the Per-Claim Threshold (unless it is part of a series of related
Losses that aggregate to the Per-Claim Threshold) shall not be aggregated for
purposes of calculating whether or not Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
exceed the Indemnity Threshold or the Interim Loss Indemnity Threshold, as
applicable.

(ii) Other than in the case of indemnification claims for Interim Losses or
with respect to the Company Fundamental Representations, the Seller
Fundamental Representations and the representations under Section 3.15, the
Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party and
shall not have any liability under Section 9.1(ii) until such time as the
aggregate of all claims for Losses (other than claims for Interim Losses) that
the Buyer Indemnified Parties may have under Section 9.1(ii) and any
applicable Ancillary Document exceeds the Indemnity Threshold, and then only
to the extent such Losses exceed the Indemnity Threshold. Except as set forth
in the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller shall not be required to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party and shall not have any liability under
Section 9.1(ii) with respect to Interim Losses until such time as the
aggregate of all claims for Interim Losses that the Buyer Indemnified Parties
may have under Section 9.1(ii) exceeds the Interim Loss Indemnity Threshold,
and then only to the extent such Interim Losses exceed the Interim Loss
Indemnity Threshold.

(iii) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) "Company Fundamental
Representations" shall mean the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization and Qualification of the Group
Companies), Section 3.2 (Capitalization of the Group Companies), Section 3.3
(Authority), Section 3.6(d) (Material Contracts), Section 3.16 (Brokers) and

| 



Representations" shall mean the representations and warranties of the Seller
under Section 4.1 (Organization and Qualification), Section 4.2 (Authority),
Section 4.4 (Title to Stock), Section 4.6 (Assets and Operations of Seller)
and Section 4.7 (Voting Requirements).

(c) (i) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
and shall not have any liability under Section 9.1 for amounts in the
aggregate in excess of the Indemnity Escrow Amount (other than with respect to
Interim Losses) and Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party and shall not have any liability under Section 9.1 other
than out of the Indemnity Escrow Account (other than with respect to Interim
Losses) .

(ii) In calculating amounts payable to an indemnified party hereunder, the
amount of any indemnified Loss shall be determined without duplication of such
Loss for which an indemnification claim has already been made under any other
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

(iii) Seller shall not be required to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
and shall not have any liability under Section 9.1 other than out of the
Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Account and, subject to Section 9.5, the
Indemnity Escrow Account.

(d) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under Section
9.1 or Section 9.2 shall be (i) net of any actual cash payments, setoffs or
cash recoupment of any payments (including insurance proceeds or any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payments (other than from (x) any
self-insurance programs, (y) the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy
and (z) any Ancillary Document)), in each case actually received, realized or
retained by the indemnified party as a result of any event giving rise to a
claim for such indemnification (net of costs, expenses and Taxes incurred in
obtaining any such payment, recoupment or setoff); provided that the amount
deemed to be recovered under insurance policies will also be net of the
deductible for such policies, any increase in the premium (and retro-premium
adjustments) for such policies to the extent arising out of or in connection
with such Losses, (ii) net of an amount equal to any Tax benefit actually
realized by the indemnified party in connection therewith (determined on a
"with and without" basis) in the taxable period of the Loss and for the three
taxable periods that follow, and (iii) increased by any Taxes incurred by the
indemnified party as a result of receiving any indemnity payment under Section
9.1 or Section 9.2 with respect to such Loss. If any such actual cash
payments, setoffs or cash recoupment of any payments or any such Tax benefits
are received by an indemnified party with respect to any Losses after the
indemnifying party made a payment hereunder to the indemnified party with
respect thereto, then the indemnified party shall promptly pay to the
indemnifying party the amount (less any expenses and Taxes incurred in
obtaining any such payments, setoffs, recoupments or Tax benefits) of any
payments, setoffs, recoupments or Tax benefits received or retained (up to the
amount of the indemnifying party's prior payment to the indemnified party
related thereto).

(e) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL
BE LIABLE TO OR OTHERWISE RESPONSIBLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ANY
AFFILIATE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO FOR SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN SUCH CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES TO THE EXTENT
REASONABLY FORESEEABLE),

|

71 

| 



EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A PARTY'S OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY
FOR AMOUNTS PAID TO A THIRD PARTY WHERE SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES ARE AWARDED PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM (OR SETTLEMENT THEREOF)
THAT IS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION HEREUNDER. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, ANY
FINES OR PENALTIES PAYABLE TO A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE
SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

Section 9.4 Release from Indemnity Escrow Account. Any amounts in the
Indemnity Escrow Account and/or the Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Account will
be released in accordance with Section 1.4 of the Escrow Agreement, and shall
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Section 9.5 Limitation on Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
any Ancillary Document and, in the case of the Buyer Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy, from and after
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of each Buyer Indemnified Party and
Seller Indemnified Party as against any Indemnifying Party, with respect to
all claims of any nature whatsoever relating to the Transactions, including
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement, shall be pursuant to and limited by the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article IX, it being understood that (x) the
foregoing limitations shall not apply in respect of a claim of fraud or for
the remedies of injunctive relief or specific performance set forth herein and
(y) nothing in this sentence shall operate to interfere with or impede the
operation of the provisions of Section 2.4 or 6.2(e). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth herein, but except as otherwise expressly provided
in any Ancillary Document, (A) any amount to which any Buyer Indemnified Party
is entitled pursuant to this Article IX (other than with respect to Interim
Losses) shall be limited to, and solely satisfied from, the funds that remain
in the Indemnity Escrow Account at the time and shall be claimed by such Buyer
Indemnified Party upon the provision of a notice of a claim in such amount to
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement and (B)
any amount to which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled pursuant to this
Article IX with respect to Interim Losses shall be limited to, and solely
satisfied from, the funds that remain in the Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow
Account at the time and shall be claimed by such Buyer Indemnified Party upon
the provision of a notice of a claim in such amount to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement; provided, that to the
extent the amount of funds in the Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Account is, at
any time, less than or equal to the aggregate amount to which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties are entitled under this Article IX with respect to Interim
Losses (such shortfall, the "Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Shortfall Amount"),
then the Buyer Indemnified Parties may satisfy such liability from any
remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Account, and such funds shall be
claimed by such Buyer Indemnified Party upon the provisions of a notice of a
claim in the amount of the Interim Loss Indemnity Escrow Shortfall Amount to
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

Section 9.6 Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (as
the case may be, the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled to any
indemnification pursuant to this Article IX


 

--- 
| | 

|

72 

| 



in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand (other than a Tax
Claim) made by any Person against such Indemnified Party (a "Third Party
Claim"), such Indemnified Party must notify the indemnifying party in writing
of (and in reasonable detail regarding) the Third Party Claim promptly, and in
any event within 10 Business Days, after receipt by such indemnified party of
written notice of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to
give such notification shall not affect the indemnification provided under
this Agreement except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
prejudiced as a result of such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party
shall deliver to the indemnifying party, promptly following the Indemnified
Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim.

(b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, subject to the limitations contained in this Section 9.6(b) and the
consent rights of any Insurer or other limitations in the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy, to assume and control the defense thereof of such
Third Party Claim if it so chooses with counsel selected by the indemnifying
party and not reasonably objected to by the Indemnified Party. Should the
indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that the assumption of
such defense by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to an actual
or potential conflict of interest or (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have
been advised by counsel that one or more defenses are available to the
Indemnified Party that are not available to the indemnifying party (provided
that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the fees and expenses of
more than one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Party, other than local
counsel). If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
at its own expense counsel not reasonably objected to by the indemnifying
party, separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense and shall be
empowered to make any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim,
subject to the remaining terms of this Section 9.6(b). The indemnifying party
shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by
the Indemnified Party for any period during which the indemnifying party has
not assumed the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend
or prosecute any Third Party Claim, all the Parties shall cooperate and shall
cause their Affiliates to cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
party's request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making
employees available on any basis reasonably requested by the indemnifying
party to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder or otherwise relating to the Third Party Claim, provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be required to produce any
records or information that would result in a loss of privilege or violate any
confidentiality obligation. Whether or not the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except if (x) the
Indemnified


 

--- 
| | 

|

73 

| 



Party is reasonably expected to be liable for Losses in excess of amounts
reasonably expected to be received from the indemnifying party, (y) such
settlement or compromise is in respect of a proceeding that seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or (z) in the
case of any Buyer Indemnified Party, the failure to admit liability with
respect to, or settle, compromise of discharge, such Third Party Claim could
cause any Buyer Indemnified Party to lose coverage under the Representation
and Warranty Insurance Policy. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense
of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any settlement,
compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim that the indemnifying party
may recommend and that by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay
the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim and
which releases the Indemnified Party completely in connection with such Third
Party Claim, which does not contain any admission of wrongdoing or misconduct
by the Indemnified Party and which does not involve any non-monetary relief.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (and shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel incurred by the Indemnified Party in
defending such Third Party Claim) if (x) the Third Party Claim seeks an order,
injunction or other equitable relief or relief for other than money damages
against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party reasonably
determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages, (y) in the event the Third Party
Claim were to be unfavorably decided, the Indemnified Party would be
reasonably likely to be liable for Losses in excess of amounts reasonably
expected to be received from the indemnifying party or (z) in the case of a
Third Party Claim against a Buyer Indemnified Party (i) the assumption of the
defense by the indemnifying party could cause any Buyer Indemnified Party to
lose coverage under the Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy or (ii) a
Buyer Indemnified Party or any Insurer is required to assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim pursuant to the Representation and Warranty Insurance
Policy. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third Party
Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the indemnifying party
shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money
damages.

(c) Each of Buyer and the Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing
upon receipt of notice of any pending or threatened Tax Proceeding with
respect to Taxes for which the Seller may be liable under this Article IX or,
in the case of receipt by the Seller, which could adversely impact any of the
Group Companies (a "Tax Claim"); provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification under this Agreement except
to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced as a result of
such failure. The Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense in
the defense of and, at its option, control of the defense of, any Tax
Proceeding regarding Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which the Seller
may be liable under Article IX, and to employ counsel and other advisors of
its choice at its expense, other than any Tax Proceeding relating to Taxes
with respect to Straddle Periods, which shall be jointly controlled by Buyer
and the Seller. If the Seller so opts to control Tax Proceedings for a Pre-
Closing Tax Period, Buyer shall be entitled to participate at its expense in
the defense of any Tax Proceeding that could adversely impact any of the Group
Companies and to employ counsel and other advisors of its choice at its
expense. The Seller may not agree to settle, compromise or discharge, or admit
any liability with respect to any claim for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without Buyer's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Seller shall be entitled to participate
at its expense in the defense of any Tax Proceedings regarding Taxes for


 

--- 
| | 

|

74 

| 



a complete Post-Closing Tax Period for which the Seller may be liable under
Article IX. None of the Group Companies shall agree to settle, compromise or
discharge, or admit any liability with respect to any material claim for Taxes
referenced in the preceding sentence without the Seller's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

(d) In the event any Indemnified Party shall have an indemnification claim
against any indemnifying party under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, as
applicable, that does not involve a Third Party Claim or Tax Claim being
asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim to the indemnifying
party. The failure by any Indemnified Party so to notify the indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability that it may
have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party has been prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not
notify the Indemnified Party within 10 Business Days following its receipt of
such notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the
indemnified party under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, such claim specified by
the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability
of the indemnifying party under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2 and the
indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the Indemnified
Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim
(or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of
such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

(e) Promptly following the final resolution of the last indemnification claim
under this Article IX with respect to Interim Losses (the date of such final
resolution, the "Interim Loss Determination Date"), Buyer shall pay, in cash
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Seller, to the extent
such amount is a positive number, the Indemnity Adjustment Payment.

Section 9.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Seller and Buyer shall treat
any indemnity payments made pursuant to this Article IX and any Applicable
Ancillary Document as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes
unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under applicable Tax Law.

Section 9.8 [Intentionally Omitted].

Section 9.9 Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy. Seller and the
Company acknowledge that Buyer is entering into the Representation and
Warranty Insurance Policy and that, in connection therewith, a Buyer
Indemnified Party may make claims for the same Loss or series of related
Losses under both this Article IX and the Representation and Warranty
Insurance Policy. Seller and the Company further acknowledge and agree that
the denial of any claim by any Buyer Indemnified Party under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance Policy shall not be construed as, or
used as evidence that, such Buyer Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification under this Article IX.

ARTICLE X 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.1 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Company, the
Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
under this Agreement will survive the Closing solely for purposes of Article
IX, and will terminate on the 12-month anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Expiration Date"); provided that if any Party makes a claim, in accordance
with Section 9.6 with respect to any specific representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement prior to the Expiration Date, and such claim is not
fully and finally resolved prior to the Expiration Date, such representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive solely with respect to such
claim until such claim is finally and fully resolved. The covenants and
agreements of the Parties which by their terms contemplate actions or impose
obligations following the Closing shall survive the Closing and remain in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the covenants and
agreements of the Parties which by their terms contemplate full performance at
or prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing until the 12- month
anniversary of the Closing Date.

Section 10.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure

Ancillary Documents constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all other prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, that may have been made or entered
into by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates
relating to the Transactions.

Section 10.3 Assignment. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party
hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise), other than for collateral
purposes, without the prior written consent of Buyer and the Seller; provided
that Buyer may, without the consent of the Seller, assign, in its sole
discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any of its direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries, but no
such assignment shall relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder. Any
attempted assignment of this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of
this Section 10.3 shall be void.

Section 10.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 10.6 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Ancillary Documents, including the fees and disbursements of counsel,
financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by the Party incurring such
fees or expenses; provided that in the event that the Closing is consummated,
Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, pay all Unpaid Seller Expenses.

Section 10.7 Press Releases and Announcements. The initial press release by
Buyer with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed by the Parties, and none of the Parties nor any of their
respective representatives shall issue any other press releases or make any
other public announcements with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions
without the prior written consent of Buyer or the Seller, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such press release or public announcement,
including the disclosure of this Agreement, may be made if required by
applicable Law or a securities exchange rule; provided that the Party required
to make such press release or public announcement shall, to the extent
practicable, confer with the other Parties concerning the timing and content
of such press release or public announcement before the same is made.

Section 10.8 Construction; Interpretation. The term "this Agreement" means
this Stock Purchase Agreement together with the Disclosure Letter and exhibits
hereto, as the same may from time to time be amended, modified, supplemented
or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The headings contained in
this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. No Party, nor its
respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of this Agreement for purposes
of construing or enforcing the provisions hereof, and all provisions of this
Agreement shall be construed according to their fair meaning and not strictly
for or against any Party, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise
favoring or disfavoring any Person by virtue of its authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified: (i) the words,
"herein", "hereto", "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Disclosure Letter and exhibits, and not to
any particular section, subsection paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained
in this Agreement; (ii) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and
neutral genders, and vice versa; (iii) words importing the singular shall also
include the plural, and vice versa; (iv) the words "include", "includes" or
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(v) the word "or" shall be deemed to be inclusive and not exclusive; and (vi)
whenever the words "made available to Buyer" or similar words are used in this
Agreement with respect to any documents or other information, such words shall
mean that such documents or information were available to Buyer prior to and
through the date of execution of this Agreement in the electronic dataroom
maintained on behalf of the Company by Intralinks (as evidenced by the
Dataroom Record).

Section 10.9 Exhibits and Disclosure Letter. All exhibits and the Disclosure
Letter or other documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof as
if set out in full in this Agreement. Any item

|

| 



disclosed in any section of the Disclosure Letter referenced by a particular
section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have been disclosed with respect
to every other section in this Agreement to the extent the disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face to be relevant to such other sections. The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in any
section of the Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that such amounts,
or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts
or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy as to whether
any obligation, items or matter not described herein or included in any
section of the Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

Section 10.10 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each Party and its successors and permitted
assigns and, except as provided in Section 6.5 and Article IX, nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Lender Related
Party shall be an express third party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to
rely upon and enforce Sections 8.2(a), 10.12, 10.15 and 10.16 and this Section
10.10. In addition, the Company agrees, on behalf of itself, its Affiliates
and their respective directors, officers, managers, members, stockholders,
partners, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the "Company Related Parties") that the Lenders, their
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, managers, members,
stockholders, partners, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Lender Related Parties") shall be
subject to no liability or claims (whether legal or equitable, arising under
contract, tort or otherwise) by the Company Related Parties arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing Commitment
or the Transactions or in connection with the Debt Financing, or the
performance of services by such Lender Related Parties with respect to the
foregoing.

Section 10.11 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable
under applicable Law, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Section 10.12 Amendment. Prior to the Closing, this Agreement may be amended
or modified only in accordance with a written agreement executed and delivered
by duly authorized officers of Buyer and the Seller. After the Closing, this
Agreement may be amended or modified only by written agreement executed and
delivered by duly authorized officers of Buyer and the Seller. This Agreement
may not be modified or amended except as provided in the immediately preceding
two sentences and any purported amendment by any Party or Parties hereto
effected in a manner which does not comply with this Section 10.12 shall be
void. Notwithstanding anything

| 



herein to the contrary, Sections 8.2(a), 10.10, 10.15 and 10.16 and this
Section 10.12 (and any provision of this Agreement of the extent a
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the
substance of Sections 8.2(a), 10.10, 10.15 and 10.16 and this Section 10.12)
may not be modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse in any
material respect to the Lender Related Parties without the prior written
consent of each Lender.

Section 10.13 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, the Seller
(on behalf of itself and the Company) may (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Buyer contained herein,
(b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Buyer
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by Buyer
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance by Buyer with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer may (i)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the Company or the Seller contained herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Company and the Seller contained herein
or in any document, certificate or writing delivered by the Company or the
Seller pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance by the Company and the Seller
with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of any Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Party. Any waiver
of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any Party to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

Section 10.14 Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or scanned pages shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 10.15 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EACH HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING, DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY, UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR
RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES HERETO IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO (INCLUDING ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, UNDER THE
DEBT FINANCING, ANY ALTERNATIVE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT,
ANY ALTERNATIVE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF THE
FOREGOING), IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE
OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES
TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT
WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE
WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 10.16 Jurisdiction and Venue. Each of the Parties submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (or, if
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware), in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the Parties
waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any Proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each Party agrees that
service of summons and complaint or any other process that might be served in
any Proceeding may be made on such party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the Party to be served at the address of the Party and in the
manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.4. Nothing in this
Section 10.16, however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal
process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each Party agrees that a final,
non-appealable judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and
may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by
law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Parties agrees that it will
not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third
party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether
in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Lender Related Parties
in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
Debt Financing Commitment or the performance of any of the foregoing, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the County
of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal court.

Section 10.17 Remedies.

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein (including Section 8.2(a)),
any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy,
would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to
comply with its obligations under Section 6.11 or take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate the Transactions) in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly
agreed that, subject to Section 8.2 and Section 10.17(b), prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Section
6.11 and each Party's obligations to consummate the Transactions if it is
required to do so hereunder), in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Subject to Section 10.17(b), the foregoing right
shall include the right of the Company or the Seller to cause Buyer to comply
with its obligations under Section 6.11 with respect to the Debt Financing
Commitment. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of
an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant


 

--- 
| | 

|

82 

| 



to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other Parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the Company's
and the Seller's ability to seek specific performance of Buyer's obligations
to effect the Closing under Section 2.2 shall be subject to the requirements
that (i) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the Closing
and (ii) the Company and the Seller have irrevocably confirmed by written
notice to Buyer that all conditions set forth in Section 7.3 have been
satisfied (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Closing) and that if specific performance is granted and
the Debt Financing is funded, then each of them will take such actions under
their control to cause the Closing to occur.

Section 10.18 Non-Recourse. All claims or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the other Ancillary
Documents (including any representation or warranty made in or in connection
with this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents), may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto and
thereto. No Person who is not a named party to this Agreement or the other
Ancillary Documents, including any past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney or representative of any named party to this Agreement or the other
Ancillary Documents ("Non-Party Affiliates"), shall have any liability
(whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or based upon any theory
that seeks to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or
affiliates) for any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection
with or related to this Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the
case may be) or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or such other Ancillary Document (as the case may be) or the
negotiation or execution hereof or thereof; and each Party waives and releases
all such liabilities, claims and obligations against any such Non-Party
Affiliates. Non-Party Affiliates are expressly intended as third party
beneficiaries of this provision of this Agreement.

Section 10.19 Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has
acted as legal counsel to the Seller and its Affiliates and the Group
Companies prior to the Closing, and that Kirkland and Ellis LLP intends to act
as legal counsel to the Seller and its Affiliates (which will no longer
include the Group Companies) after the Closing, each of Buyer and the Company
hereby waives, on its own behalf and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive,
any conflicts that may arise in connection with Kirkland and Ellis LLP
representing the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates after the Closing as such
representation may relate to Buyer, any Group Company or the Transactions. In
addition, all communications involving attorney client confidences between the
Seller, its Affiliates or any Group Company and Kirkland and Ellis LLP in the
course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the Transactions
shall be deemed to be attorney client confidences that belong solely to the
Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies). Accordingly, the
Group Companies shall not, without the Seller's consent, have access to any
such communications, or to the files of Kirkland and Ellis LLP relating to its
engagement with respect to the Transactions, whether or not the Closing shall
have occurred. Without limiting the generality

|

| 



of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Seller and its
Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall be the sole holders of the
attorney client privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the
Group Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent that files of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the Seller and its Affiliates (and not the Group Companies) shall
hold such property right and (iii) Kirkland and Ellis LLP shall have no duty
whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney client communications or
files to any of the Group Companies by reason of any attorney client
relationship between Kirkland and Ellis LLP and any of the Group Companies or
otherwise. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 10.19, the
Seller and its Affiliates shall cause Kirkland and Ellis LLP to keep the files
and communications referred to in the foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii)
confidential and this Section 10.19 shall not constitute or be construed as a
waiver or release of Kirkland and Ellis LLP's obligation to keep confidential
any information with respect to the Group Companies in its possession.
