THE MERGER



SECTION 2.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.3),
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "
_Delaware Act_ "), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation and shall succeed to and assume all the
rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the Delaware Act. The
Company as the surviving corporation after the Merger is sometimes referred
to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_."



SECTION 2.2. _Consummation_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated and the
Merger shall have been abandoned pursuant to Article VIII, and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the
consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 12:00 p.m.,
New York Time, as soon as possible, but in no event later than four business
days after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII
(the " _Closing Date_ "), at the offices of Morrison Cohen Singer and Weinstein,
LLP, located at 750 Lexington  



 

3  Avenue, New York, New York 10022 (or such other place or time as Parent and
the Company may jointly designate).



SECTION 2.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable after satisfaction or,
to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the
Company and Merger Sub shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate
of Merger_ "), with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make
all other filings or recordings required by the Delaware Act in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "
_Effective Time_ ") as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the
Certificate of Merger).



SECTION 2.4. _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the Delaware Act.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



SECTION 2.5. _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time at or after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things
are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise
in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any
of the rights, properties or assets of either of the Company or Merger Sub
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver and shall execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf
of either the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
each of such corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as
may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.



SECTION 2.6. _Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws, Directors and Officers_.



(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately before the Effective Time shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided by the Delaware Act and such certificate of incorporation. 



(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
as provided by the Delaware Act, the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation and such bylaws.



(c) From and after the Effective Time, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately before the Effective Time will continue as the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, and except as Merger Sub may otherwise notify the
Company in writing prior to the Effective Time, the officers of the Company
immediately before the Effective Time will be the initial officers of the  



 

4  Surviving Corporation, in each case until their successors are elected or
appointed and qualified. If, at the Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on
the board of directors or in any office of the Surviving Corporation, such
vacancy may thereafter be filled in the manner provided by the Surviving
Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the Delaware Act.



SECTION 2.7. _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any of the following securities:



(a) Except as provided in clauses (b) and (c) below, each share of Company
Common Stock (as defined in Section 4.2(a)) issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time (such shares of Company Common Stock,
other than shares described in clauses (b) and (c) below, are hereinafter
referred to as the " _Shares_ ") shall be converted into the right to receive
$4.87 (the " _Per Share Amount_ ") in cash payable to the holder thereof,
without interest, upon surrender of the certificate representing such Share or
an affidavit with respect thereto, in each case in accordance with Section
2.8. As of the Effective Time, all Shares so converted shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any such
Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except to receive
the aggregate Per Share Amount applicable thereto, in accordance with Section
2.8.



(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
Delaware Act (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the aggregate Per Share Amount applicable thereto as provided in
Section 2.7(a) above and in accordance with Section 2.8 below, but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive the aggregate Per Share Amount applicable thereto as provided in
Section 2.7(a) above and in accordance with Section 2.8 below. The Company
shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any shares
of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the Delaware Act received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing with respect thereto.



 

5 (c) Each share of Company Common Stock that is held as treasury stock or owned
by the Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub immediately before the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and extinguished and shall
cease to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.



(d) Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
extinguished and each shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.



SECTION 2.8. _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.



(a) Before the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company to receive the funds necessary
to make the payments contemplated by Section 2.7(a) and to make such payments
on a timely basis. The Surviving Corporation shall, on or before the Closing
Date, deposit, or cause to be deposited, in trust with the Exchange Agent for
the benefit of holders of Shares, funds in amounts sufficient for the payments
under Section 2.8(b) to which such holders shall be entitled at the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 2.7(a). Such funds shall be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, provided however that such
funds may only be invested in (i) direct obligations of, or obligations the
principal of and interest on which are unconditionally guaranteed by,
the United States of America with a remaining term at the time of acquisition
thereof not in excess of 90 days, (ii) money market accounts or certificates
of deposit maturing within 90 days of the acquisition thereof and issued by a
bank or trust company organized under the laws of the United States of
America or a State thereof having a combined capital surplus in excess of
$500,000,000 (a " _United States Bank_ "), (iii) commercial paper issued by a
domestic corporation and given a rating of no lower than A1 by Standard and
Poors Corporation and P1 by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. with a remaining
term at the time of acquisition thereof not in excess of 90 days or (iv)
demand deposits with any United States Bank. The earnings from, and interest
or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to Parent or as
Parent directs.



(b) The Surviving Corporation agrees that as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time it shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute to holders
of record of Shares as of the Effective Time a form of letter of transmittal
and instructions for its use in effecting the surrender of the certificates
representing the Shares in exchange for the aggregate Per Share Amount
relating thereto in a customary form reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company prior thereto. Such letter shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass from such holder, only upon
proper delivery of the certificates representing the Shares to the Exchange
Agent for use in the exchange. Upon receipt of a properly executed letter of
transmittal together with the requisite documentation specified in the letter
of transmittal, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to
promptly pay the holder of such certificates in exchange therefor cash in an
amount equal to the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares
represented by such certificate or certificates. Until so surrendered,
each such certificate (other than certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock held by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or Appraisal Shares)
shall represent solely the right to receive the aggregate Per Share Amount
relating thereto. 



 

6 (c) If payment of cash in respect of canceled Shares is to be made to a Person
(as defined in Section 9.4) other than the Person in whose name a surrendered
certificate or instrument is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the certificate or instrument so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes
required by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established
to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent that
such tax either has been paid or is not payable, all of which shall be
specified in the letter of transmittal.



(d) If any certificate or certificates representing Shares shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such certificate or certificates to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
require as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such certificate or certificates, the Exchange Agent will issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates the
Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares represented by such
certificate or certificates payable pursuant to this Agreement.



(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall not be any further registration of transfers of any
shares of capital stock thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after
the Effective Time, certificates for Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for cash as provided in
Section 2.7(a). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of a certificate or certificates which immediately before the
Effective Time represented outstanding Shares.



(f) Promptly following the date which is six months after the Effective
Time, the Parent may cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to the Parent all
cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any holder of a certificate or
certificates representing Shares who has not theretofore complied with this
Section 2.8 shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of the Per Share Amount multiplied by the number of Shares represented
by such certificate or certificates, subject to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law, all without interest. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Shares 18 months after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when amounts would

Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub does not, and the performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by each of Parent and
Merger Sub will not, (i) conflict with or violate any law, statute,
regulation, court order, judgment, decree or other restriction of any
government, governmental agency or court applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or
by which any of their respective properties  



 

9  or assets is bound or affected, (ii) violate or conflict with the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or other organizational documents of
Parent or Merger Sub, or (iii) result in any breach of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a

of, or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of the property

instrument, permit, license or franchise to which any of Parent or Merger Sub

Financing Letter has been furnished to the Company. Each of the Financing
Letters is in full force and effect and has not been amended or modified in
any respect, all commitment fees required to be paid thereunder have been paid
in full or will be duly paid in full when due, and no event has occurred which
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a default
thereunder on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or, to the knowledge of Parent,
the Lenders, as the case may be. Except as set forth in the Financing Letters,
the Lenders have not advised Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates of any facts which cause them to believe the financings
contemplated by the Financing Letters will not be consummated substantially in

aggregate Per Share Amount for the Shares pursuant to Article II, to pay all
amounts required to be paid to holders of Company Stock Options and Company
Warrants hereunder, to refinance the Indebtedness of the Company and
its Subsidiaries that may become due as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (assuming the accuracy of the condition
contained in Section 7.3(g) hereof), to pay all related fees and

including the Merger and the Financing. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is in
breach or default of any obligation owed to any creditor for borrowed money or
any other creditor who may have a lien or other encumbrance on any of its
rights and assets. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has, either voluntarily or
involuntarily, (i) admitted in writing that it is or may become unable to pay

Sub, and as of the Effective Time, to the knowledge of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, on a consolidated basis, are not engaged, nor currently
contemplate being engaged, in a business or transaction for which any property
remaining with them would be insufficient to continue to operate their
businesses or to pay their debts generally as they come due.



SECTION 3.7. _Legal Proceedings_.



(a) There are no claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending
(or, to the knowledge of Parent, threatened) against Parent or Merger Sub that
would materially and adversely affect Parents or Merger Subs ability to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(b) There is no order, writ, injunction or judgment to which Parent or Merger
Sub is subject that would materially and adversely affect Parents or Merger

of the shares of any class of equity or convertible securities of the
Company.



SECTION 3.9. _No Prior Activities_. Except for obligations or liabilities
incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (including any Financing), Merger Sub has

this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall direct the Company
Representatives (as defined in Section 5.2 (b)) to, immediately cease any
activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 5.2 (c)).



(b) Except as permitted by this Section 5.2, and subject to Section 6.7
below, the Company shall not, and it shall direct its Subsidiaries and the

32 (c) As used in this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings set forth

or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision contained in

the material terms and conditions of such Company Superior Proposal and
identifying the Person making such Company Superior Proposal. For purposes of
this Agreement, a " _Company Superior Proposal_ " means any Acquisition
Proposal on terms which the Board of Directors determines in its good faith
judgment (after consultation with their advisors) to be more favorable to the
Companys stockholders than the Merger (taking into account any factors
relating to such proposed transaction deemed relevant by the Board of
Directors, including, without limitation, the financing thereof, any break-up
fees, expense reimbursements and all other conditions thereto).



(e) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs (a),
(b) and (d) of this Section 5.2, the Company shall no later than 24 hours
after the receipt thereof advise Parent orally and in writing of any
Acquisition Proposal, or of any request for information relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business,
properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
stockholders by any Third Party that to the knowledge of the Company is
seeking to make, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall keep
Parent informed in all material respects, on a prompt basis, of the status
and material terms, conditions and other details of any such Acquisition
Proposal, indication or request.



 

33 (f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or any other provision hereof shall
prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making such disclosure to the
Companys stockholders as, in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors, after consultation with outside counsel, is required under
applicable law.

(a) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date, or (ii) the termination of this
Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall prepare and file on

extension has been granted as permitted hereunder) on or before the Closing
Date, and shall pay all Taxes (including estimated Taxes) due on such Tax
Return (or due with respect to Tax Returns for which an extension has been
granted as permitted hereunder) or which are otherwise required to be paid at
any time prior to or during such period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared
in accordance with the most recent Tax practices as to elections and
accounting methods except for new elections that may be made therein that were
not previously available, subject to Parents consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed).



(b) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date, or (ii) the termination of
this Agreement, to the extent any of the Company and its Subsidiaries has
knowledge of the commencement or scheduling of any Tax audit, the assessment
of any Tax, the issuance of any notice of Tax due or any bill for collection
of any Tax due or the commencement or scheduling of any other administrative
or judicial proceeding with respect to the determination, assessment or
collection of any Tax of the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company shall
provide prompt notice to Parent of such matter, setting forth information (to
the extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable detail
and including copies of any notice or other documentation received from the
applicable Tax authority with respect to such matter.



(c) Until the earlier of (i) the Closing Date, or (ii) the termination of
this Agreement, none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall take any of the
following actions without the Parents consent: (i) make, revoke or amend any
Tax election; (ii) execute any waiver of restrictions on assessment or
collection of any Tax; or (iii) enter into or amend any agreement or
settlement with any Tax authority.



(d) All tax-sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or
involving the Company or its Subsidiaries pursuant to which any of them has
a current obligation to make a payment under such an agreement shall be
terminated prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing Date, none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of such agreements and arrangements.



(e) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall retain copies of all Tax Returns,
schedules, workpapers, records and other documents in its possession relating
to Tax matters for periods or portions thereof before the Closing Date until

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



SECTION 6.1. _Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Statement_.



 

(a) In accordance with the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws, the Company
shall call and hold a meeting of its stockholders as promptly as practicable
for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the Merger, and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold such stockholder meeting as
promptly as practicable after the date on which the Proxy Statement (as
defined below) is cleared by the SEC. Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Board of
Directors shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger by the Companys stockholders. As promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, and
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to have cleared by the SEC, and
promptly thereafter shall mail to stockholders, a proxy statement (the "
_Proxy Statement_ ") in connection with the meeting of the Companys
stockholders to consider the Merger (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_").
The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each will promptly and timely cooperate and
provide all information relating to its respective businesses or operations
necessary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement to satisfy all requirements of
applicable state and federal securities laws. The Company and Parent (with
respect to Parent and Merger Sub) each shall be solely responsible for any
statement, information or omission in the Proxy Statement relating to it (and
Merger Sub with respect to Parent) or its Affiliates based upon written
information furnished by it (or Merger Sub with respect to Parent)
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.



(b) The Company agrees that the Proxy Statement will not, at the time the
Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC
or first sent to stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
no representation, warranty or covenant is hereby made, or will be made, by
the Company with respect to Parent and Merger Sub Information (as defined in
Section 6.1(c)).



(c) Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that none of the information supplied
in writing by Parent or Merger Sub, or any of their respective officers,
directors, representatives, agents or employees (the " _Parent and Merger Sub
Information_ "), for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, at the time the Proxy Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) is filed with the SEC or first sent to
stockholders, at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the
Effective Time, will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.



SECTION 6.2. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. The Company shall, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and its  



 

35  accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time to their respective
employees, properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during
such period, shall furnish such information concerning its businesses,
properties and personnel as Parent shall reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , such access shall not unreasonably disrupt the Companys or its
Subsidiaries respective operations and must be conducted in accordance with
the reasonable procedures established by the Company. All nonpublic
information provided to, or obtained by, Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be "Evaluation Material" for purposes
of the 2003 Confidentiality Agreement, by and between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect. Nothing
in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement shall in any way limit any
partys ability to consult any tax advisor (including a tax advisor
independent from all other entities involved in the Transaction) regarding the
Tax Treatment or Tax Structure of the Merger. For purposes of this
provision, " _Tax Treatment_ " is strictly limited to the purported or
claimed U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement and " _Tax Structure_ " is strictly limited to any fact that may be
relevant to understanding the purported or claimed U.S. federal income tax
treatment of the Merger, and neither term includes information relating to the
identity of any party to the Merger or any of such partys representatives,
the existence and status of negotiations between the parties, or financial,
business, legal or other information regarding a party (or any of its
representatives), to the extent not related to the Tax Treatment or Tax
Structure of the Merger. These provisions are meant to be interpreted so as
to prevent the Merger from being treated as offered under "conditions of
confidentiality" within the meaning of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not
be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not
provide to Parent by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations, which
constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is required to keep confidential by reason
of contract, agreement or other obligation to third parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of such
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records that were requested by
Parent but withheld because of such impediments to disclosure.



SECTION 6.3. _Public Announcements_. The parties shall issue a joint initial
press release announcing the execution of this Agreement as may be mutually
agreed. Thereafter, the parties will consult with one another prior to issuing
any press release or otherwise making any public communications in connection
with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and

extent practicable in light of disclosure requirements imposed by applicable
law) to review and comment upon, such filings.



 

36 SECTION 6.4. _Approvals and Consents; Reasonable Best Efforts; Cooperation_.



(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) promptly apply for, diligently

(b) In addition to the other obligations set forth in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, this Section 6.4 and Section 6.7,
from and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, each of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause

necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws, regulations or otherwise
to consummate and make effective as expeditiously as practicable, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation, (i) filing as soon as practicable after the date hereof (the "
_Filing Date_ ") a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with the

and cooperating with each other to obtain all permits and clearances of
Governmental Entities that are necessary, and preparing any document or other

information necessary to consummate the Merger, and fully carrying out the
purposes of, this Agreement. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that, except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
they will not take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect or materially delay the Effective Time or the ability of any
of the parties to satisfy any of the conditions to the Effective Time or to
consummate the Merger.



(c) In furtherance of and without limitation of the foregoing, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) respond as promptly as practicable to
any reasonable inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Entity
for additional information or documentation;  



 

37  (ii) promptly notify the other parties hereto of any written communication
to that party or its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity and, subject
to applicable law, permit the other parties to review in advance any proposed
written communication to any of the foregoing (and consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection therewith); and (iii) furnish the
other parties with copies of all material correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one

the prompt completion of the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(d) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall pursue all of their
legal alternatives with respect to the HSR Act, any relevant foreign
antitrust authority or any effort to have lifted any injunction, order or
decree of a court or other Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or
other legal bar to consummation of the Merger. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing sentence, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall take
any and all reasonable steps necessary to respond to and satisfy any concerns
raised by any Governmental Entity in any administrative, judicial or
legislative action or proceeding. Parent and the Company shall each pay one
half of any filing fees required to be paid in connection with the HSR Act and
any relevant foreign antitrust authority.



(e) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the resignations of each of the officers and directors of the Subsidiaries of
the Company, which resignations shall be effective as of the Effective Time.



SECTION 6.5. _Indemnification; Insurance_.



(a) It is understood and agreed that, subject to the limitations on
indemnification contained in the Delaware Act, the Company Certificate and
other applicable law, the Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable law and regardless of whether the Merger becomes effective,
indemnify and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall for a period of six years following the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and hold
harmless, each director and officer of the Company or any Subsidiary (and,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as members of any committee
of the Board of Directors) on the date hereof or at the Effective Time
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
without limitation liabilities arising under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act in connection with the Merger, and in the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (i) the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of not more than one (1) counsel selected
by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company or the Surviving Corporation, promptly as statements therefor are
received, and (ii) the Company and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in
the defense of any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed).  



 

38  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall be
entitled to assume the defense of any such matter and upon such assumption
Parent shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 6.5 shall promptly notify Parent upon learning of any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of Parent under this Section 6.5
except to the extent that Parent is prejudiced by any failure of an
Indemnified Party to so notify Parent.



(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain or obtain officers and directors
liability insurance covering the Indemnified Parties who currently or at the
Effective Time are covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policies on terms not less favorable than those in effect on the
date hereof in terms of coverage and amounts; _provided_ , _however_ , that if
the aggregate annual premiums for such insurance at any time during such
period exceed 150% of the premium paid by the Company for such insurance as
of the date of this Agreement, then the Surviving Corporation shall provide
the maximum coverage that will then be available at an annual premium equal to
150% of such per annum rate as of the date of this Agreement. This Section
6.5 shall survive consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding Section 9.7,
this Section 6.5 is intended to be for the benefit of and to grant third-party
rights to the Indemnified Parties whether or not they are parties to this
Agreement, and each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to enforce
the covenants contained herein.



(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.5.



(d) Following the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Corporation jointly and
severally agree to pay all expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, that
may be incurred by the Indemnified Parties in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section 6.5 provided that it is
ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified hereunder. Such fees shall be paid by the Parent or Surviving
Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding at the request of the Indemnified Party within twenty days after
the receipt by Parent or Surviving Corporation of a statement or statements
from the Indemnified Party requesting such advance or advances from time to
time. Such statement or statements shall reasonably evidence the expenses and
costs incurred by him in connection therewith and shall include or be
accompanied by an undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party that
he is entitled to receive indemnity pursuant to this Article VI and to repay
such amount if it is ultimately determined that Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified against such expenses and costs by the Parent or
Surviving Corporation as provided by this Agreement.



SECTION 6.6.  _Employee Benefit Matters_. Until the first anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide the
employees of the Surviving  



 

39  Corporation and their dependents with an employee benefit program providing
benefits that are substantially equivalent to the benefits provided to
such persons immediately prior to the Effective Time under the applicable
terms of the ERISA Benefit Plans or Non-ERISA Commitments. Subject to the
foregoing, Parent may permit the Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate
any of the ERISA Benefit Plans or Non-ERISA Commitments after the Effective
Time, subject to their terms and applicable law. To the extent that any ERISA
Benefit Plans or Non-ERISA Commitments are amended or terminated after the
Effective Time so as to reduce the benefits that are then being provided with
respect to participants thereunder, the Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to permit each individual who is then a participant or beneficiary
in such terminated or amended ERISA Benefit Plans or Non-ERISA Commitments to
participate in a comparable employee benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the eligibility criteria thereof, provided
that: (a) such participants shall receive full credit for all years of
service with the Company for all purposes for which such service is
recognized under such plan, including, but not limited to, recognition of
service for eligibility and vesting and level of benefits, (b) such
participants shall participate in such plan on terms that are no less
favorable than those offered to similarly situated employees of the Surviving
Corporation, and (c) such participants shall participate under any welfare-
type benefit plan without any waiting periods, evidence of insurability or
application of any pre-existing condition restrictions (except to the extent
any such limitation has not been satisfied under any applicable ERISA Benefit
Plans or Non-ERISA Commitments in which the participant then participates or
is otherwise eligible to participate), and shall receive appropriate credit
for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductibles, co-payments or out-of-
pocket limits.



SECTION 6.7. _Financing_.



(a) Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the Lenders or other entities to fund
the financing provided for in the Financing Letters. In the event that at any
time funds are not or have not been made available (or, to the knowledge of
Parent, are not reasonably likely to be made available) pursuant to the
Financing Letters so as to enable Parent to proceed with the Merger in a
timely manner, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain alternative funding in an amount at least equal to the
amount to be provided pursuant to the Financing Letters on terms and
conditions substantially comparable to those provided in the Financing
Letters, or otherwise on terms acceptable to each of Parent and Merger Sub in
its sole discretion (" _Alternative Financing_ ") and (ii) shall continue to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.



(b) Following the date hereof, any amendment, modification, termination or
cancellation of the Financing, or any information which becomes known to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates which makes it
reasonably unlikely that the Financing will be obtained substantially on the
terms set forth in the Financing Letters, shall be promptly disclosed to the
Board of Directors. Upon the expiration of ten (10) business days following
receipt by the Board of Directors of any such notice, and until such time as
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Board of Directors with written
documentation which, in the reasonable discretion of the Board of Directors,
adequately demonstrates the availability of Alternative Financing to  



 

40  Parent and Merger Sub, the restrictions against the Company contained in
Section 5.2(a), (b) and (d) above shall no longer apply or be deemed to have
any legal force or effect.



SECTION 6.8. _Advice of Changes_. The Company shall promptly advise Parent of
any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it or which it
believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material
breach of any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
promptly supplement or amend the Schedules delivered in connection with the
execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Schedules or which is necessary to correct
any information in such Schedules which has been rendered inaccurate thereby.
No supplement or amendment to such Schedules shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section
7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) hereof.

satisfied and received a calculation, in reasonable specificity, as to the

have been consummated by April 30, 2004 (the " _Outside Date_ ") for any

43  whose action or failure to act, in either case in violation of the
provisions of this Agreement, has been a principal cause of or resulted in the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before such date.



(e) By the Company, if (i) any of the representations and warranties of
Parent and Merger Sub contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and
correct such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) with respect to
representations and warranties would not be satisfied, or (ii) Parent or
Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to comply with any of their

Proposal.



SECTION 8.2. _Effect of Termination_.



(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by any of the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and have no further force or effect, without
any liability or obligation on the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
other than the second sentence of Section 6.2, and those provisions of this
Agreement that expressly survive termination hereof and except that nothing
herein shall relieve (i) any party from liability, at law or in equity, for
their failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Sections 7.2(a), 7.2(b),
7.3(a) or 7.3(b), as the case may be, or (ii) the Company of its obligations
or liability under Sections 8.2(b), 8.2(c) and 8.2(d).



 

44 (b) If (i) the Company, Parent or Merger Sub terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(g), (ii) the Company, Parent or Merger Sub terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and, prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting being held, there shall have been made an Acquisition
Proposal pursuant to which the Companys stockholders would receive cash,
securities or other consideration having an aggregate value, when taken
together with the value of any securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries
otherwise held by such stockholders after such event, in excess of $4.87 per
share of Company Common Stock, which Acquisition Proposal is consummated
within 12 months of termination of this Agreement, or (iii) (x) if Parent or
Merger Sub terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section
8.1(f), (y) the Company is in breach of any of the covenants contained in the
first and third sentences of Section 6.1(a) hereof, and (z) Parent is not in
breach of the covenant contained in the penultimate sentence of Section
6.1(a), the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid to Parent, upon
termination (or upon consummation of the Acquisition Proposal in the case of
clause (ii) above), an amount equal to $5,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ")
plus the documented reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Parent and
Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, the investigation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Company, and the
negotiation and drafting this Agreement (including without limitation, legal,
accounting, commitment, consulting and other fees), not to exceed $1,800,000
(collectively, " _Deal Expenses_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event will the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.



(c) If (i) Parent, Merger Sub or the Company terminates this Agreement

are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay any amount

expenses incurred by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with a legal action to
