as independent expert (the " **Independent Expert** ") to produce a fairness
opinion regarding the terms of the French Offer (the " **Fairness Opinion**

shareholders of Target (each of whom holds 2% or more of Targets Shares
outstanding at the date hereof) to tender their Shares, whether directly or
indirectly held, to the French Offer and/or to the U.S. Offer,
which undertakings together represent approximately 10% of the Target
Shares outstanding at the date hereof.

liability insurance policy in effect on the date of this MOU (the "
**Existing D andO Policy**") for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Settlement Date, and such insurance policy shall be on terms no less
favorable to Target than those of the Existing DandO Policy; _provided_ , that
in no event shall Bidder be required to pay, with respect to the entire six-
year period following the Settlement Date, premiums for insurance under this
Article 3.2.4 that in the aggregate exceed 300% of the aggregate premiums

its management time, if:

  



  

a) the Target Board either does not make the Board Recommendation on or prior
to 15 September 2008, or withdraws or modifies the Board Recommendation
and/or recommends a tender offer from a third party;

  



  

b) a third party files a tender offer before Bidder has filed the French

c) the French Offer is withdrawn pursuant to article 232-11 of the AMF
Regulation.

  



  

The payment of such Break Fee shall occur within ten (10) calendar days of

acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Article 3.3 are an
integral part of the Offers and that, without these agreements, Bidder would
not enter into this MOU.

  



        
   

  



  

The payment of any amounts due pursuant to this Article 3.3 shall not
constitute the exclusive remedy of Bidder under this MOU. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, in the event of a breach (or deemed breach)
by the Target of Article 3.1.5, Bidder may seek any and all other remedies
available at law or in equity to which Bidder is entitled.

the Offers, to:

  



  

(a) remain committed by their undertakings and commitments towards past or
current employees and _mandataires sociaux_  (together, the " **Employees**

benefits (together, the " **Benefits** "), as such Benefits existed on 30
June, 2008 (subject to amendments either made since such date in the ordinary
course of business or agreed upon with Bidder); and

  



  

(b) subject to (a) above, provide the Employees with benefits under employee
benefit plans which are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
currently provided by Target to such Employees.

  



  

 **5.** ** _COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES_**

  

 ** **

  

The Parties undertake to cooperate for the purpose of completing the Offers
and the acquisition of Target by Bidder or an affiliate of Bidder described
in this MOU and have agreed, based on the circumstances existing at the date
hereof, on an indicative timetable for the French Offer which is set out in
**_Annex 4_**.

cooperate and promptly inform each other with respect to issuing all
notifications, making any requests and obtaining all necessary approvals and
authorizations under all laws and regulations of any relevant jurisdictions
and each of the Parties shall, provided that it does not have adverse
consequences for such Party or any member of its group: (i) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, as soon as practicable after the date of this
MOU, all necessary no-action letters, approvals and authorizations from
governmental entities, including the European Commission, the US Department
of Justice and any other local antitrust authority; and (ii) take all
reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or
to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental entity.

  



  

Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party: (i) if and to the extent it
becomes aware that any information supplied by it or included in filings with
the AMF in respect of the French Offer or with the SEC in respect of the U.S.
Offer shall have become false or misleading in any material respect; and (ii)
upon the receipt of any comments from the AMF or the SEC or any request from
the AMF or the SEC for amendments or supplements to filings, in each case, in
respect of the French Offer or the U.S. Offer.

  



        
   

  



  

To the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, Target shall give
Bidder the opportunity to consult with Target with respect to any litigation
commenced prior to, on or after the signing of this MOU, against Target or
any of its officers or directors by any holder of Shares, Targets ADSs,
Warrants or Stock Options relating to this MOU, the Offers or otherwise, and
shall not settle or offer to settle any such litigation without the prior
written consent of Bidder (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

all the Stock Options shall be exercisable as of the date of the opening of
the French Offer until seven (7) trading days prior to the closing of the
reopened French Offer pursuant to article 232-4 of the AMF General
Regulation; and (ii) thereafter, any Stock Options outstanding held by any
person (other than a person whose only interest, present or potential, in the
share capital of Target just before the modification referred to above was
stock options vested and in the money based on the price of the French offer)
shall expire and shall not be exercisable.

If the Offers are successful, each beneficiary of Stock Options with
an exercise price superior to EUR 9.50 that have not been exercised by the

equal to EUR 0.5 per Stock Option Out of the Money in consideration for the
immediate and irrevocable waiver of their rights in connection with all such
options, such payment being made as follows:

  



  

50% of such payment shall be made three (3) months following the publication
by the AMF of the definitive results of the French Offer (after its reopening
pursuant to article 232-4 of the AMF General Regulation) and 50% of such
payment shall be made nine (9) months following the publication by the AMF of
the definitive results of the French Offer (after its reopening pursuant to
article 232-4 of the AMF General Regulation), provided that the relevant
payment is to be made only if such beneficiary is still an employee of Target
and that no beneficiary of Stock Options out of the Money shall receive in
aggregate more than EUR 10,000, or less than EUR 1000, in respect of all such
